Previous work treated it as a regression problem by giving different scores on normal and anomaly events. However, the widely used mini-batch training strategy may suffer from the data imbalance between these two types of events, which limits the model's performance. In this work, a cross-epoch learning (XEL) strategy associated with a hard instance bank (HIB) is proposed to introduce additional information from previous training epochs. Two new losses are proposed for XEL to achieve a higher detection rate as well as a lower false alarm rate of anomaly events. Moreover, the proposed XEL can be directly integrated into any existing WSAD framework. Experimental results of three XEL embedded models have shown promising AUC improvement (3%\u223c7%) on two public datasets, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods.

Under the bisection framework, solving this problem amounts to solving a sequence of convex conic feasibility checking problems (CCFCP). Unfortunately, the problem size of the CCFCP of the CF massive MIMO system grows rapidly as the number of users and access points (AP) increases. Existing feasibility checking methods become computationally intractable even when the system consists of only a moderate number of users and APs. To address this limitation, we propose to reformulate the CCFCP as a two-set feasibility problem, which is then solved by the averaged alternating reflection (AAR) algorithm. The proposed method outperforms existing methods significantly in terms of computational efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09560084.pdf","startPage":"2102","endPage":"2106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3117729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3117729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Max-Min Power Control for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems: An Alternating Projection-Based Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Massive MIMO","Power control","Downlink","Symmetric matrices","Fading channels","Training","Precoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cell-free massive MIMO","CCFCP","feasibility checking","AAR"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Max-Min Power Control for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems: An Alternating Projection-Based Approach","volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9560084/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61829103, 61871421 and 61871091"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Max-Min Power Control for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems: An Alternating Projection-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"lsp-fang-3117729-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051279S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9560084","onlineDate":"06 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9560099,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan Ye","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Key Laboratory of Digital TV System of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen City, Research Institute of Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Kuan","lastName":"Ye","orcid":"0000-0002-9960-4685"},{"name":"Cong Zou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Key Laboratory of Digital TV System of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen City, Research Institute of Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Zou","orcid":"0000-0002-1319-7143"},{"name":"Fang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Key Laboratory of Digital TV System of Guangdong Province and Shenzhen City, Research Institute of Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0003-3575-5086"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"9560099","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"","file":"/ielx7/4563994/9583306/9560099/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-3118047.jpg","coverImage":"/ielx7/4563994/9583306/9560099/graphical_abstract/jphot-gagraphic-3118047.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Wireless communication","Optical attenuators","Bit error rate","Fading channels","Optimization","Attenuation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC)","simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT)","dual-hop transmission"]}],"abstract":"The most significant challenge of underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) system is to overcome its limited coverage. To expand the achievable communication range, we investigate the performance of the dual-hop UOWC system with simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT). The time splitting (TS) method is adopted for wireless power transfer in the proposed system, where the information and energy are transmitted in different phases. A suitable transmission strategy is designed for the model without additional power supply, which contains three phases, i.e. information transmission, energy transmission, and forwarding process. The expressions of the average bit error rate (BER) at the target node and the energy harvested by the relay node are derived over underwater attenuation channel. Then, the effects of the TS factor and the distances on the system performance are investigated in two sub-problems, which minimize the average BER while satisfying the energy harvesting and transmitting rate constraints. Numerical results indicate the performance improvement by adopting the relay node with SLIPT.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Hop Underwater Optical Wireless Communication System With Simultaneous Lightwave Information and Power Transfer","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3118047","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/9583306/09560099.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3118047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9583306","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560099/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Hop Underwater Optical Wireless Communication System With Simultaneous Lightwave Information and Power Transfer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/9560099/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7300107","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010261","fundingName":"Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871255"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Dual-Hop Underwater Optical Wireless Communication System With Simultaneous Lightwave Information and Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"jphot-yang-3118047-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069192S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"9583306","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","xplore-issue":"9583306","articleId":"9560099","onlineDate":"06 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9560136,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Rossi","affiliation":["University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9664397/9560136/rossi-3114881-small.gif","p":["Davide Rossi (Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2012.","He has been a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering \u201cGuglielmo Marconi,\u201d University of Bologna, since 2015, where he is currently an Assistant Professor.

Here Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) base station is the primary base station under which femtocells are deployed. MIMO with spatial modulation transmits the signal to the femtocell. Multiple IoT devices are connected with femtocell and share the same communication resources. Beamforming allows a proficient organization of intercell interference for short-distance data transmission. Weighted majority co-operative game based femtocell selection and beam allocation strategy is proposed here. The performance of the proposed approach is measured by simulation results which illustrates that the proposed architecture diminishes power consumption by 10-15%. Comparative analysis with existing approaches shows that it is a novel and green approach.","doi":"10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560217","publicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560113/9560114/09560217.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Majority Game-based Femtocell Selection and Beam Allocation for 5G-IoT","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560217/","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Majority Game-based Femtocell Selection and Beam Allocation for 5G-IoT","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"28 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9560217/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-4 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012905","fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology (DST) for DST-FIST","grantNumber":"SR/FST/ETI-296/2011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Majority Game-based Femtocell Selection and Beam Allocation for 5G-IoT","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"YSASummaryDebPriti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066158S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560113","isNumber":"9560114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560113","xplore-issue":"9560114","articleId":"9560217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9560259,"authors":[{"name":"Anila P V","affiliation":["Mar Athanasius College of Engineering, Kothamangalam, Kerala, India-66","Cochin University of Science and Technology, Cochin, India-22"],"firstName":"Anila P","lastName":"V","id":"37088995497"},{"name":"Arya K Padman","affiliation":["Mar Athanasius College of Engineering, Kothamangalam, Kerala, India-66"],"firstName":"Arya K","lastName":"Padman","id":"37088995281"},{"name":"P Mohanan","affiliation":["Cochin University of Science and Technology, Cochin, India-22"],"firstName":"P","lastName":"Mohanan","id":"37280951700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-4639-6-8027","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2995-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-4339"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2640-7027"}],"articleNumber":"9560259","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual coupling","Bluetooth","5G mobile communication","3G mobile communication","Mobile antennas","WiMAX","Permittivity"]}],"abstract":"The article presents a compact dual-element multiband Multiple Input Multiple Output(MIMO) antenna suitable for wireless applications.

Simulation results show that the iterative receiver is robust to information aging related to phase noise.","doi":"10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560263","publicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560113/9560114/09560263.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560114","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information aging in massive MIMO systems affected by phase noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560263","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Information aging in massive MIMO systems affected by phase noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560263/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-4 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"28 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9560263/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information aging in massive MIMO systems affected by phase noise","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"URSIGASS2021SummaryPaperTemplate.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033228S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560113","isNumber":"9560114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560113","xplore-issue":"9560114","articleId":"9560263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9560264,"authors":[{"name":"Keeley Edwards","affiliation":["University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada"],"firstName":"Keeley","lastName":"Edwards","id":"37088536547"},{"name":"Vahab Khoshdel","affiliation":["University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada"],"firstName":"Vahab","lastName":"Khoshdel","id":"37086003033"},{"name":"Mohammad Asefi","affiliation":["University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Asefi","id":"37085494812"},{"name":"Joe LoVetri","affiliation":["University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada"],"firstName":"Joe","lastName":"LoVetri","id":"38510425800"},{"name":"Colin Gilmore","affiliation":["University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada"],"firstName":"Colin","lastName":"Gilmore","id":"37284285600"},{"name":"Ian Jeffrey","affiliation":["University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Jeffrey","id":"37265494900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-4639-6-8027","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2995-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-4339"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2640-7027"}],"articleNumber":"9560264","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave measurement","Geometry","Neural networks","Breast","Data models","Frequency measurement","Permittivity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560264","abstract":"A recently developed neural network architecture for recovering the radius, height, and bulk complex-valued permittivity of the fibroglandular region of a human breast model from microwave measurements is extended to multiple frequencies.

The ray-tracing simulations rely on the conventional bidirectional ray-tracing technique for collecting the information about the incident rays and corresponding wavefronts, then a stationary-phase point approximation is employed for evaluating the antenna transfer function by the reciprocity integral. Maximum-ratio combining and regularized zero-forcing precoding schemes are considered in a single cell massive MIMO scenario where a frequency of 28 GHz is assumed. Relevant comparisons are made with a carrier frequency of 7 GHz as well, where the lower frequency transmission is found beneficial in noise-limited scenarios, due to the smaller transfer function attenuation. In interference-limited scenarios, the millimeter-wave transmission performs similar to the 7 GHz carrier for a comparable base station antenna arrangement, which can, however, be considerably smaller in absolute size. Another important advantage of the millimeter-wave band is of course the larger available absolute frequency bandwidth.","doi":"10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560336","publicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560113/9560114/09560336.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560114","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigations on Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Scenarios by Bidirectional Ray-Tracing Using Stationary-Phase Point Approximation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Investigations on Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Scenarios by Bidirectional Ray-Tracing Using Stationary-Phase Point Approximation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560336/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-4 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"28 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9560336/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigations on Millimeter-Wave Massive MIMO Scenarios by Bidirectional Ray-Tracing Using Stationary-Phase Point Approximation","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"2021023599.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034827S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560113","isNumber":"9560114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560113","xplore-issue":"9560114","articleId":"9560336","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9560351,"authors":[{"name":"Seun Sangodoyin","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Seun","lastName":"Sangodoyin","id":"38484879700"},{"name":"Mine Kerpicci","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Mine","lastName":"Kerpicci","id":"37088587935"},{"name":"Chia-Lin Cheng","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Chia-Lin","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37086083973"},{"name":"Alenka Zaji\u0107","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Alenka","lastName":"Zaji\u0107","id":"37295808800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-4639-6-8027","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2995-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-4339"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2640-7027"}],"articleNumber":"9560351","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Data centers","Energy measurement","Iterative algorithms","US Department of Defense","Delays","MIMO communication"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560351","doi":"10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560351","publicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","abstract":"This paper presents a spatio-temporal analysis of discrete and diffuse multipath components (or paths) present in a propagation channel at Terahertz (THz) frequencies.

This leads to the problem of a malicious third party using a deep learning model to easily recognize the modulation format of the transmitted waveform. Some existing works address this problem directly using the concept of adversarial examples in the image domain without fully considering the characteristics of the waveform transmission in the physical world. Therefore, we propose a low-intercept waveform (LIW) generation method that can reduce the probability of the modulation being recognized by a third party without affecting the reliable communication of the friendly party. Our LIW exhibits significant low-interception performance even in the physical hardware experiment, decreasing the accuracy of the state of the art model to approximately 15% with small perturbations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Wireless communication","Perturbation methods","Modulation","Hardware","Numerical models","Reliability"]}],"doi":"10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560360","publicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560113/9560114/09560360.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Interception Waveform: To Prevent the Recognition of Spectrum Waveform Modulation via Adversarial Examples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-Interception Waveform: To Prevent the Recognition of Spectrum Waveform Modulation via Adversarial Examples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560360/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"28 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9560360/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-4 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Interception Waveform: To Prevent the Recognition of Spectrum Waveform Modulation via Adversarial Examples","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"2021022364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049097S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560113","isNumber":"9560114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560113","xplore-issue":"9560114","articleId":"9560360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9560371,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang An","affiliation":["Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"An","id":"37085520999"},{"name":"Ahmad Hoorfar","affiliation":["Antenna Research Laboratory, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Hoorfar","id":"38505574800"},{"name":"Hao Lv","affiliation":["Antenna Research Laboratory, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Lv","id":"37592318400"},{"name":"Jianqi Wang","affiliation":["Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jianqi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538987000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-4639-6-8027","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2995-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-4339"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2640-7027"}],"articleNumber":"9560371","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Radar imaging","Nonhomogeneous media","Entropy","MIMO","Topology","Gratings"]}],"abstract":"Array topology design has long been a research focus in radar imaging community, especially for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) through-the-wall radar imaging (TWRI), in which a small number of transmit and receive antenna elements are deployed in a certain fashion in aim of achieving the best possible focusing performance improvement. All prior works design the array topology in freespace, then apply the designed topology to through wall scenarios. In this paper, a wall parameters dependent array topology design strategy for TWRI is proposed. By incorporation of the transmission coefficients of the wall into the imaging model, two optimization criteria of minimum averaged grating lobes and minimum entropy of the image synthesizing operator are used to cast the problem as a two-objective optimization problem, which is then solved using the multi-objective covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. It is shown that, a less cluttered image can be achieved using this new approach for design of TWRI array topology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task-specific Sparse MIMO Array Design for TWRI using Multi-objective CMA-ES","publicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","doi":"10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560371","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560113/9560114/09560371.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560114","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","displayDocTitle":"Task-specific Sparse MIMO Array Design for TWRI using Multi-objective CMA-ES","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9560371/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","publicationDate":"28 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task-specific Sparse MIMO Array Design for TWRI using Multi-objective CMA-ES","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"URSIGASS2021SummaryHoorfar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050953S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560113","isNumber":"9560114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560113","xplore-issue":"9560114","articleId":"9560371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9560387,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael S.

The antenna topology consists of four patch antennas placed on the lateral sides of a cube. From the analysis of the array factor and the radiation pattern of the single radiating elements, the theory to realize fully steerable nulls on the azimuth plane is presented. The array, targeted for an operating frequency of 3.6 GHz, is fed by a reconfigurable radio-frequency network. The network, which bases its reconfigurability on eight phase shifters, makes it possible to excite couples of adjacent output ports with arbitrary amplitudes and phases. The radiation pattern of the topology is measured for different excitations, confirming the theory. This approach opens the way to a new beamforming approach, that can be applied to interference removal and radio localization applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560440/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"28 Aug. 2021","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-4 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9560440/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming Approach for Steerable Null Synthesis in a Four-Element Conformal Array fed with a Radio-Frequency Reconfigurable Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011688","fundingName":"Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership Joint Undertaking (ECSEL JU)","grantNumber":"H2020/2014-2020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming Approach for Steerable Null Synthesis in a Four-Element Conformal Array fed with a Radio-Frequency Reconfigurable Network","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"YSASummaryPalazziValentina.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05002S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560113","isNumber":"9560114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560113","xplore-issue":"9560114","articleId":"9560440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9560466,"authors":[{"name":"Ziyi Song","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ziyi","lastName":"Song","id":"37088994211"},{"name":"Xuejing Zhang","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xuejing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085992666"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-4639-6-8027","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2995-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-4339"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2640-7027"}],"articleNumber":"9560466","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Phase shift keying","Simulation","Modulation","Physical layer","Millimeter wave communication"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560466","doi":"10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560466","publicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","abstract":"In this paper, a simple phased-array transmission algorithm for secure millimeter-wave wireless communication is proposed.

We discuss a model for distributed beamforming and present analysis of the required ranging and angle estimation accuracy as a function of the secondary node locations and the beamforming gain using wireless frequency synchronization.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"28 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9560522/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-4 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Localization Error on Open-Loop Distributed Beamforming Arrays","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-17-1-2886"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Localization Error on Open-Loop Distributed Beamforming Arrays","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"YSASummaryMghabghabSerge.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105192S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560113","isNumber":"9560114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560113","xplore-issue":"9560114","articleId":"9560522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9560580,"authors":[{"name":"Ziyi Song","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ziyi","lastName":"Song","id":"37088994211"},{"name":"Xuejing Zhang","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xuejing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085992666"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-4639-6-8027","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2995-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2642-4339"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2640-7027"}],"articleNumber":"9560580","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560580","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shift keying","Modulation","Security","Reliability","Millimeter wave communication","Multipath channels"]}],"doi":"10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560580","publicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560113/9560114/09560580.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phased-Array Transmission for Secure mmWave Communication via Kronecker Decomposition","abstract":"This paper provides a secure communication algorithm based on Kronecker decomposition.

The simulation of the propagation channels was performed by means of ray tracing computations. The channel hardening is evaluated in two different radio wave propagation channel conditions: first, an indoor office room furnished with desks, chairs and shelters and secondly, the same room without furniture. The spatial distribution of the channel hardening is investigated in both scenarios as a function of the number of antenna elements of the array. The simulation results show that the channel hardening effect is as expected larger in the furnished room as compared with the empty room. Also as expected, the channel hardening increases with the number of antenna elements. An interesting new observation is that the channel hardening is not uniformly distributed within the coverage area. Indeed, for the considered cell-free array antenna topologies and indoor propagation scenarios the channel hardening effect becomes lesser the closer the user gets to the antenna locations and near the walls of the rooms.","doi":"10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560641","publicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 XXXIVth General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International Union of Radio Science (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560113/9560114/09560641.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/URSIGASS51995.2021.9560641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation based channel hardening of cell-free massive MIMO in mm-Wave","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560641/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation based channel hardening of cell-free massive MIMO in mm-Wave","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"28 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9560641/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-4 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation based channel hardening of cell-free massive MIMO in mm-Wave","confLoc":"Rome, Italy","sourcePdf":"2021014090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091104S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2021-Sept. 4 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560113","isNumber":"9560114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560113","xplore-issue":"9560114","articleId":"9560641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9560675,"authors":[{"name":"Maximilian Juettner","affiliation":["HTW Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Maximilian","lastName":"Juettner","id":"37088346974"},{"name":"Michael Otto","affiliation":["Globalfoundries Fab1 LLC & Co.

A new \u201cmultiple-interleaving\u201d scheme is proposed to reduce the peak current and self-compensate fixed-pattern phase noise (FPPN) with the minimal side effect of DC imbalance. To cancel out interference from the other ToF sensors, a multi-user interference cancellation (MUIC) scheme based on pseudorandom modulation is adopted. From the measurement results, we achieve a high QE of 38% at 940 nm and a high DC of 96% and 80% at 100- and 200-MHz modulation frequencies, respectively. With the superior pixel performance, the depth noise of <0.92% and <0.3% is achieved at the full and 2 \n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\times $ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n 2 binning modes, respectively. The multiple-interleaving scheme suppresses the peak current to less than 0.9 A and removes the column FPPN with constant DC for the whole pixel array. The proposed MUIC proves that at least two interferers can be successfully rejected. The sensor chip is fabricated in a two-stack process with 65 nm for the top die and 65 nm for the bottom die.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/9583614/09560706.pdf","startPage":"3209","endPage":"3219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2021.3112405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2021.3112405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9583614","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1.2-Mpixel Indirect Time-of-Flight Image Sensor With 4-Tap 3.5-<i>\u03bc</i>m Pixels for Peak Current Mitigation and Multi-User Interference Cancellation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Clocks","Demodulation","Spatial resolution","Sensor arrays","Delays","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3-D imaging","CMOS image sensor","demodulation pixel","depth sensor","time-of-flight (ToF)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"A 1.2-Mpixel Indirect Time-of-Flight Image Sensor With 4-Tap 3.5-<i>\u03bc</i>m Pixels for Peak Current Mitigation and Multi-User Interference Cancellation","volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/9560706/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1.2-Mpixel Indirect Time-of-Flight Image Sensor With 4-Tap 3.5-<italic>\u03bc</italic>m Pixels for Peak Current Mitigation and Multi-User Interference Cancellation","sourcePdf":"jssc-keel-3112405-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094249S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"9583614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","xplore-issue":"9583614","articleId":"9560706","onlineDate":"06 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9560724,"authors":[{"name":"Ragh Kuttappa","affiliation":["Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/9686552/9560724/kutta-3115037-small.gif","p":["Ragh Kuttappa (Student Member, IEEE) received the bachelor\u2019s degree from Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belgaum, India, in 2012, and the master\u2019s degree from San Francisco State University, San Francisco, CA, USA, in 2015.

The proposed DLDOs are multiphased, coined MP-DLDOs, designed with a clock-gated control technique to provide high current efficiencies along with transient response improvements at GHz frequency levels. The multiple phases within the MP-DLDO are served with ReRoCs that provide: 1) a robust high-speed low-power resonant clock distribution solution for the synchronous elements in the multiphase DLDO architecture and 2) improve the transient response characteristics [dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) speed and voltage ripple] while saving power in the controller circuitry. The proposed MP-DLDOs are distributed across the chip to achieve low voltage ripple. SPICE simulations are performed on post-layout, parasitic-extracted models to evaluate the MP-DLDO architecture on open-source digital cores, with performance metrics that include the voltage ripple reduction, transient response speed improvement, and power savings in the control logic. The proposed MP-DLDO architecture, evaluated on an RISC-V design, demonstrates a DVS speed of 6.5 V/\n<inline-formula xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mu \\text{s}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>\n and an output voltage ripple of 21.1 mV (38% reduction when compared to a conventional DLDO) with a sampling frequency of 2 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3115037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3115037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9686552","startPage":"40","endPage":"50","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9686552/09560724.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560724","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Voltage control","Regulators","Transient response","System-on-chip","Oscillators","Circuit topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital low-dropout~(DLDO)","low power","resonant rotary clock (ReRoC)","voltage regulators (VRs)","VLSI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiphase Digital Low-Dropout Regulators","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9560724/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560724/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1816857 and 2008629"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiphase Digital Low-Dropout Regulators","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-kuttappa-3115037-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114919S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9686552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9686552","articleId":"9560724","onlineDate":"06 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9560763,"authors":[{"name":"Rehman S.

Occupancy grids discretize the analog environment and seek to determine the occupancy probability of each cell. More recent occupancy grid mapping algorithms have shown the advantage of capturing cell correlations in the measurement model and the posterior. By estimating the probability of a given map as opposed to a cell, these algorithms have been able to better capture the occupancy probability of cells in the map. The advantage of incorporating data-driven prior probabilities in occupancy grid mapping is explored. A form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) known as Gibbs sampling allows us to sample maps from the full posterior. Previous research has sampled the occupancy probability of each cell, but this paper extends that work to sample a larger patch of cells and highlights the benefit of obtaining the prior for each patch from real maps.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Correlation","Automation","Conferences","Markov processes","Mobile robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","Markov processes","mobile robots","Monte Carlo methods","probability","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MCMC occupancy grid mapping","data-driven patch","occupancy grids","occupancy probability","recent occupancy grid mapping algorithms","cell correlations","given map","data-driven prior probabilities","sample maps"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560763","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09560763.pdf","startPage":"5988","endPage":"5995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MCMC Occupancy Grid Mapping with a Data-Driven Patch Prior","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MCMC Occupancy Grid Mapping with a Data-Driven Patch Prior","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560763/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"30 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9560763/","accessionNumber":"21257501","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MCMC Occupancy Grid Mapping with a Data-Driven Patch Prior","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082964S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9560763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9560784,"authors":[{"name":"Piyush Khandelwal","affiliation":["Sony AI, Sony Corporation of America, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Piyush","lastName":"Khandelwal","id":"38490919800"},{"name":"James MacGlashan","affiliation":["Sony AI, Sony Corporation of America, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"MacGlashan","id":"37085510936"},{"name":"Peter Wurman","affiliation":["Sony AI, Sony Corporation of America, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Wurman","id":"37088997021"},{"name":"Peter Stone","affiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Stone","id":"37269574900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9560784","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automation","Convolution","Conferences","Memory management","Network architecture","Real-time systems","Inference algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560784","abstract":"It has been recently demonstrated that Temporal Convolution Networks (TCNs) provide state-of-the-art results in many problem domains where the input data is a time-series.

Real-time inference using a trained TCN can be challenging on devices with limited compute and memory, especially if the receptive field is large. This paper introduces the RT-TCN algorithm that reuses the output of prior convolution operations to minimize the computational requirements and persistent memory footprint of a TCN during real-time inference. We also show that when a TCN is trained using time slices of the input time-series, it can be executed in realtime continually using RT-TCN. In addition, we provide TCN architecture guidelines that ensure that real-time inference can be performed within memory and computational constraints.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560784","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09560784.pdf","startPage":"13489","endPage":"13495","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Real-Time Inference in Temporal Convolution Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Real-Time Inference in Temporal Convolution Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9560784/","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Real-Time Inference in Temporal Convolution Networks","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06726S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9560784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":9560792,"authors":[{"name":"Xingxing Zuo","affiliation":["ETH Z\u00fcrich","Institute of Cyber-System and Control, Zhejiang University"],"firstName":"Xingxing","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37086314032"},{"name":"Nathaniel Merrill","affiliation":["Robot Perception and Navigation Group, University of Delaware"],"firstName":"Nathaniel","lastName":"Merrill","id":"37087322112"},{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["Inceptio Technology, Shanghi, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Li","id":"37089000271"},{"name":"Yong Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Cyber-System and Control, Zhejiang University"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37066946100"},{"name":"Marc Pollefeys","affiliation":["ETH Z\u00fcrich","Microsoft Mixed Reality and Artificial Intelligence Lab, Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Pollefeys","id":"37271138500"},{"name":"Guoquan Huang","affiliation":["Robot Perception and Navigation Group, University of Delaware"],"firstName":"Guoquan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37077670600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9560792","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jacobian matrices","Geometry","Codes","Automation","Navigation","Conferences","Pose estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560792","abstract":"In this work, we present a lightweight, tightly-coupled deep depth network and visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system, which can provide accurate state estimates and dense depth maps of the immediate surroundings.

The compact representation of dense depth, termed depth code, can be updated jointly with navigation states in a sliding window estimator in order to provide the dense local scene geometry. We additionally propose a novel method to obtain the CVAE\u2019s Jacobian which is shown to be more than an order of magnitude faster than previous works, and we additionally leverage First-Estimate Jacobian (FEJ) to avoid recalculation.

The initial guess passed to the optimizer affects the computation needed to achieve convergence and the quality of the solution. We consider two methods for generating good guesses. The first is a heuristic initializer which provides a simple guess and requires significant optimization but is nonetheless suitable for adaptation to upcoming terrain. We demonstrate experiments using the ANYmal C quadruped, with fully onboard sensing and computation, to cross obstacles at moderate speeds using this technique.

At present, progress in this field is hindered by the fact that each facial expression needs to be programmed by humans. In order to adapt robot behavior in real time to different situations that arise when interacting with human subjects, robots need to be able to train themselves without requiring human labels, as well as make fast action decisions and generalize the acquired knowledge to diverse and new contexts. We addressed this challenge by designing a physical animatronic robotic face with soft skin and by developing a vision-based self-supervised learning framework for facial mimicry.

Our method successively learns an agnostic foreground segmentation followed by a distinction between manipulator and object solely by observing the motion between consecutive RGB frames. In contrast to previous approaches, we propose a single, end-to-end trainable architecture which jointly incorporates motion cues and semantic knowledge. Furthermore, while the motion of the manipulator and the object are substantial cues for our algorithm, we present means to robustly deal with distraction objects moving in the background, as well as with completely static scenes. Our method neither depends on any visual registration of a kinematic robot or 3D object models, nor on precise hand-eye calibration or any additional sensor data. By extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate the superiority of our framework and provide detailed insights on its capability of dealing with the aforementioned extreme cases of motion. We also show that training a semantic segmentation network with the automatically labeled data achieves results on par with manually annotated training data.

Thus, ensuring their safe flight in areas containing people is a top priority. In this paper, a deep neural network-based method is proposed for the task of visual human crowd detection from UAV footage, allowing a drone to rapidly extract semantic segmentation maps from captured video frames during flight. These maps can be exploited (e.g., by a path planner) to define no-fly zones over, or near human crowds and, hence, enhance UAV flight safety. To this end, a novel neural architecture for binary (crowd/non- crowd) semantic segmentation from single RGB images is proposed, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It consists of a semantic segmentation and an image-to-image translation (I2I) neural branch. The overall network is trained using a novel multi-task loss function that addresses both tasks by processing the output of the corresponding branch. During inference, information flows across branches through additional skip synapses to further assist the crowd detection task. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we introduce a real and a synthetic human crowd RGB image dataset. The proposed method outperforms previous aerial crowd detection methods by a large margin and without any post-processing. Moreover, it demonstrates increased generalization ability, while running at real-time and near-real-time speeds on a ground computer and on embedded AI hardware, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560830/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9560830/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Autonomous UAV Safety by Visual Human Crowd Detection Using Multi-Task Deep Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous UAV Safety by Visual Human Crowd Detection Using Multi-Task Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0755.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137325S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9560830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":9560858,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["University of Oxford, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086943823"},{"name":"Pedro P.

Although there are learning-based approaches that operate scene-agnostically, the generalization capability of these methods is still outperformed by classical approaches. In this paper, we present an approach that can generalize to new scenes by applying specific changes to the model architecture, including an extended regression part, the use of hierarchical correlation layers, and the exploitation of scale and uncertainty information. Our approach outperforms the 5-point algorithm using SIFT features on equally big images and additionally surpasses all previous learning-based approaches that were trained on different data. It is also superior to most of the approaches that were specifically trained on the respective scenes. We also evaluate our approach in a scenario with only very few reference images, showing that under such more realistic conditions our learning-based approach considerably exceeds both existing learning-based and classical methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560872","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560872","startPage":"5840","endPage":"5846","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09560872.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Localize in New Environments from Synthetic Training Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Localize in New Environments from Synthetic Training Data","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9560872/","accessionNumber":"21257416","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560872/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Localize in New Environments from Synthetic Training Data","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104536S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9560872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9560879,"authors":[{"name":"Trevor Phillips","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Phillips","id":"37089002077"},{"name":"Maximilian St\u00f6lzle","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Maximilian","lastName":"St\u00f6lzle","id":"37089000305"},{"name":"Erick Turricelli","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Erick","lastName":"Turricelli","id":"37089002063"},{"name":"Florian Achermann","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Achermann","id":"37086866506"},{"name":"Nicholas Lawrance","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Lawrance","id":"37571923900"},{"name":"Roland Siegwart","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Siegwart","id":"37281398300"},{"name":"Jen Jen Chung","affiliation":["Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jen Jen","lastName":"Chung","id":"37085668354"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9560879","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Airplanes","Solid modeling","Costs","Three-dimensional displays","Neural networks","Estimation","Nearest neighbor methods"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560879","abstract":"For asymptotically optimal sampling-based path planners such as RRT*, path quality improves as the number of samples added to the motion tree increases.

Calculating state transition costs can be particularly difficult in cases with complex dynamics such as aerial vehicles in non-isotropic cost fields like wind. Computationally costly nearest neighbor searches increase the time required to add new samples to the search tree, thereby reducing the likelihood of finding low-cost paths in a given computational time. In this paper, we propose the use of a lightweight neural network to approximate nearest neighbor cost calculations. The network approach uses a low-dimensional encoding of the cost space along with a start and goal query pair and returns an estimate of the path cost that can be used for nearest neighbor and path validity estimation.

Event-based cameras produce a sparse stream of events that can be processed more efficiently and with a lower latency than images, enabling ultra-fast vision-driven control. Here, we explore how an event-based vision algorithm can be implemented as a spiking neuronal network on a neuromorphic chip and used in a drone controller. We show how seamless integration of event-based perception on chip leads to even faster control rates and lower latency. In addition, we demonstrate how online adaptation of the SNN controller can be realised using on-chip learning. Our spiking neuronal network on chip is the first example of a neuromorphic vision-based controller on chip solving a high-speed UAV control task. The excellent scalability of processing in neuromorphic hardware opens the possibility to solve more challenging visual tasks in the future and integrate visual perception in fast control loops.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560881","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09560881.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560881","startPage":"103","endPage":"109","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Event-driven Vision and Control for UAVs on a Neuromorphic Chip","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9560881/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-driven Vision and Control for UAVs on a Neuromorphic Chip","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07812S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9560881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":9560889,"authors":[{"name":"Raphael Grimm","affiliation":["Institute for Anthropomatics and Robotics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Grimm","id":"37085813662"},{"name":"Markus Grotz","affiliation":["Institute for Anthropomatics and Robotics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Grotz","id":"37086200970"},{"name":"Simon Ottenhaus","affiliation":["Institute for Anthropomatics and Robotics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Ottenhaus","id":"37086037643"},{"name":"Tamim Asfour","affiliation":["Institute for Anthropomatics and Robotics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Tamim","lastName":"Asfour","id":"37295529100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9560889","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"abstract":"Increasing the robustness of grasping actions and the recovery from failure is key to improving a robot\u2019s autonomy.

First, we train an attention network that estimates the importance of neighboring pedestrians, using gaze data collected as subjects perform a bird\u2019s eye view crowd navigation task. Then, we incorporate the learned attention weights modulated by constraints on the pedestrian\u2019s visual field into a trajectory prediction network that uses a GCN to aggregate information from neighbors efficiently. AVGCN also considers the stochastic nature of pedestrian trajectories by taking advantage of variational trajectory prediction. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several trajectory prediction benchmarks, and the lowest average prediction error over all considered benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560908","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09560908.pdf","startPage":"14234","endPage":"14240","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AVGCN: Trajectory Prediction using Graph Convolutional Networks Guided by Human Attention","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560908/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"AVGCN: Trajectory Prediction using Graph Convolutional Networks Guided by Human Attention","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9560908/","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AVGCN: Trajectory Prediction using Graph Convolutional Networks Guided by Human Attention","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071043S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9560908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9560910,"authors":[{"name":"Namita Anil Kumar","affiliation":["Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Namita Anil","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37086047809"},{"name":"Woolim Hong","affiliation":["Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Woolim","lastName":"Hong","id":"37086200267"},{"name":"Pilwon Hur","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea","Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Pilwon","lastName":"Hur","id":"38317004800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9560910","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Knee","Damping","Trajectory tracking","Market research","Impedance","Tuning"]}],"abstract":"The design of impedance controllers for sloped walking with a transfemoral prosthesis is a complex control problem that generally results in numerous tuning parameters.

The diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is considered an effective means to prevent Alzheimer's disease (AD). Doctors diagnose MCI based on various clinical examinations, which are expensive and the diagnosis results rely on the knowledge of doctors. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a robot diagnostic system to eliminate the influence of human factors and obtain a higher accuracy rate. In this paper, we propose a novel Group Feature Domain Adversarial Neural Network (GF- DANN) for amnestic MCI (aMCI) diagnosis, which involves two important modules. A Group Feature Extraction (GFE) module is proposed to reduce individual differences by learning group- level features through adversarial learning. A Dual Branch Domain Adaptation (DBDA) module is carefully designed to reduce the distribution difference between the source and target domain in a domain adaption way. On three types of data set, GF-DANN achieves the best accuracy compared with classic machine learning and deep learning methods. On the DMS data set, GF-DANN has obtained an accuracy rate of 89.47%, and the sensitivity and specificity are 90% and 89%. In addition, by comparing three EEG data collection paradigms, our results demonstrate that the DMS paradigm has the potential to build an aMCI diagnose robot system.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560928","startPage":"9340","endPage":"9346","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09560928.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group Feature Learning and Domain Adversarial Neural Network for aMCI Diagnosis System Based on EEG","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560928/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Group Feature Learning and Domain Adversarial Neural Network for aMCI Diagnosis System Based on EEG","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9560928/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012492","fundingName":"Youth Innovation Promotion Association"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group Feature Learning and Domain Adversarial Neural Network for aMCI Diagnosis System Based on EEG","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129295S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9560928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9560935,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Heiden","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Heiden","id":"37990849700"},{"name":"David Millard","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Millard","id":"37088996818"},{"name":"Erwin Coumans","affiliation":["Robotics at Google, Mountain View, USA"],"firstName":"Erwin","lastName":"Coumans","id":"37086455409"},{"name":"Yizhou Sheng","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, USA"],"firstName":"Yizhou","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37088999458"},{"name":"Gaurav S.

Nonetheless, these analytical models can only predict the dynamical behavior of systems for which they have been designed. In this work, we study the augmentation of a novel differentiable rigid-body physics engine via neural networks that is able to learn nonlinear relationships between dynamic quantities and can thus model effects not accounted for in traditional simulators. Such augmentations require less data to train and generalize better compared to entirely data-driven models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the ability of our hybrid simulator to learn complex dynamics involving frictional contacts from real data, as well as match known models of viscous friction, and present an approach for automatically discovering useful augmentations. We show that, besides benefiting dynamics modeling, inserting neural networks can accelerate model-based control architectures.

Sampling-based motion planning algorithms find solutions by approximating the robot\u2019s configuration space through a graph representation, predicting or computing obstacles\u2019 trajectories, and finding feasible paths via a pathfinding algorithm. In this work, we seek to improve the performance of these subproblems by identifying regions critical to dynamic environment navigation and leveraging them to construct sparse probabilistic roadmaps. Motion planning and pathfinding algorithms should allow robots to prevent encounters with obstacles, irrespective of their trajectories, by being conscious of spatial context cues such as the location of chokepoints (e.g., doorways). Thus, we propose a self-supervised methodology for learning to identify regions frequently used for obstacle avoidance from local environment features. As an application of this concept, we leverage a neural network to generate hierarchical probabilistic roadmaps termed Avoidance Critical Probabilistic Roadmaps (ACPRM). These roadmaps contain motion structures that enable efficient obstacle avoidance, reduce the search and planning space, and increase a roadmap\u2019s reusability and coverage. ACPRMs are demonstrated to achieve up to five orders of magnitude improvement over grid-sampling in the multi-agent setting and up to ten orders of magnitude over a competitive baseline in the multi-query setting.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Avoidance Critical Probabilistic Roadmaps for Motion Planning in Dynamic Environments","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560974","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09560974.pdf","startPage":"10264","endPage":"10270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9560974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9560974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9560974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Avoidance Critical Probabilistic Roadmaps for Motion Planning in Dynamic Environments","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9560974/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Avoidance Critical Probabilistic Roadmaps for Motion Planning in Dynamic Environments","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2836.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077369S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9560974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9560978,"authors":[{"name":"Joaquim Ortiz-Haro","affiliation":["Machine Learning & Robotics Lab, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Joaquim","lastName":"Ortiz-Haro","id":"37088998356"},{"name":"Valentin N.

We consider the case where a problem is factored, that is, the underlying nonlinear program is decomposed into differentiable equality and inequality constraints, each of which depends only on some variables. Such problems are at the core of efficient and robust sequential robot manipulation planning. Naive sequential conditional sampling of individual variables, as well as fully joint sampling of all variables at once (e.g., leveraging optimization methods), can be highly inefficient and non-robust. We propose a novel framework to learn how to break the overall problem into smaller sequential sampling problems. Specifically, we leverage Monte-Carlo Tree Search to learn assignment orders for the variable-subsets, in order to minimize the computation time to generate feasible full samples. This strategy allows us to efficiently compute a set of diverse valid robot configurations for mode-switches within sequential manipulation tasks, which are waypoints for subsequent trajectory optimization or sampling-based motion planning algorithms. We show that the learning method quickly converges to the best sampling strategy for a given problem, and outperforms user-defined orderings or fully joint optimization, while providing a higher sample diversity.

We develop the first finite-sample analysis of this kind, which specifies the number of samples, their deterministic distribution, and magnitude of the connection radii that should be used by each individual PRM graph, to guarantee near-optimality using the TR. This significantly improves upon a previous asymptotic analysis, wherein the number of samples tends to infinity. Our new finite sample-size analysis supports guaranteed high- quality solutions in practice within finite time. To achieve our new result, we first develop a sampling scheme, which we call the staggered grid, for finite-sample motion planning for individual robots, which requires significantly less samples than previous work. We then extend it to the much more involved MRMP setting which requires to account for interactions among multiple robots. Finally, we report on a few experiments that serve as a verification of our theoretical findings and raise interesting questions for further investigation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensors","Automation","Conferences","Planning","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","path planning","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal multirobot motion planning","sampling-based methods","continuous multirobot motion planning","tensor roadmap","multiple PRM graphs","tensor product","near-optimal solution","MRMP-satisfying","popular planners","continuous domain","finite-sample analysis","individual PRM graph","near-optimality","previous asymptotic analysis","finite sample-size analysis","quality solutions","sampling scheme","finite-sample motion planning","involved MRMP setting","multiple robots"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561009","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561009.pdf","startPage":"9190","endPage":"9196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Optimal Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Finite Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561009","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Near-Optimal Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Finite Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561009/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"30 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9561009/","accessionNumber":"21257432","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100015599","fundingName":"Toyota Research Institute"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Optimal Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Finite Sampling","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0773S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9561071,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Killing","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich","The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Killing","id":"37088999745"},{"name":"Adam Villaflor","affiliation":["The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Villaflor","id":"37086454225"},{"name":"John M.

However, most of these successes have been limited to scenarios with well-defined traffic rules and require minimal negotiation with other vehicles. In this paper, we introduce a previously unconsidered, yet everyday, high-conflict driving scenario requiring negotiations between agents of equal rights and priorities. There exists no centralized control structure and we do not allow communications. Therefore, it is unknown if other drivers are willing to cooperate, and if so to what extent. We train policies to robustly negotiate with opposing vehicles of an unobservable degree of cooperativeness using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We propose Discrete Asymmetric Soft Actor-Critic (DASAC), a maximum- entropy off-policy MARL algorithm allowing for centralized training with decentralized execution. We show that using DASAC we are able to successfully negotiate and traverse the scenario considered over 99% of the time. Our agents are robust to an unknown timing of opponent decisions, an unobservable degree of cooperativeness of the opposing vehicle, and previously unencountered policies. Furthermore, they learn to exhibit human-like behaviors such as defensive driving, anticipating solution options and interpreting the behavior of other agents.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561071","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561071.pdf","startPage":"8090","endPage":"8096","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Robustly Negotiate Bi-Directional Lane Usage in High-Conflict Driving Scenarios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Robustly Negotiate Bi-Directional Lane Usage in High-Conflict Driving Scenarios","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9561071/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","accessionNumber":"21256781","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561071/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Robustly Negotiate Bi-Directional Lane Usage in High-Conflict Driving Scenarios","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124822S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9561104,"authors":[{"name":"Constantinos Chamzas","affiliation":["Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Constantinos","lastName":"Chamzas","id":"37086933748"},{"name":"Zachary Kingston","affiliation":["Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Zachary","lastName":"Kingston","id":"37085542480"},{"name":"Carlos Quintero-Pe\u00f1a","affiliation":["Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Quintero-Pe\u00f1a","id":"37088997672"},{"name":"Anshumali Shrivastava","affiliation":["Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Anshumali","lastName":"Shrivastava","id":"37085998758"},{"name":"Lydia E.

In this work, we propose a new instance of joint MOT approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The key idea is that GNNs can model relations between variablesized objects in both the spatial and temporal domains, which is essential for learning discriminative features for detection and data association. Through extensive experiments on the MOT15/16/17/20 datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our GNN-based joint MOT approach and show state-of-the-art performance for both detection and MOT tasks.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561110","startPage":"13708","endPage":"13715","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561110.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Object Detection and Multi-Object Tracking with Graph Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Automation","Conferences","Object detection","Feature extraction","Graph neural networks","Data models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Joint Object Detection and Multi-Object Tracking with Graph Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9561110/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Object Detection and Multi-Object Tracking with Graph Neural Networks","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.236986S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9561136,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew Price","affiliation":["the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Price","id":"37088997419"},{"name":"Kun Huang","affiliation":["the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37088999616"},{"name":"Dmitry Berenson","affiliation":["the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Dmitry","lastName":"Berenson","id":"37542925700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561136","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561136","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Technological innovation","Three-dimensional displays","Uncertainty","Tracking","Shape","Motion segmentation"]}],"abstract":"Despite rapid progress in scene segmentation in recent years, 3D segmentation methods are still limited when there is severe occlusion. The key challenge is estimating the segment boundaries of (partially) occluded objects, which are inherently ambiguous when considering only a single frame. In this work, we propose Multihypothesis Segmentation Tracking (MST), a novel method for volumetric segmentation in changing scenes, which allows scene ambiguity to be tracked and our estimates to be adjusted over time as we interact with the scene. Two main innovations allow us to tackle this difficult problem: 1) A novel way to sample possible segmentations from a segmentation tree; and 2) A novel approach to fusing tracking results with multiple segmentation estimates. These methods allow MST to track the segmentation state over time and incorporate new information, such as new objects being revealed. We evaluate our method on several cluttered tabletop environments in simulation and reality. Our results show that MST outperforms baselines in all tested scenes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561136","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561136.pdf","startPage":"9572","endPage":"9578","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusing RGBD Tracking and Segmentation Tree Sampling for Multi-Hypothesis Volumetric Segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Fusing RGBD Tracking and Segmentation Tree Sampling for Multi-Hypothesis Volumetric Segmentation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9561136/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561136/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusing RGBD Tracking and Segmentation Tree Sampling for Multi-Hypothesis Volumetric Segmentation","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079414S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561136","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9561158,"authors":[{"name":"Takeda Koji","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Fukui, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeda","lastName":"Koji","id":"37086886630"},{"name":"Tanaka Kanji","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Fukui, Japan"],"firstName":"Tanaka","lastName":"Kanji","id":"37845876800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561158","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561158","abstract":"In visual robot self-localization, graph-based scene representation and matching have recently attracted research interest as robust and discriminative methods for self-localization. Although effective, their computational and storage costs do not scale well to large-size environments. To alleviate this problem, we formulate self-localization as a graph classification problem and attempt to use the graph convolutional neural network (GCN) as a graph classification engine. A straightforward approach is to use visual feature descriptors that are employed by state-of-the-art self-localization systems, directly as graph node features. However, their superior performance in the original self-localization system may not necessarily be replicated in GCN-based self-localization. To address this issue, we introduce a novel teacher-to-student knowledge-transfer scheme based on rank matching, in which the reciprocal-rank vector output by an off-the-shelf state-of-the-art teacher self-localization model is used as the dark knowledge to transfer. Experiments indicate that the proposed graph-convolutional self-localization network (GCLN) can significantly outperform state-of-the-art self-localization systems, as well as the teacher classifier.

While this design has been successfully applied on a number of applications, it is not of theoretical performance guarantee unless patterned motion is involved. This inevitably leads to significantly reduced accuracy and robustness in certain use cases. To solve this problem, we design a framework to compute observable IMU integration terms using DNNs, followed by the numerical pose integration and sensor fusion to achieve the performance gain. Specifically, we perform detailed analysis on the motion terms in IMU kinematic equations, propose a dedicated network design, loss functions, and training strategies for the IMU data processing, and conduct extensive experiments.

This is time-consuming and difficult for human programmers, particularly for force-controlled skills. To this end, we present Shadow Program Inversion (SPI), a novel approach to infer optimal skill parameters directly from data. SPI leverages unsupervised learning to train an auxiliary differentiable program representation (\"shadow program\") and realizes parameter inference via gradient-based model inversion. Our method enables the use of efficient first-order optimizers to infer optimal parameters for originally non-differentiable skills, including many skill variants currently used in production. SPI zero-shot generalizes across task objectives, meaning that shadow programs do not need to be retrained to infer parameters for different task variants.

Reasoning and planning collision-free trajectories on the additional degrees of freedom of several fingers represents an important challenge that, so far, involves computationally costly and slow processes. In this work, we present Multi-FinGAN, a fast generative multi-finger grasp sampling method that synthesizes high quality grasps directly from RGB-D images in about a second. We achieve this by training in an end-to-end fashion a coarse-to-fine model composed of a classification network that distinguishes grasp types according to a specific taxonomy and a refinement network that produces refined grasp poses and joint angles. We experimentally validate and benchmark our method against a standard grasp-sampling method on 790 grasps in simulation and 20 grasps on a real Franka Emika Panda. All experimental results using our method show consistent improvements both in terms of grasp quality metrics and grasp success rate. Remarkably, our approach is up to 20-30 times faster than the baseline, a significant improvement that opens the door to feedback-based grasp re-planning and task informative grasping.

This paper describes a method using an instrumented dart deployed and retrieved by a drone for performing core sample tests in soft soils. The instrumented dart can simultaneously conduct free- fall penetrometer tests. A drone-mounted mechanism enables deploying and reeling in the dart for sample return or for multiple soil strength tests. Tests examine the effect of dart tip diameter and drop height on soil retrieval, and the requisite pull force to retrieve the samples. Further tests examine the dart\u2019s ability to measure soil strength and penetration depth. Hardware trials demonstrate that the drone can repeatedly drop and retrieve a dart, and that the soil can be discretely sampled.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature measurement","Soil measurements","Instruments","Sea measurements","Soil","Pollution measurement","Ocean temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["contamination","geotechnical engineering","soil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wetland soil strength tester","core sampler","soil strength testing","collecting soil cores","slow process","disturbing soil samples","contaminating soil samples","instrumented dart","core sample tests","soft soils","penetrometer tests","drone-mounted mechanism","sample return","multiple soil strength tests","dart tip diameter","drop height","soil retrieval","penetration depth"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561234","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561234.pdf","startPage":"2106","endPage":"2112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561234","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wetland Soil Strength Tester and Core Sampler Using a Drone","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wetland Soil Strength Tester and Core Sampler Using a Drone","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561234/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"30 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9561234/","accessionNumber":"21256804","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wetland Soil Strength Tester and Core Sampler Using a Drone","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1984.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068091S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9561246,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Prado","affiliation":["Robotics and Rehabilitation Laboratory, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Prado","id":"37086063498"},{"name":"Haohan Zhang","affiliation":["Robotics and Rehabilitation Laboratory, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Haohan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086027856"},{"name":"Sunil K.

Light-weight designs are desirable for human usage and parallel robots are quite suitable due to low moving inertia. One of the challenges of using wearable parallel robots is to compute the end-effector position/orientation from joint angle measurements, as the forward kinematics problem is computationally difficult. It becomes even more challenging if the kinematic model changes from the nominal model due to deflection of the mechanical members, manufacturing tolerances, or misalignments of the joints between the machine and the user.Artificial neural networks have been used to provide solution of the forward kinematics problem for parallel robots. However, their efficacy has not yet been studied in wearable applications where the linkages of the robots are not fully rigid. In this paper, we conducted a case study to investigate the performance of using neural network models to compute forward kinematics of a wearable robot. Our results show that the performance of neural networks is superior to numerical approaches and produces reasonable solutions even at the boundary of the robot workspace.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561246","startPage":"14524","endPage":"14530","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561246.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Networks to Solve Forward Kinematics of a Wearable Parallel Robot with Semi-rigid Links","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Parallel robots","Tensors","Computational modeling","Wearable computers","Kinematics","Artificial neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Networks to Solve Forward Kinematics of a Wearable Parallel Robot with Semi-rigid Links","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9561246/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Networks to Solve Forward Kinematics of a Wearable Parallel Robot with Semi-rigid Links","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"3934.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105477S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9561249,"authors":[{"name":"Jingpei Lu","affiliation":["University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jingpei","lastName":"Lu","id":"37088071646"},{"name":"Ambareesh Jayakumari","affiliation":["University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ambareesh","lastName":"Jayakumari","id":"37088997973"},{"name":"Florian Richter","affiliation":["University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Richter","id":"37086936752"},{"name":"Yang Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37088997034"},{"name":"Michael C.

One key aspect is to estimate the sea state in a real-time manner. Considering the ship as a large wave buoy, the sea state can be estimated from motion responses without extra sensors installed. However, it is difficult to associate waves with ship motion through an explicit model since the hydrodynamic effect is hard to model. In this paper, a data-driven model is developed to estimate the sea state based on ship motion data. The ship motion response is analyzed through statistical, temporal, spectral, and wavelet analysis. Features from multi-domain are constructed and an ensemble machine learning model is established. Real-world data is collected from a research vessel operating on the west coast of Norway. Through the validation with the real-world data, the model shows promising performance in terms of significant wave height and peak period.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Uncertainty","Estimation","Sea state","Feature extraction","Wavelet analysis","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydrodynamics","learning (artificial intelligence)","ocean waves","oceanographic techniques","ships"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven sea state estimation","multidomain features","motion responses","situation awareness","autonomous ships","wave buoy","explicit model","data-driven model","ship motion data","ship motion response","ensemble machine learning model","real-world data"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561261","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561261.pdf","startPage":"2120","endPage":"2126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven sea state estimation for vessels using multi-domain features from motion responses","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven sea state estimation for vessels using multi-domain features from motion responses","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561261/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"30 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9561261/","accessionNumber":"21257593","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven sea state estimation for vessels using multi-domain features from motion responses","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080686S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9561290,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Bisulco","affiliation":["Samsung AI Center NY, New York, New York"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Bisulco","id":"37085794585"},{"name":"Fernando Cladera Ojeda","affiliation":["Samsung AI Center NY, New York, New York"],"firstName":"Fernando Cladera","lastName":"Ojeda","id":"37088750171"},{"name":"Volkan Isler","affiliation":["Samsung AI Center NY, New York, New York"],"firstName":"Volkan","lastName":"Isler","id":"37298487800"},{"name":"Daniel D.

As a representative scenario we consider a robot at rest, reacting to a small, fast approaching object at speeds higher than 15 m/s. Since conventional image sensors at typical frame rates observe such an object for only a few frames, estimating the underlying motion presents a considerable challenge for standard computer vision systems and algorithms. We present a method motivated by how animals such as insects solve this problem with their relatively simple vision systems.Our solution takes the event stream from a DVS and first encodes the temporal events with a set of causal exponential filters across multiple time scales. We couple these filters with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to efficiently extract relevant spatiotemporal features. The combined network learns to output both the expected time to collision of the object, as well as the predicted collision point on a discretized polar grid. These critical estimates are computed with minimal delay by the network in order to react appropriately to the incoming object.

As a first contribution, we propose to augment the vertex representations with important local geometric information of the points, followed by nonlinear projection using a MLP. As a second contribution, we propose to improve the graph construction for GNNs for 3D point clouds. The existing methods work with a k-NN based approach for constructing the local neighborhood graph. We argue that it might lead to reduction in coverage in case of dense sampling by sensors in some regions of the scene. The proposed methods aims to counter such problems and improve coverage in such cases. As the traditional GNNs were designed to work with general graphs, where vertices may have no geometric interpretations, we see both our proposals as augmenting the general graphs to incorporate the geometric nature of 3D point clouds. While being simple, we demonstrate with multiple challenging benchmarks, with relatively clean CAD models, as well as with real world noisy scans, that the proposed method achieves state of the art results on benchmarks for 3D classification (ModelNet40) , part segmentation (ShapeNet) and semantic segmentation (Stanford 3D Indoor Scenes Dataset).

Following our previous work where we proposed a freeform MSRR module called FreeBOT, this paper presents a novel configuration detection system for FreeBOT using a magnetic sensor array. A FreeBOT module can be connected by up to 11 modules, and the proposed configuration detection system can locate a variable number of connection points accurately in real-time. By equipping FreeBOT with 24 magnetic sensors, the magnetic field density produced by magnets and steel spherical shells can be monitored. The connectable area is split into 199 non-uniform regions, including 84 uniform regions. Using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based algorithm, the connection points can be located accurately under ferromagnetic environments. The system can locate a variable number of connection points for such a region division with only single connection point training data. Finally, the localization algorithm can run faster than 40 Hz on FreeBOT.

In particular, this work focuses on estimating the forward reachable set of closed-loop systems with NN controllers. Recent work provides bounds on these reachable sets, yet the computationally efficient approaches provide overly conservative bounds (thus cannot be used to verify useful properties), whereas tighter methods are too intensive for online computation. This work bridges the gap by formulating a convex optimization problem for reachability analysis for closed-loop systems with NN controllers. While the solutions are less tight than prior semidefinite program-based methods, they are substantially faster to compute, and some of the available computation time can be used to refine the bounds through input set partitioning, which more than overcomes the tightness gap. The proposed framework further considers systems with measurement and process noise, thus being applicable to realistic systems with uncertainty. Finally, numerical comparisons show that our approach based on linear programming and partitioning can give 10\u00d7 reduction in conservatism in $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the computation time compared to the state-of-the-art, and the ability to handle various sources of uncertainty is highlighted on a quadrotor model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561348/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9561348/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Reachability Analysis of Closed-Loop Systems with Neural Network Controllers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Reachability Analysis of Closed-Loop Systems with Neural Network Controllers","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110391S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":9561358,"authors":[{"name":"Younghwa Jung","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Younghwa","lastName":"Jung","id":"37088477860"},{"name":"Mingu Jeon","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mingu","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37088997960"},{"name":"Chan Kim","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37089001231"},{"name":"Seung-Woo Seo","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Woo","lastName":"Seo","id":"37271925900"},{"name":"Seong-Woo Kim","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Woo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37537386000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561358","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Uncertainty","Three-dimensional displays","Urban areas","Benchmark testing","Feature extraction","Safety"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561358","abstract":"Curb detection is an essential function of autonomous vehicles in urban areas. However, curbs are difficult to detect in complex urban environments in which many dynamic objects exist. Additionally, curbs appear in a variety of shapes and sizes. Previous studies have been based on the traditional pipeline, which consists of the extraction and aggregation of hand-crafted features that are then fed to classifiers. However, this sequential process is inefficient and designing the hand-crafted features is a complex process. Recently, this kind of process has been replaced by Deep Neural Networks (DNN), in which classifiers and features are learned from large-scale data. Very few works have exploited DNN for the curb detection problem. Most works use multi-modal sensor-based methods that combine images and accumulated 3D point clouds from LIDAR. However, these approaches require synchronization and calibration between sensors. In addition, they do not quantify the uncertainty of their predictions for autonomous system safety. In this paper, we present a two-stage DNN-based curb detection method that includes uncertainty quantification. An autoencoder-based network predicts the curbs, and then conditional neural processes rectify the predictions with uncertainty estimations. The experimental results show that our approach achieves high accuracy and recall in complex areas. We also constructed a large-scale dataset to create benchmarks consisting of approximately 5,224 scans with bird\u2019s-eye view labels collected from urban areas.

However, this requirement is very challenging as the environment changes continuously and indefinitely, leading to appearance changes of interest points with respect to time. This paper proposes to predict the repeatability of an interest point as a function of time, which can tell us the lifespan of the interest point considering daily or seasonal variation. The repeatability predictor (RP) is formulated as a regressor trained on repeated interest points from multiple viewpoints over a long period of time. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our RP can estimate when a new interest point is repeated, and also highlight an insightful analysis about this problem. For further comparison, we apply our RP to the map summarization under visual localization framework, which builds a compact representation of the full context map given the query time. The experimental result shows a careful selection of potentially repeatable interest points predicted by our RP can significantly mitigate the degeneration of localization accuracy from map summarization.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561383","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561383.pdf","startPage":"10294","endPage":"10301","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Predict Repeatability of Interest Points","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Predict Repeatability of Interest Points","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9561383/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561383/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Predict Repeatability of Interest Points","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1921.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.152225S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9561391,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Seita","affiliation":["Autolab at the University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Seita","id":"37086012763"},{"name":"Pete Florence","affiliation":["Google Research, USA"],"firstName":"Pete","lastName":"Florence","id":"37085786926"},{"name":"Jonathan Tompson","affiliation":["Google Research, USA"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Tompson","id":"38093908100"},{"name":"Erwin Coumans","affiliation":["Google Research, USA"],"firstName":"Erwin","lastName":"Coumans","id":"37086455409"},{"name":"Vikas Sindhwani","affiliation":["Google Research, USA"],"firstName":"Vikas","lastName":"Sindhwani","id":"37282057000"},{"name":"Ken Goldberg","affiliation":["Autolab at the University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Goldberg","id":"37273026700"},{"name":"Andy Zeng","affiliation":["Google Research, USA"],"firstName":"Andy","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37086217185"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561391","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Three-dimensional displays","Automation","Conferences","Benchmark testing","Fabrics","Planning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561391","abstract":"Rearranging and manipulating deformable objects such as cables, fabrics, and bags is a long-standing challenge in robotic manipulation. The complex dynamics and high-dimensional configuration spaces of deformables, compared to rigid objects, make manipulation difficult not only for multi-step planning, but even for goal specification. Goals cannot be as easily specified as rigid object poses, and may involve complex relative spatial relations such as \"place the item inside the bag\". In this work, we develop a suite of simulated benchmarks with 1D, 2D, and 3D deformable structures, including tasks that involve image-based goal-conditioning and multi-step deformable manipulation. We propose embedding goal-conditioning into Transporter Networks, a recently proposed model architecture for learning robotic manipulation that rearranges deep features to infer displacements that can represent pick and place actions. We demonstrate that goal-conditioned Transporter Networks enable agents to manipulate deformable structures into flexibly specified configurations without test-time visual anchors for target locations. We also significantly extend prior results using Transporter Networks for manipulating deformable objects by testing on tasks with 2D and 3D deformables.

The depth prediction from a CNN provides a reasonable initial point in the optimization process in the traditional SLAM algorithms, while the SLAM algorithms further improve the CNN prediction online. However, most of the current CNN-SLAM approaches have only taken advantage of the depth prediction but not yet other products from a CNN. In this work, we explore the use of the outlier mask, a by-product from unsupervised learning of depth from video, as a prior in a classical probability model for depth estimate fusion to step up the outlier-resistant tracking performance of a SLAM front-end. On the other hand, some of the previous CNN-SLAM work builds on feature-based sparse SLAM methods, wasting the per-pixel dense prediction from a CNN. In contrast to these sparse methods, we devise a dense CNN-assisted SLAM frontend that is implementable with TensorFlow and evaluate it on both indoor and outdoor datasets.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561392","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561392.pdf","startPage":"11732","endPage":"11738","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Front-End for Dense Monocular SLAM using a Learned Outlier Mask Prior","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Front-End for Dense Monocular SLAM using a Learned Outlier Mask Prior","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9561392/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561392/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Front-End for Dense Monocular SLAM using a Learned Outlier Mask Prior","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1745.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113147S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9561398,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Ainetter","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Ainetter","id":"37089000824"},{"name":"Friedrich Fraundorfer","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria"],"firstName":"Friedrich","lastName":"Fraundorfer","id":"37266352400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561398","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Automation","Conferences","Semantics","Feature extraction","Convolutional neural networks","Grippers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561398","abstract":"In this work, we introduce a novel, end-to-end trainable CNN-based architecture to deliver high quality results for grasp detection suitable for a parallel-plate gripper, and semantic segmentation.

A significant challenge in deploying closed loop controllers is reliable proprioception via integrated sensing in soft robots. Despite the considerable advances accomplished in fabrication, modelling, and model-based control of soft robots, integrated sensing and estimation is still in its infancy. To that end, this paper introduces a new method of estimating the degree of curvature of a soft robot using a stretchable sensing skin. The skin is a spray-coated piezoresistive sensing layer on a latex membrane. The mapping from the strain signal to the degree of curvature is estimated by using a recurrent neural network. We investigate uni-directional bending as well as bi-directional bending of a single-segment soft robot. Moreover, an adaptive controller is developed to track the degree of curvature of the soft robot in the presence of dynamic uncertainties. Subsequently, using the integrated soft sensing skin, we experimentally demonstrate successful curvature tracking control of the soft robot.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561447","startPage":"12170","endPage":"12176","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561447.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Tracking Control of Soft Robots Using Integrated Sensing Skins and Recurrent Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Uncertainty","Estimation","Soft robotics","Bending","Robot sensing systems","Skin"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Tracking Control of Soft Robots Using Integrated Sensing Skins and Recurrent Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9561447/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Tracking Control of Soft Robots Using Integrated Sensing Skins and Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0938.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088097S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9561454,"authors":[{"name":"Marin Dimitrov","affiliation":["University of Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Marin","lastName":"Dimitrov","id":"37088691357"},{"name":"Keir Groves","affiliation":["University of Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Keir","lastName":"Groves","id":"37086497192"},{"name":"David Howard","affiliation":["Robotics and Autonomous Systems Group, Data61, CSIRO, Australia"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Howard","id":"37086143521"},{"name":"Barry Lennox","affiliation":["University of Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Barry","lastName":"Lennox","id":"37299751200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561454","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561454","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Neural networks","Predictive models","Tools","Mathematical models","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Parametric statistics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561454","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561454.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","startPage":"5966","endPage":"5972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Identification of a Small Fully-Actuated Aquatic Surface Vehicle Using a Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network","abstract":"A long short-term memory neural network is used to provide a system model that captures the temporal-dynamics of a holonomic, fully-actuated aquatic surface vehicle. As is true in many fields, new developments in robotics often are made in simulation first before being applied to real systems. To simulate an aquatic or aerial robot, a dynamic system model of the robot is required. The more representative the dynamic model is of the real robot, the smaller the simulation-to-reality gap becomes. The performance of the neural network is compared against a classical parametric model, where coefficients of the parametric model were identified using the same data that was used to train the neural network. The results show that the neural network consistently outperforms the classical parametric model and significantly reduces the error between real velocities and estimated velocities. The neural network also demonstrated the ability to capture complex hydrodynamic effects that were not captured in the parametric model. In addition to the performance improvements, the neural network method can be easily adapted to similarly actuated aquatic vehicles by simply retraining, whereas the classical approach would require manual selection of new equation terms. The neural network model that was created has been used in a vehicle simulation and is presently being used as a research tool.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561454/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9561454/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Model Identification of a Small Fully-Actuated Aquatic Surface Vehicle Using a Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Identification of a Small Fully-Actuated Aquatic Surface Vehicle Using a Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1931.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066838S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":9561456,"authors":[{"name":"Cihan Acar","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Cihan","lastName":"Acar","id":"37088854551"},{"name":"Keng Peng Tee","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), A*STAR, Singapore"],"firstName":"Keng Peng","lastName":"Tee","id":"37275857100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561456","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"abstract":"Sampling-based motion planning under task constraints is challenging because the null-measure constraint manifold in the configuration space makes rejection sampling extremely inefficient, if not impossible.

This approach allows for the efficient drawing of constraint-satisfying samples online without any need for modification of available sampling-based motion planning algorithms. We evaluate the efficiency of these two generative models in terms of their sampling accuracy and coverage of sampling distribution.

This task is challenging since the behavior of an autonomous agent is not only affected by its own intention, but also by the static environment and surrounding dynamically interacting agents. Previous works focused on utilizing the spatial and temporal information in time domain while not sufficiently taking advantage of the cues in frequency domain. To this end, we propose a Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (SpecTGNN), which can capture inter-agent correlations and temporal dependency simultaneously in frequency domain in addition to time domain. SpecTGNN operates on both an agent graph with dynamic state information and an environment graph with the features extracted from context images in two streams. The model integrates graph Fourier transform, spectral graph convolution and temporal gated convolution to encode history information and forecast future trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate a multi-head spatio-temporal attention mechanism to mitigate the effect of error propagation in a long time horizon. We demonstrate the performance of SpecTGNN on two public trajectory prediction benchmark datasets, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of prediction accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561461/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9561461/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for Trajectory Prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for Trajectory Prediction","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101821S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9561540,"authors":[{"name":"Qin Li","affiliation":["School of Automation, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Li","id":"37089001673"},{"name":"Georgia Chalvatzaki","affiliation":["Intelligent Autonomous Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Georgia","lastName":"Chalvatzaki","id":"37085353493"},{"name":"Jan Peters","affiliation":["Intelligent Autonomous Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Peters","id":"37533077600"},{"name":"Yong Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407534600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561540","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Directed acyclic graph","Limiting","Neural networks","Dynamics","Human-robot interaction","Predictive models","Logic gates"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561540","abstract":"Human motion prediction is essential in human-robot interaction. Current research mostly considers the joint dependencies but ignores the bone dependencies and their relationship in the human skeleton, thus limiting the prediction accuracy. To address this issue, we represent the human skeleton as a directed acyclic graph with joints as vertexes and bones as directed edges. Then, we propose a novel directed acyclic graph neural network (DA-GNN) that follows the encoder-decoder structure. The encoder is stacked by multiple encoder blocks, each of which includes a directed acyclic graph computational operator (DA-GCO) to update joint and bone attributes based on the relationship between joint and bone dependencies in the observed human states, and a temporal update operator (TUO) to update the temporal dynamics of joints and bones in the same observation. After progressively implementing the above update process, the encoder outputs the final update result, fed into the decoder. The decoder includes a directed acyclic graph-based gated recurrent unit (DAG-GRU) and a multi-layered perceptron (MLP) to predict future human states sequentially. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to introduce the relationship between bone and joint dependencies in human motion prediction. Our experimental evaluations on two datasets, CMU Mocap and Human 3.6m, prove that DA-GNN outperforms current models. Finally, we showcase the efficacy of DA-GNN in a realistic HRI scenario.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561540","startPage":"3197","endPage":"3204","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561540.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directed Acyclic Graph Neural Network for Human Motion Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561540/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Directed Acyclic Graph Neural Network for Human Motion Prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9561540/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directed Acyclic Graph Neural Network for Human Motion Prediction","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"3419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.152489S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9561555,"authors":[{"name":"Mojtaba Esfandiari","affiliation":["University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Esfandiari","id":"38277118700"},{"name":"Farzam Farahmand","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Azadi Ave, Iran"],"firstName":"Farzam","lastName":"Farahmand","id":"37530736900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561555","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Endoscopes","Force","Artificial neural networks","Predictive models","Muscles","Electromyography"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561555","abstract":"This paper proposes an EMG-dependant neural network-based model of human forearm during interaction with a haptic training simulator of sinus endoscopy. We used a conventional lumped mass-spring-damper model as a base model, beside which we took effects of muscle activation level, using surface electromyography (EMG) signals, into consideration. Unknown parameters of a five-parameter mass-spring-damper model are optimised using experimental force and position data with a Levenberg\u2013Marquardt (LM) algorithm. In the training phase, parallel to this lumped model, a neural network (NN) structure is trained to learn the nonlinear mapping between the EMG signals (a way of measuring the muscles activation level that can be interpreted as muscle stiffness) and the parameters of the lumped model. In prediction (operational) phase, the trained neural network makes an estimate of the lumped parameters, using EMG and position data. Therefore, as apposed to conventional constant-parameter (CP) models, the parameters of the lumped model are not fixed in this method and are dependent to the muscle stiffness. Eight trials were performed while the operator was asked to to hold one\u2019s arm in a vertical plane such that their elbow had a right angle keep exerting a quasi-static and also reciprocating force in one direction\u2013a linear motion coaxial to their forearm. Haptic interface was programmed in a way to mimic the impedance model of sinus tissue, a nonlinear viscoelastic Kelvin-Voigt model previously developed by the authors. The estimated forces and the experimental forces are compared for two scenarios: once for the proposed EMG-dependant NN-based model and once again for the constant-parameter lumped model. Results demonstrate the precision improvement on the estimation of the exerted force from human hand to the haptic interface in the proposed model.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561555","startPage":"1790","endPage":"1795","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561555.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EMG-Based Neural Network Model of Human Arm Dynamics in a Haptic Training Simulator of Sinus Endoscopy<sup>*</sup>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561555/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"EMG-Based Neural Network Model of Human Arm Dynamics in a Haptic Training Simulator of Sinus Endoscopy<sup>*</sup>","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9561555/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002398","fundingName":"Sharif University of Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EMG-Based Neural Network Model of Human Arm Dynamics in a Haptic Training Simulator of Sinus Endoscopy<sup>*</sup>","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1946.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079295S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":9561586,"authors":[{"name":"Youngjae Yoo","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea","Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience, Seoul National University"],"firstName":"Youngjae","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37088998747"},{"name":"Chung-Yeon Lee","affiliation":["Seoul National University","Surromind Inc., Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Chung-Yeon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37088229821"},{"name":"Byoung-Tak Zhang","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea","Interdisciplinary Program in Neuroscience, Seoul National University","Seoul National University"],"firstName":"Byoung-Tak","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088229486"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561586","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Service robots","Vision sensors","Robot sensing systems","Reliability","Mobile robots","Synchronization"]}],"abstract":"Object slip perception is essential for mobile manipulation robots to perform manipulation tasks reliably in the dynamic real-world.

Previous methods have focused on either temporal contexts or local-to-global architectures that embed fixed-length spatiotemporal information. To date, there have not been effective proposals to simultaneously and flexibly capture varying spatiotemporal sequences and effectively achieves real-time 3D human pose estimation. In this work, we improve the learning of kinematic constraints in the human skeleton: posture, local kinematic connections, and symmetry by modeling local and global spatial information via attention mechanisms. To adapt to single- and multi-frame estimation, the dilated temporal model is employed to process varying skeleton sequences. Also, importantly, we carefully design the interleaving of spatial semantics with temporal dependencies to achieve a synergistic effect. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective graph attention spatio-temporal convolutional network (GAST-Net) that comprises of interleaved temporal convolutional and graph attention blocks. Experiments on two challenging benchmark datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) and YouTube videos demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates depth ambiguity and self-occlusion, generalizes to half upper body estimation, and achieves competitive performance on 2D-to-3D video pose estimation.

In this paper, we propose the first method to model and learn full 3D dynamics of DLOs from data. Our approach is capable of capturing the complex twisting and bending dynamics of DLOs and allows local effects to propagate globally. To this end, we adapt the interaction network (IN) dynamics learning method for capturing the interaction between neighboring segments in a DLO and augment it with a recurrent model for propagating interaction effects along the length of a DLO. For learning twisting and bending dynamics in 3D, we also introduce a new suitable representation of DLO segments and their relationships. Unlike the original IN method, our model learns to propagate the effects of local interaction between neighboring segments to each segment in the chain within a single time step, without the need for iterated propagation steps. Evaluation of our model with synthetic and newly collected real-world data shows better accuracy and generalization in short-term and long- term predictions than the current state of the art. We further integrate our learned model in a model predictive control scheme and use it to successfully control the shape of a DLO.

We demonstrate the real-time estimation of friction and measurement of 3D force from PapillArray sensors mounted on each finger of a two-finger gripper, combined with a closed-loop grip-force control algorithm that dynamically applies a near-optimal grip force to avoid dropping objects of varying weight and friction. A vertical lifting task was performed using an object with varying weight and friction, and with some common household items. After intentionally adding a 20% safety margin on the target grip force, the actual grip force applied was only 9-30 % greater than that required to avoid slip. Future work will focus on incorporating real-time torque measurement into the grip force feedback control. This will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in artificial tactile sensing and bring us closer to robotic dexterity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561640.pdf","startPage":"1608","endPage":"1614","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time Friction Estimation for Grip Force Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Weight measurement","Three-dimensional displays","Friction","Force","Estimation","Tactile sensors","Real-time systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Real-time Friction Estimation for Grip Force Control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9561640/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time Friction Estimation for Grip Force Control","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1959.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086053S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9561653,"authors":[{"name":"Mengyu Fu","affiliation":["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Mengyu","lastName":"Fu","id":"37086578786"},{"name":"Oren Salzman","affiliation":["Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Israel"],"firstName":"Oren","lastName":"Salzman","id":"37077497700"},{"name":"Ron Alterovitz","affiliation":["University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Ron","lastName":"Alterovitz","id":"37320259800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561653","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"abstract":"The inspection-planning problem calls for computing motions for a robot that allow it to inspect a set of points of interest (POIs) while considering plan quality (e.g., plan length). This problem has applications across many domains where robots can help with inspection, including infrastructure maintenance, construction, and surgery. Incremental Random Inspection-roadmap Search (IRIS) is an asymptotically-optimal inspection planner that was shown to compute higher-quality inspection plans orders of magnitudes faster than the prior state-of-the-art method. In this paper, we significantly accelerate the performance of IRIS to broaden its applicability to more challenging real-world applications.

In this work, we show how to incorporate lazy edge-evaluation techniques into IRIS\u2019s search algorithm and how to reuse search efforts when a roadmap undergoes local changes. These enhancements, which do not compromise IRIS\u2019s asymptotic optimality, enable us to compute inspection plans much faster than the original IRIS. We apply IRIS with the enhancements to simulated bridge inspection and surgical inspection tasks and show that our new algorithm for some scenarios can compute similar-quality inspection plans 570\u00d7 faster than prior work.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561653.pdf","startPage":"7449","endPage":"7456","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561653","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computationally-Efficient Roadmap-based Inspection Planning via Incremental Lazy Search","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iris","Conferences","Surgery","Inspection","Maintenance engineering","Computational efficiency","Planning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Computationally-Efficient Roadmap-based Inspection Planning via Incremental Lazy Search","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9561653/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally-Efficient Roadmap-based Inspection Planning via Incremental Lazy Search","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104078S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9561665,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Xu","id":"37087083468"},{"name":"Xingyu Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Xingyu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085568094"},{"name":"Xuguang Lan","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Xuguang","lastName":"Lan","id":"37270865300"},{"name":"Nanning Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Nanning","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37271536700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561665","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561665","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Automation","Conferences","Neural networks","Predictive models","Benchmark testing","Probabilistic logic"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561665","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561665.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","startPage":"3190","endPage":"3196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Human Motion Prediction via A Bayesian Neural Network","abstract":"Human motion prediction is an important and challenging topic that has promising prospects in efficient and safe human-robot-interaction systems. Currently, the majority of the human motion prediction algorithms are based on deterministic models, which may lead to risky decisions for robots. To solve this problem, we propose a probabilistic model for human motion prediction in this paper. The key idea of our approach is to extend the conventional deterministic motion prediction neural network to a Bayesian one. On one hand, our model could generate several future motions when given an observed motion sequence. On the other hand, by calculating the Epistemic Uncertainty and the Heteroscedastic Aleatoric Uncertainty, our model could tell the robot if the observation has been seen before and also give the optimal result among all possible predictions. We extensively validate our approach on a large scale benchmark dataset Human3.6m. The experiments show that our approach performs better than deterministic methods. We further evaluate our approach in a Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) scenario. The experimental results show that our approach makes the interaction more efficient and safer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561665/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9561665/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Human Motion Prediction via A Bayesian Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Human Motion Prediction via A Bayesian Neural Network","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094854S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561665","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":9561678,"authors":[{"name":"Niels Dehio","affiliation":["LIRMM, Interactive Digital Humans group, CNRS-University of Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Niels","lastName":"Dehio","id":"37085760535"},{"name":"Abderrahmane Kheddar","affiliation":["LIRMM, Interactive Digital Humans group, CNRS-University of Montpellier, France","CNRS-AIST Joint Robotics Laboratory, IRL, Japan"],"firstName":"Abderrahmane","lastName":"Kheddar","id":"37293875300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561678","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561678","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automation","Conferences","End effectors","Hardware","Task analysis","Manipulator dynamics","Strain"]}],"abstract":"Safely generating impacts with robots is challenging due to subsequent discontinuous velocity and high impact forces.

Consider driving a car through a busy intersection: it is necessary to reason about the physics of the vehicle, the intentions of other drivers, and their beliefs about your own intentions. For example, if you signal a turn, another driver might yield to you; or if you enter the passing lane, another driver might decelerate to give you room to merge in front. Competent drivers must plan how they can safely react to a variety of potential future behaviors of other agents before they make their next move. This requires contingency planning: explicitly planning a set of conditional actions that depend on the stochastic outcome of future events. In this work, we develop a general-purpose contingency planner that is learned end-to-end using high-dimensional scene observations and low-dimensional behavioral observations. We use a conditional autoregressive flow model for contingency planning. We show how this model can tractably learn contingencies from behavioral observations. We developed a closed-loop control benchmark of realistic multi-agent scenarios in a driving simulator (CARLA), on which we compare our method to various noncontingent methods that reason about multi-agent future behavior, and find that our contingency planning method achieves qualitatively and quantitatively superior performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561683","startPage":"13663","endPage":"13669","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561683.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contingencies from Observations: Tractable Contingency Planning with Learned Behavior Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Contingencies from Observations: Tractable Contingency Planning with Learned Behavior Models","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9561683/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561683/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contingencies from Observations: Tractable Contingency Planning with Learned Behavior Models","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109767S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9561687,"authors":[{"name":"Dafni Anagnostopoulou","affiliation":["School of ECE, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Dafni","lastName":"Anagnostopoulou","id":"37089001378"},{"name":"Niki Efthymiou","affiliation":["School of ECE, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Niki","lastName":"Efthymiou","id":"37085415030"},{"name":"Christina Papailiou","affiliation":["University of West Attica, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Christina","lastName":"Papailiou","id":"37086189905"},{"name":"Petros Maragos","affiliation":["School of ECE, National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Petros","lastName":"Maragos","id":"37285070800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561687","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561687","abstract":"Estimating the engagement of children is an essential prerequisite for constructing natural Child-Robot Interaction.

Our model employs a variant of a fast single-stage CNN architecture to segment plane instances. Considering the particularity of the target detected, we propose Fast Feature Non-maximum Suppression (FF-NMS) to reduce the suppression errors resulted from overlapping bounding boxes of planes. We also utilize a Residual Feature Augmentation module in the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) . Our method achieves significantly higher frame-rates and comparable segmentation accuracy against two-stage methods. We automatically label over 70,000 images as ground truth from the Stanford 2D-3D-Semantics dataset.

We explore the key role that distributed tactile sensing plays in localizing contacts external to the robot, in contrast to the role that aggregated force/torque measurements traditionally play in localizing contacts on the robot. When in contact with the environment, an object will move in accordance with the kinematic and possibly frictional constraints imposed by that contact. Small motions of the object, which are observable with tactile sensors, indirectly encode those constraints and the geometry that defines them.We formulate the extrinsic contact sensing problem as a constraint-based estimation problem. The estimation is subject to the kinematic constraints imposed by the tactile measurements of object motion, as well as the kinematic (e.g., non-penetration) and possibly frictional (e.g., sticking) constraints imposed by rigid-body mechanics. We validate the approach in simulation and with real experiments on the case studies of fixed point and line contacts.This paper discusses the theoretical basis for the value of distributed tactile sensing in contrast to aggregated force/torque measurements. It also provides an estimation framework for localizing environmental contacts with potential impact in contact-rich manipulation scenarios such as assembling or packing.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561781","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561781.pdf","startPage":"11262","endPage":"11268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extrinsic Contact Sensing with Relative-Motion Tracking from Distributed Tactile Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561781/","displayDocTitle":"Extrinsic Contact Sensing with Relative-Motion Tracking from Distributed Tactile Measurements","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"30 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9561781/","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010428","fundingName":"Innovation and Technology Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extrinsic Contact Sensing with Relative-Motion Tracking from Distributed Tactile Measurements","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073442S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9561801,"authors":[{"name":"Ruben Mascaro","affiliation":["Vision For Robotics Lab, ETH, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"Mascaro","id":"37086455262"},{"name":"Lucas Teixeira","affiliation":["Vision For Robotics Lab, ETH, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lucas","lastName":"Teixeira","id":"37086010655"},{"name":"Margarita Chli","affiliation":["Vision For Robotics Lab, ETH, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Margarita","lastName":"Chli","id":"37546501900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561801","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Image segmentation","Three-dimensional displays","Semantics","Neural networks","Training data","Probabilistic logic"]}],"abstract":"Semantic 3D scene understanding is a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics.

In the field experiments the RF controller obtained clearly better success rates. In this work, the previous findings are drastically revised by experimenting summer time trained controllers in winter conditions. The winter experiments revealed a need for additional sensors, more training data, and a controller that can take advantage of these. Therefore, we propose a revised neural controller (NNetV2) which has a more expressive structure and uses a neural attention mechanism to focus on important parts of the sensor and control signals. Using the same data and sensors to train and test the three controllers, NNetV2 achieves better robustness against drastically changing conditions and superior success rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work testing a learning-based controller for a heavy-duty machine in drastically varying outdoor conditions and delivering high success rate in winter, being trained in summer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9561804/","displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Controller for Autonomous Pile Loading Revised","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Controller for Autonomous Pile Loading Revised","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086881S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":9561827,"authors":[{"name":"Martina Lippi","affiliation":["Roma Tre University, Italy"],"firstName":"Martina","lastName":"Lippi","id":"37086443839"},{"name":"Giuseppe Gillini","affiliation":["University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Gillini","id":"37087103540"},{"name":"Alessandro Marino","affiliation":["University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Marino","id":"37390952800"},{"name":"Filippo Arrichiello","affiliation":["University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Italy"],"firstName":"Filippo","lastName":"Arrichiello","id":"37298259000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561827","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Uncertainty","Automation","Conferences","Time series analysis","Collaboration","Complexity theory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561827","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561827.pdf","startPage":"3597","endPage":"3603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Data-Driven Approach for Contact Detection, Classification and Reaction in Physical Human-Robot Collaboration","abstract":"This paper considers a scenario where a robot and a human operator share the same workspace, and the robot is able to both carry out autonomous tasks and physically interact with the human in order to achieve common goals. In this context, both intentional and accidental contacts between human and robot might occur due to the complexity of tasks and environment, to the uncertainty of human behavior, and to the typical lack of awareness of each other actions. Here, a two stage strategy based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is designed to detect intentional and accidental contacts: the occurrence of a contact with the human is detected at the first stage, while the classification between intentional and accidental is performed at the second stage. An admittance control strategy or an evasive action is then performed by the robot, respectively. The approach also works in the case the robot simultaneously interacts with the human and the environment, where the interaction wrench of the latter is modeled via Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are included, at the control level, to guarantee the satisfaction of robot and task constraints while performing the proper interaction strategy. The approach has been validated on a real setup composed of a Kinova Jaco2 robot.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9561827/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Data-Driven Approach for Contact Detection, Classification and Reaction in Physical Human-Robot Collaboration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Data-Driven Approach for Contact Detection, Classification and Reaction in Physical Human-Robot Collaboration","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081734S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9561849,"authors":[{"name":"Xinneng Yang","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xinneng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088998267"},{"name":"Yan Wu","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281232900"},{"name":"Junqiao Zhao","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China","Institute of Intelligent Vehicle, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Junqiao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086158636"},{"name":"Feilin Liu","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Feilin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37089001162"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561849","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Automation","Conferences","Computational modeling","Semantics","Graphics processing units","Real-time systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561849","abstract":"Real-time semantic segmentation is a challenging task as both accuracy and inference speed need to be considered simultaneously. In real-world applications, it is usually achieved by deploying a deep neural network in modern GPU device. However, most of the work focused on real-time semantic segmentation is designed by significantly reducing computation complexity and model size. There are other factors that have a significant impact on inference speed are overlooked, especially when the network is running in modern GPU device. In this paper, we focus on designing a GPU-efficient network as backbone for real-time semantic segmentation. Dense connectivity can preserve and accumulate feature maps of multiple receptive fields and is therefore ideal for semantic segmentation. Therefore, we design a GPU-efficient network (DenseENet) with dense connectivity. The proposed DenseENet shows an obvious advantage in balancing accuracy and inference speed in modern GPU device. Specifically, on Cityscapes test set, DenseENet with a simple FCN decoder achieves 75.2% mIoU with 83.6 FPS for an input of 1024 \u00d7 2048 resolution and 73.6% mIoU with 132 FPS for an input of 768

Most state-of-the-art semantic mapping systems are based on supervised learning algorithms that cannot classify novel observations online. While unsupervised learning algorithms can invent labels for novel observations, approaches to detect when multiple robots have independently developed their own labels for the same new class are prone to erroneous or inconsistent matches. These issues worsen as the number of robots in the system increases and prevent fusing the local maps produced by each robot into a consistent global map, which is crucial for cooperative planning and joint mission summarization. Our proposed solution overcomes these obstacles by having each robot learn an unsupervised semantic scene model online and use a multiway matching algorithm to identify consistent sets of matches between learned semantic labels belonging to different robots.

One prong is dedicated to predicting how the static environment will be observed by the moving ego vehicle. The other prong predicts how the dynamic objects in the environment will move. Experiments conducted on the real-world Waymo Open Dataset indicate that the fused output of the two prongs is capable of retaining dynamic objects and reducing blurriness in the predictions for longer time horizons than baseline models.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561940","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561940.pdf","startPage":"13931","endPage":"13937","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double-Prong ConvLSTM for Spatiotemporal Occupancy Prediction in Dynamic Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Double-Prong ConvLSTM for Spatiotemporal Occupancy Prediction in Dynamic Environments","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9561940/","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double-Prong ConvLSTM for Spatiotemporal Occupancy Prediction in Dynamic Environments","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057214S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561940","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":9561956,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph A.

Our method is well-suited for use in rigorous safety analysis of robotic perception and control systems with deep neural network components. Our algorithm can compute both forward and backward reachable sets for a ReLU network iterated over multiple time steps, as would be found in a perception-action loop in a robotic system. Our algorithm is unique in that it builds the reachable sets by incrementally enumerating polyhedral cells in the input space, rather than iterating layer-by-layer through the network as in other methods. If an unsafe cell is found, our algorithm can return this result without completing the full reachability computation, thus giving an anytime property that accelerates safety verification. In addition, our method requires less memory during execution compared to existing methods where memory can be a limiting factor. We demonstrate our algorithm on safety verification of the ACAS Xu aircraft advisory system. We find unsafe actions many times faster than the fastest existing method and certify no unsafe actions exist in about twice the time of the existing method. We also compute forward and backward reachable sets for a learned model of pendulum dynamics over a 50 time step horizon in 87s on a laptop computer.

The manipulation of FFCs typically relies on highly trained workers that spend hours performing the same repetitive processes, or on autonomous robotic systems that are equipped with simple clamping mechanisms or pneumatically driven suction cups. Such robotic systems are difficult to program and reprogram and often rely on sophisticated sensing elements and complicated control laws. Moreover, the performance and robustness of such systems is far from sufficient, hindering their mass adoption. The manipulation of FFCs is also quite challenging. A good gripper should be able to pinch the cable steadily and execute insertion tasks of the cable connector with ease. The suction cup based solution is a good approach for holding the cable, but it makes the cable connector insertion very challenging as it can only apply limited shear forces. In this paper, we propose a locally-adaptive, pneumatic, parallel-jaw robot gripper equipped with fingertips that are able to both pinch the cable with a soft clamping mechanism and roll the cable surface on the soft fingertip structure until it reaches the desired connector. The gripper base accommodates a camera that allows for the recognition and pose estimation of the flat, flexible cables and other electronic components. The gripper is of low-cost and low-complexity and it can facilitate the efficient and robust execution of FFC grasping and assembly tasks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561970","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561970.pdf","startPage":"6941","endPage":"6947","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Locally-Adaptive, Parallel-Jaw Gripper with Clamping and Rolling Capable, Soft Fingertips for Fine Manipulation of Flexible Flat Cables","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Locally-Adaptive, Parallel-Jaw Gripper with Clamping and Rolling Capable, Soft Fingertips for Fine Manipulation of Flexible Flat Cables","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9561970/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561970/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Locally-Adaptive, Parallel-Jaw Gripper with Clamping and Rolling Capable, Soft Fingertips for Fine Manipulation of Flexible Flat Cables","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090287S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9561975,"authors":[{"name":"Lun Gong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Mechanism Theory and Equipment Design of Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Lun","lastName":"Gong","id":"37088468906"},{"name":"Siyang Zuo","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Mechanism Theory and Equipment Design of Ministry of Education, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Siyang","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37085492756"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9561975","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"Due to the limited field of view (FOV), the probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) imaging system remains challenging to be widely used in clinic. Existing video mosaicking approaches are usually troubled by poor real-time capability and sensitivity to tissue deformations and intensity fluctuations. In this paper, a novel pCLE mosaicking algorithm that simultaneously implements rigid probe motion tracking and inter-frame tissue deformation correction is proposed. The sum of conditional variance (SCV) metric with low calculational complexity and intensity variation invariance is embedded into the reconstruction of pCLE mosaics. We also deduce the derivatives of the SCV metric with respect to transformation variables to enhance the robustness of numerical solutions. Moreover, a parallel acceleration mechanism that maximally exploits the resources of graphics processing unit (GPU) is designed to boost mosaicking efficiency. Experiments on lens tissue paper and swine tissue highlight the excellent mosaicking accuracy of the proposed method in this field. It is also verified that the mosaic-king rate of the proposed method exceeds 14 frames per second (fps), which can keep up with the acquisition rate of most pCLE imaging systems (8 fps~12 fps). Benefiting from finer mosaics and faster speed, the proposed algorithm has high potential to achieve large and accurate mosaicking for intraoperative endomicroscopy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09561975.pdf","startPage":"14220","endPage":"14226","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9561975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9561975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward intraoperative endomicroscopy with a GPU-accelerated deformable video mosaicking algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensitivity","Tracking","Lasers","Imaging","Graphics processing units","Endomicroscopy","Streaming media"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy","video mosaicking","real-time","SCV","GPU"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9561975/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Toward intraoperative endomicroscopy with a GPU-accelerated deformable video mosaicking algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9561975/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward intraoperative endomicroscopy with a GPU-accelerated deformable video mosaicking algorithm","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"3111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089548S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9561975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9562021,"authors":[{"name":"Trevor Olsen","affiliation":["University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Olsen","id":"37089000508"},{"name":"Anne M.

The best known complete algorithm for this problem takes time doubly exponential in the number of robots. However, sampling-based techniques have shown promise in generating feasible solutions in these scenarios. One of the primary drawbacks to employing existing sampling-based methods is that existing algorithms have long execution times and high failure rates for complex environments. This paper addresses that limitation by proposing a new algorithm that takes an environment as its input and returns a joint motion strategy which ensures that the evader is captured by one of the pursuers. Starting with a single pursuer, we sequentially construct Sample-Generated Pursuit-Evasion Graphs to create such a joint motion strategy. This sequential graph structure ensures that our algorithm will always terminate with a solution, regardless of the complexity of the environment. We describe an implementation of this algorithm and present quantitative results that show significant improvement in comparison to the existing algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Visibility Roadmap Sampling Approach for a Multi-Robot Visibility-Based Pursuit-Evasion Problem","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562021","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09562021.pdf","startPage":"7957","endPage":"7964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562021","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562021/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Visibility Roadmap Sampling Approach for a Multi-Robot Visibility-Based Pursuit-Evasion Problem","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562021/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Visibility Roadmap Sampling Approach for a Multi-Robot Visibility-Based Pursuit-Evasion Problem","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1677.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101213S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9562021","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9562043,"authors":[{"name":"Ilker Bozcan","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence in Robotics Laboratory (Air Lab), Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark"],"firstName":"Ilker","lastName":"Bozcan","id":"37086455563"},{"name":"Erdal Kayacan","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence in Robotics Laboratory (Air Lab), Aarhus University, Aarhus C, Denmark"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Kayacan","id":"37595300900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9562043","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surveillance","Traffic control","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Real-time systems","Sensors","Feeds","Task analysis"]}],"abstract":"The detection of contextual anomalies is a challenging task for surveillance since an observation can be considered anomalous or normal in a specific environmental context. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can utilize its aerial monitoring capability and employ multiple sensors to gather contextual information about the environment and perform contextual anomaly detection. In this work, we introduce a deep neural network-based method (CADNet) to find point anomalies (i.e., single instance anomalous data) and contextual anomalies (i.e., context-specific abnormality) in an environment using a UAV. The method is based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a context sub-network. The context sub-network extracts contextual information regarding the environment using GPS and time data, then feeds it to the VAE to predict anomalies conditioned on the context. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first contextual anomaly detection method for UAV-assisted aerial surveillance.

However, sparse roadmaps do not scale well to high-dimensional planning problems. In prior work, we showed improved planning performance on high-dimensional planning problems by using multilevel abstractions to simplify state spaces. In this work, we generalize sparse roadmaps to multilevel abstractions by developing a novel algorithm, the sparse multilevel roadmap planner (SMLR). To this end, we represent multilevel abstractions using the language of fiber bundles, and generalize sparse roadmap planners by using the concept of restriction sampling with visibility regions. We argue SMLR to be probabilistically complete and asymptotically near-optimal by inheritance from sparse roadmap planners. In evaluations, we outperform sparse roadmap planners on challenging planning problems, in particular problems which are high-dimensional, contain narrow passages or are infeasible. We thereby demonstrate sparse multilevel roadmaps as an efficient tool for feasible and infeasible high-dimensional planning problems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09562053.pdf","startPage":"7851","endPage":"7857","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Multilevel Roadmaps for High-Dimensional Robotic Motion Planning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot motion","Geometry","Automation","Conferences","Tools","Probabilistic logic","Planning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Multilevel Roadmaps for High-Dimensional Robotic Motion Planning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562053/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Multilevel Roadmaps for High-Dimensional Robotic Motion Planning","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"0263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093883S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9562053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9562067,"authors":[{"name":"Jory Denny","affiliation":["SpiRoL: Spider Robotics Lab, University of Richmond, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Jory","lastName":"Denny","id":"37947351200"},{"name":"David Qin","affiliation":["SpiRoL: Spider Robotics Lab, University of Richmond, VA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Qin","id":"37089001096"},{"name":"Hanglin Zhou","affiliation":["SpiRoL: Spider Robotics Lab, University of Richmond, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Hanglin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086578070"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9562067","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562067","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Automation","Conferences","Approximation algorithms","Cognition","Planning","Computational efficiency"]}],"abstract":"One key aspect to planning safe motions for a robot requires maintaining a minimum distance from obstacles. The medial axis, or the set of all points equidistant to two or more obstacles, is useful for planning in this context. However, it is computationally intensive to compute this structure directly. As such, prior research proposed directly sampling this structure to avoid its explicit computation. In this paper, we revisit the computational cost of these sampling-based techniques for motion planning, and we propose a novel approximation algorithm that significantly reduces the necessary collision detection invocations in generating samples near the medial axis. At its core, our technique approximates the clearance of a configuration by reasoning about the clearance of nearby configurations. Ultimately, our approach reduces the computational burden of planning on or near the medial axis.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562067","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09562067.pdf","startPage":"10213","endPage":"10219","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast and Approximate Medial Axis Sampling Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Fast and Approximate Medial Axis Sampling Technique","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9562067/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562067/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast and Approximate Medial Axis Sampling Technique","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"3993.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063393S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9562067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9562077,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Floriano V\u00e1zquez","affiliation":["University of Bristol"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Floriano V\u00e1zquez","id":"37089002139"},{"name":"Nathan F.

For a test scenario, we consider optical tactile sensing in combination with DL to estimate the edge pose as a feedback signal to servo around various 2D test objects. We demonstrate that uncertainty-aware DL can improve the pose estimation over deterministic DL methods. The system estimates the uncertainty associated with each prediction, which is used along with temporal coherency to improve the predictions via a Kalman filter, and hence improve the tactile servo control. The robot is able to robustly follow all of the presented contour shapes to reduce not only the error by a factor of two but also smooth the trajectory from the undesired noisy behaviour caused by previous deterministic networks. In our view, as the field of tactile robotics matures in its use of DL, the estimation of uncertainty will become a key component in the control of physically interactive tasks in complex environments.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562077","startPage":"1615","endPage":"1621","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09562077.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncertainty-aware deep learning for robot touch: Application to Bayesian tactile servo control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","displayDocTitle":"Uncertainty-aware deep learning for robot touch: Application to Bayesian tactile servo control","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562077/","accessionNumber":"21257550","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562077/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000275","fundingName":"Leverhulme Trust"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncertainty-aware deep learning for robot touch: Application to Bayesian tactile servo control","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1961.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083763S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9562077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9562104,"authors":[{"name":"Scott Chow","affiliation":["Collaborative Robotics and Intelligent Systems (CoRIS) Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Chow","id":"37088999309"},{"name":"Gina Olson","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA"],"firstName":"Gina","lastName":"Olson","id":"37085437507"},{"name":"Geoffrey A.

The lack of a fast and accurate simulator prevents motion planners from generating feasible plans, which would enable soft robots to achieve more complex tasks, such as manipulation. In this work, we propose combining a simplified quasistatic model with a neural network that learns to compensate for unmodeled forces, such as friction and loads, in order to create a fast forward model for soft manipulators with multiple segments. We show that the resulting neural network model reduces average end effector position error by 62% compared to the quasistatic model, while still being fast enough for motion planning. We also incorporate this model into an RRT*-based planner and demonstrate that the plans generated using our model are more likely to be feasible when executed on hardware than plans generated with a simulator using the quasistatic model.","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562104","startPage":"11805","endPage":"11811","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09562104.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensating for Unmodeled Forces using Neural Networks in Soft Manipulator Planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562104/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Compensating for Unmodeled Forces using Neural Networks in Soft Manipulator Planning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562104/","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensating for Unmodeled Forces using Neural Networks in Soft Manipulator Planning","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"4110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054509S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9562104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":9562111,"authors":[{"name":"Rob Weston","affiliation":["Applied Artificial Intelligence Lab (A2I), University of Oxford"],"firstName":"Rob","lastName":"Weston","id":"37086936297"},{"name":"Oiwi Parker Jones","affiliation":["Applied Artificial Intelligence Lab (A2I), University of Oxford"],"firstName":"Oiwi Parker","lastName":"Jones","id":"37088690104"},{"name":"Ingmar Posner","affiliation":["Applied Artificial Intelligence Lab (A2I), University of Oxford"],"firstName":"Ingmar","lastName":"Posner","id":"37601368300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9077-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9078-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2577-087X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"1050-4729"}],"articleNumber":"9562111","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Laser radar","Radar measurements","Stochastic processes","Radar","Radar imaging","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","optical radar","optimisation","radar imaging","radar signal processing","remote sensing by radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclical consistency criterion","backward model","down-stream segmentation model","real-world deployment","simulate radar data","real-world applications","realistic radar data","data-driven approaches","radar processing","notoriously complex image formation process","radar sensor model","faithful radar observations","simulated elevation maps","adversarial approach","forward sensor model","unaligned radar examples","world state"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562111","doi":"10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRA48506.2021.9562111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560666","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9560720/9560666/09562111.pdf","startPage":"12809","endPage":"12816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"There and Back Again: Learning to Simulate Radar Data for Real-World Applications","abstract":"Simulating realistic radar data has the potential to significantly accelerate the development of data-driven approaches to radar processing. However, it is fraught with difficulty due to the notoriously complex image formation process. Here we propose to learn a radar sensor model capable of synthesising faithful radar observations based on simulated elevation maps. In particular, we adopt an adversarial approach to learning a forward sensor model from unaligned radar examples. In addition, modelling the backward model encourages the output to remain aligned to the world state through a cyclical consistency criterion. The backward model is further constrained to predict elevation maps from real radar data that are grounded by partial measurements obtained from corresponding lidar scans. Both models are trained in a joint optimisation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by evaluating a down-stream segmentation model trained purely on simulated data in a real-world deployment. This achieves performance within four percentage points of the same model trained entirely on real data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-5 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9562111/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","publicationDate":"30 May 2021","accessionNumber":"21257460","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"There and Back Again: Learning to Simulate Radar Data for Real-World Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"There and Back Again: Learning to Simulate Radar Data for Real-World Applications","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"1524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.145793S","chronDate":"May 30 2021-June 5 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9560720","isNumber":"9560666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9560720","xplore-issue":"9560666","articleId":"9562111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9562136,"authors":[{"name":"Iandra Galdino","affiliation":["UFRJ/COPPE SMT Laboratory, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"firstName":"Iandra","lastName":"Galdino","id":"37088466386"},{"name":"Didier Le Ruyet","affiliation":["CNAM CEDRIC/LAETITIA, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Didier Le","lastName":"Ruyet","id":"37594948600"},{"name":"Rostom Zakaria","affiliation":["CNAM CEDRIC/LAETITIA, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Rostom","lastName":"Zakaria","id":"37603887300"},{"name":"Marcello L.

One important issue in VLC networks is to address the multiple-access (MA) requirement. Non-orthogonal MA (NOMA) is a promising technique for multi-cell VLC networks, in particular, due to providing high spectral efficiency. However, its performance is highly impacted by the considered power allocation (PA). In this paper, we propose optimization of PA in NOMA-based VLC networks using particle swarm optimization. The presented results show that the optimized PA offers a higher performance in terms of the network achievable throughput and fairness, compared with non-optimized PA, while offering flexibility in controlling the desired performance criteria.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562144","publicationTitle":"2021 17th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 17th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562156/9562133/09562144.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562133","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Allocation Optimization in NOMA-Based Multi-Cell VLC Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Allocation Optimization in NOMA-Based Multi-Cell VLC Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562144/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"6 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9562144/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Allocation Optimization in NOMA-Based Multi-Cell VLC Networks","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p269-eltokhey.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106159S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562156","isNumber":"9562133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562156","xplore-issue":"9562133","articleId":"9562144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9562147,"authors":[{"name":"Valentina Rizzello","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Valentina","lastName":"Rizzello","id":"37086863529"},{"name":"Nurettin Turan","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Nurettin","lastName":"Turan","id":"37088445722"},{"name":"Michael Joham","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Joham","id":"37285062400"},{"name":"Wolfgang Utschick","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Utschick","id":"37273316200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7432-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7433-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"9562147","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562147","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Training","Sufficient conditions","Simulation","System performance","Neural networks","Downlink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine learning","FDD systems","maximum mean discrepancy","deep learning","autoencoder neural networks"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we present a two-sample tests analysis based on the maximum mean discrepancy metric to validate the recently proposed uplink-downlink conjecture for frequency division duplex systems.

However, it is a nontrivial endeavor to develop such a healthcare service due to two major challenges: 1) the treatment records are complex data objects consisting of various semantic and temporal information, and 2) the treatment outcome usually depends on a large number of internal and external factors. Because of these difficulties, automatic treatment regimen design is still an open research problem nowadays. To fill this research gap, this paper first formulates a treatment sequence as temporal sets, then provides a novel Extended Jaccard Similarity (EJS) measure to quantify the similarities between treatment sequences. We show that the proposed EJS is a general and effective measure to capture the similarity between two complex temporal sets. Further, we develop an efficient clustering algorithm which can achieve reasonable clustering results with only a portion of the pairwise similarities between treatment sequences and then extract a semantic prototype of the treatment regimen from each cluster of treatment sequences. Finally, we adopt a matrix factorization framework to predict the treatment outcomes by integrating multiple internal and external factors. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) of more than 28,000 patients from 14 hospitals. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its superiority over the state-of-the-art ones.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2020.2972276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/9560665/09562154.pdf","startPage":"3494","endPage":"3506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2020.2972276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9560665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Treatment Regimen Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 1 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562154/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Treatment Regimen Design","volume":"33","issue":"11","publicationDate":"1 Nov. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562154/","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"71771034, 71901011, 71490724, 51778033 and 51822802"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1811463"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Treatment Regimen Design","sourcePdf":"tkde-sun-2972276-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.211054S","chronDate":"Nov. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"9560665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","xplore-issue":"9560665","articleId":"9562154","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":9562171,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Chen","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37088940787"},{"name":"Xijuan Guo","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Xijuan","lastName":"Guo","id":"37406270400"},{"name":"Zheng Chang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Chang","id":"38236304200"},{"name":"Timo H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen","id":"37269442700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7432-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7433-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"9562171","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Energy consumption","Computational modeling","Wireless networks","Resource management","Task analysis","Optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-access edge computing","fron-thaul/backhaul link","offloading","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"Edge computing is able to provide proximity solutions for the future wireless network to accommodate different types of devices with various computing service demands.

To further improve synchronization accuracy in channeling environments, which can also be applied in the LEO networks, we present a new method for estimating the carrier frequency offset (CFO) and frame misalignment in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based inter-satellite links. The proposed method requires the transmission of pilot symbols to exploit 2-D estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) and estimate the CFO and the frame misalignment. The Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) of the joint estimation of the CFO and frame misalignment are also derived. Numerical results show that the difference between the proposed method and the state-of-art method is less than 5dB at its worse.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562177","publicationTitle":"2021 17th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 17th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562156/9562133/09562177.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562133","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmonic Retrieval of CFO and Frame Misalignment for OFDM-based Inter-Satellite Links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562177","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Harmonic Retrieval of CFO and Frame Misalignment for OFDM-based Inter-Satellite Links","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562177/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"6 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9562177/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic Retrieval of CFO and Frame Misalignment for OFDM-based Inter-Satellite Links","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p565-senyuva.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044279S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562156","isNumber":"9562133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562156","xplore-issue":"9562133","articleId":"9562177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9562188,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Nafea","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, MI"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Nafea","id":"37085397609"},{"name":"Aylin Yener","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH"],"firstName":"Aylin","lastName":"Yener","id":"37273211500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7432-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7433-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"9562188","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"abstract":"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are being considered as a candidate technology for next generation of wireless systems (6G), for improving reliability and range extension owing to their low cost and complexity, and suitability for high-frequency schemes. RIS terminals can effectively operate as relaying nodes for transmitted signals, while saving the energy needed for Radio Frequency (RF) transmission. This is implemented by deploying controllable reflecting arrays of meta-surface elements, whose phase can be adjusted by applying fast switching voltage. RIS thus creates a valuable resource in wireless communication: the control over the channel realizations from the RIS relays to the receiver. In this work, we investigate the impact of this resource on improving secure communication rates between a transmitter (base station) and a receiver (end user), in the presence of an external eavesdropper. We consider a multi-antenna wiretap channel aided with a RIS array, and derive the achievable secure degrees of freedom for various number of antennas at different terminals. Our achievability scheme relies on designing the RIS beamforming such that the signals received at the eavesdropper experience destructive interference. Compared to our previous work on multi-antenna wiretap channel with a multi-antenna helper, where active user cooperation enables/improves secure communication rates, here secure communication is enabled/improved by utilizing passive terminals (deployed at low cost).","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 17th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562156/9562133/09562188.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 17th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562133","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Communication in a Multi-antenna Wiretap Channel with a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","6G mobile communication","Costs","Upper bound","Transmitting antennas","Switches","Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["6G","Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)","Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Wiretap Channel","Secure Degrees of Freedom","Beamforming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Secure Communication in a Multi-antenna Wiretap Channel with a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562188/","publicationDate":"6 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Communication in a Multi-antenna Wiretap Channel with a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p400-nafea.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066538S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562156","isNumber":"9562133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562156","xplore-issue":"9562133","articleId":"9562188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9562194,"authors":[{"name":"Navaneetha C.

Indeed, with MIMO, the likelihood of simultaneous interruption of all optical beams is greatly reduced. For throughput improvement, many power loading strategies are obtained for a total power constraint while allowing power to be freely exchanged among light-emitting diodes (LEDs). In scenarios with unequal distances between LEDs and the user terminal, more power is allocated to the LED that has a better channel than to others. In practice, every optical front-end has its own power limitation and a per-LED power constraint is more meaningful than a total power constraint. This paper studies to what extent this has an impact on the performance of LED-based distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) OWC links. We formulate the achievable rate optimization problem for both cases, when the total power is constrained or when under a per-LED power constraint. Results show that, the achievable rate under a per-LED power constraint is lower than under a total power constraint, but it is higher than if the power is uniformly spread over the entire bandwidth. It also allows for transmit power saving, at a cost of higher computational complexity.

The settings considered here go beyond the total transmit power constraint and include a number of additional constraints, such as interference (cognitive radio) and energy-harvesting constraints, for which the feasible set is not isotropic anymore so that the standard tools of the analysis cannot be used. By closely examining optimal precoding for the information-bearing and AN signals, we identify a number of cases where it is optimal to transmit no artificial noise at all (so that all the transmit power goes to the information-bearing signal). These cases include a fixed (no fading) MIMO WTC with single eavesdropper (for which we give a direct matrix-theoretic proof using novel matrix inequalities), multi-eavesdropper (com-pound) degraded and reversely-degraded channels, and multi-eavesdropper channels where there exists a dominant eavesdropper (for which we give a precise definition) or when the eavesdroppers collude. To improve secrecy rates by using AN, one has to look elsewhere.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"To Jam or Not to Jam in Gaussian MIMO Wiretap Channels ?: Invited Paper","publicationTitle":"2021 17th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562204","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 17th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562156/9562133/09562204.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562133","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562204","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"To Jam or Not to Jam in Gaussian MIMO Wiretap Channels ?: Invited Paper","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562204/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","publicationDate":"6 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"To Jam or Not to Jam in Gaussian MIMO Wiretap Channels ?: Invited Paper","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p394-khojastehnia.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07454S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562156","isNumber":"9562133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562156","xplore-issue":"9562133","articleId":"9562204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9562215,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Rappaport","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Rappaport","id":"37086862119"},{"name":"Emre G\u00f6n\u00fclta\u015f","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"G\u00f6n\u00fclta\u015f","id":"37086458181"},{"name":"Jakob Hoydis","affiliation":["NVIDIA, France"],"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Hoydis","id":"37573341600"},{"name":"Maximilian Arnold","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Maximilian","lastName":"Arnold","id":"37086242214"},{"name":"Pavan Koteshwar Srinath","affiliation":["Nokia Bell Labs, France"],"firstName":"Pavan Koteshwar","lastName":"Srinath","id":"37088995090"},{"name":"Christoph Studer","affiliation":["ETH Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Studer","id":"38575411500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7432-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7433-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"9562215","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562215","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dimensionality reduction","Wireless communication","Base stations","Databases","Loss measurement","Stress"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562133","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 17th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","publicationTitle":"2021 17th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Channel Charting using a Split Triplet Loss and an Inertial Regularizer","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562156/9562133/09562215.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562215","abstract":"Channel charting is an emerging technology that enables self-supervised pseudo-localization of user equipments by performing dimensionality reduction on large channel-state information (CSI) databases that are passively collected at infrastructure base stations or access points.

As the evolution of cloud computing, mobile edge computing (MEC) sinks the computing and storage capacity from the centralized data center to the edge of the network, which is the key technology to achieve low delay and high speed. However, the traditional centralized scheme in small cell networks (SCNs) structure will bring huge signal overheads. In order to adapt to the complex and changeable network system, this paper proposes a distributed resource and power allocation scheme under MEC environment, which enables small base stations (SBSs) to work autonomously. The SBSs need only little information exchange through the information cloud (IC) and finally obtain the global optimal SE.

In order to address the extremely high attenuation at THz, ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) antenna systems have been proposed for THz communications to compensate propagation losses. Further, we propose a new group-of-subarrays (GoSA) UM-MIMO structure to reduce the hardware cost. We formulate the GoSA beamformer design as an optimization problem to provide a trade-off between the unconstrained communications beamformers and the desired radar beamformers. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional approaches in terms of spectral efficiency and hardware costs.","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562238","publicationTitle":"2021 17th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 17th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562156/9562133/09562238.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562133","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Beamforming for Terahertz Joint Ultra-Massive MIMO Radar-Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Beamforming for Terahertz Joint Ultra-Massive MIMO Radar-Communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562238/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"6 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9562238/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"ERC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Beamforming for Terahertz Joint Ultra-Massive MIMO Radar-Communications","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p332-elbir.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065941S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562156","isNumber":"9562133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562156","xplore-issue":"9562133","articleId":"9562238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9562245,"authors":[{"name":"Tsubasa Shobudani","affiliation":["Tokyo City University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsubasa","lastName":"Shobudani","id":"37087013428"},{"name":"Mamoru Sawahashi","affiliation":["Tokyo City University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Mamoru","lastName":"Sawahashi","id":"37269819300"},{"name":"Kenichi Higuchi","affiliation":["Tokyo University of Science, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenichi","lastName":"Higuchi","id":"37269866000"},{"name":"Yoshihisa Kishiyama","affiliation":["NTT DOCOMO INC., Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihisa","lastName":"Kishiyama","id":"37299879400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7432-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7433-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0225"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2154-0217"}],"articleNumber":"9562245","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"abstract":"This paper proposes faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling that assigns an increased amount of resources to parity bits in order to decrease the required received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that satisfies the target block error rate (BLER) for turbo-coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).

Via computer simulations, we show that Bob can successfully decode their own information in various user configurations and receiver diversities. It is also shown that the BER at Eve's side is increased to the 0.5-level for similar and the asymmetrical positioning of Bob with respect to the transmitter, thus PLS is ensured by the proposed preceding technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Precoding for Physical Layer Security of MIMO-NOMA-Based Visible Light Communications","publicationTitle":"2021 17th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","doi":"10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562248","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 17th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562156/9562133/09562248.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWCS49558.2021.9562248","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562133","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Precoding for Physical Layer Security of MIMO-NOMA-Based Visible Light Communications","conferenceDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562248/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","publicationDate":"6 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004410","fundingName":"Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)","grantNumber":"1003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000921","fundingName":"COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Precoding for Physical Layer Security of MIMO-NOMA-Based Visible Light Communications","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p158-su.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072396S","chronDate":"6-9 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562156","isNumber":"9562133","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562156","xplore-issue":"9562133","articleId":"9562248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9562263,"authors":[{"name":"Dingyou Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/9634701/9562263/ma-3118219-small.gif","p":["Dingyou Ma received the B.Sc. degree in aerospace science and technology from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2016.

An emerging approach to implementing DFRC systems is to embed information in radar waveforms via index modulation (IM). Implementation of DFRC schemes in vehicular systems gives rise to strict constraints in terms of cost, power efficiency, and hardware complexity. In this paper, we extend IM-based DFRC systems to utilizing sparse arrays and frequency modulated continuous waveforms (FMCWs), which are popular in automotive radar for their simplicity and low hardware complexity. The proposed FMCW-based radar-communications system (FRaC) operates at reduced cost and complexity by transmitting with a reduced number of radio frequency modules, combined with narrowband FMCW signalling. This is achieved via array sparsification in transmission, formulating a virtual multiple-input multiple-output array by combining the signals in one coherent processing interval, in which the narrowband waveforms are transmitted in a randomized manner. Performance analysis and numerical results show that the proposed radar scheme achieves similar resolution performance compared with a wideband radar system operating with a large receive aperture, while requiring less hardware overhead. For the communications subsystem, FRaC achieves higher rates and improved error rates compared to dual-function signalling based on conventional phase modulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FRaC: FMCW-Based Joint Radar-Communications System Via Index Modulation","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3118219","endPage":"1364","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/9634701/09562263.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","startPage":"1348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3118219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9634701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562263","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO communication","Radar antennas","Spaceborne radar","Phased arrays","Hardware","Costs","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automotive radar","dual function radar communications system","FMCW","Index modulation","MIMO radar"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FRaC: FMCW-Based Joint Radar-Communications System Via Index Modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562263/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","volume":"15","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/9562263/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801258 and 62171259"},{"fundingName":"European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program","grantNumber":"646804-ERC-COG-BNYQ"},{"fundingName":"Futurewei Technologies and from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-18-1-0208"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FRaC: FMCW-Based Joint Radar-Communications System Via Index Modulation","sourcePdf":"jstsp-huang-3118219-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109065S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"9634701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","xplore-issue":"9634701","articleId":"9562263","onlineDate":"06 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":9562280,"authors":[{"name":"Ziyang Cheng","affiliation":["School of Information & Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ziyang","lastName":"Cheng","orcid":"0000-0002-4498-2443"},{"name":"Zishu He","affiliation":["School of Information & Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zishu","lastName":"He","orcid":"0000-0003-4491-8414"},{"name":"Bin Liao","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Liao","orcid":"0000-0003-4636-4339"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-4553"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0484"}],"articleNumber":"9562280","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Radar","Radio frequency","Radar antennas","Wideband","Phase shifters","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM-DFRC","hybrid beamforming","multi-user","consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (consensus-ADMM)","finite resolution phase shifters"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Beamforming Design for OFDM Dual-Function Radar-Communication System","abstract":"Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) make efficient use of spectrum, while maintaining reliable robustness against multipath fading for communication and improved estimation accuracy for radar. Nevertheless, it would be costly to use a fully digital beamforming architecture, where each antenna is equipped with a radio frequency (RF) chain. This motivates us to consider hybrid beamforming for OFDM-DFRC system in this work. More specifically, the analog beamformer for the whole bandwidth and digital beamformer for each subcarrier are simultaneously designed, by jointly optimizing the spectral efficiency (SE) of communication and spatial spectrum matching error (SSME) of radar. To tackle the resulting optimization problem, a consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (consensus-ADMM) approach is devised. Further, in a practical sense, we consider the issue of hybrid transmit beamforming design with finite-resolution phase shifters, to facilitate economical implementation of the analog beamformer.

The goal is to maximize the output signal-to-interference-pulse-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver with a constant modulus constraint (CMC) on the transmit waveform. Assuming the multipath information to be known or partially known, we consider the waveform-filter design under two different cases. In the first case, the multipath information is exactly known. We devise \n<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Algorithm 1</b>\n to optimize the transmit waveform and receive filter alternatively. In the second case, the phase information of multipath reflection is unavailable. Under this situation, the minimax or robust waveform-filter design model is established; i.e., we maximize the worst-case SINR against the phase uncertainties. \n<bold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Algorithm 2</b>\n is proposed to solve the corresponding minimax optimization problem through alternating iterations. At each iteration, the closed form of optimal receive filter is derived, and waveform optimization is converted to a convex optimization problem through semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The Results demonstrate the superiority of the designed waveform-filter pair compared with some existing solutions.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562316","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","MIMO radar","Signal processing algorithms","Interference","Filtering algorithms","Information filters","Reflection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","multipath exploitation","waveform-filter design","SINR","minimax","worst case"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09562316.pdf","startPage":"5359","endPage":"5371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3112042","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3112042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Radar Waveform Design for Multipath Exploitation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562316/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Radar Waveform Design for Multipath Exploitation","isDynamicHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9562316/","volume":"69","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Radar Waveform Design for Multipath Exploitation","sourcePdf":"tsp-fan-3112042-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160825S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9562316","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":9562499,"authors":[{"name":"Talha Ahmed Khan","affiliation":["Jeju National University, Jeju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Talha","lastName":"Ahmed Khan","id":"37088995774"},{"name":"Khizar Abbas","affiliation":["Jeju National University, Jeju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Khizar","lastName":"Abbas","id":"37086399330"},{"name":"Javier Jose Diaz Rivera","affiliation":["Jeju National University, Jeju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Javier Jose","lastName":"Diaz Rivera","id":"37086413174"},{"name":"Afaq Muhammad","affiliation":["Jeju National University, Jeju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Afaq","lastName":"Muhammad","id":"37086184296"},{"name":"Wang-cheol Song","affiliation":["Jeju National University, Jeju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wang-cheol","lastName":"Song","id":"37671173100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-332-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3174-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2576-8565"}],"articleNumber":"9562499","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Automation","Software algorithms","Machine learning","Manuals","Quality of service","Predictive models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IBN","5G","OSM","KOREN","ML","SDN and Route-Net"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562499","abstract":"The expansion of infrastructure and services in the 5th generation networks resulted in complex configuration management throughout the network lifecycle. To this end, network automation replaces existing traditional manual administrative approaches with software-driven repetitive and reliable applications. Since network expansion is in multiple dimensions, including multi-services, domains, and platforms, it is challenging to resolve such a vast infrastructure through a single automation solution. Hence this paper proposed applying an intent-based solution for achieving automatic orchestration for vastly spreading network services. Intent-based solution not only considers network automation but also performs service assurance throughout the network service lifecycle. The proposed IBN (Intent-Based Networking) solution implements a closed-loop network lifecycle management using a single abstracted software platform. It translates high-level requirements to the infrastructure irrespective of the various underlying platforms and domains, and it includes intelligence-driven monitoring and updates for service assurance. A multi-model machine learning approach is proposed in this work to control the network infrastructure reliably. To this end LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithm is applied for compute-resource prediction and the Route-Net model for optimized service path routing. The infrastructure includes FlexRAN deployed as the access network controller, OSM (OpenSource MANO) resides at the core, and the KOREN network serves as a high-speed transport network.","doi":"10.23919/APNOMS52696.2021.9562499","startPage":"254","endPage":"257","publicationTitle":"2021 22nd Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/APNOMS52696.2021.9562499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562494","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 22nd Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562493/9562494/09562499.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying RouteNet and LSTM to Achieve Network Automation: An Intent-based Networking Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562499/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Applying RouteNet and LSTM to Achieve Network Automation: An Intent-based Networking Approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562499/","publicationDate":"8 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"NRF-2016R1D1A1B01 016322"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying RouteNet and LSTM to Achieve Network Automation: An Intent-based Networking Approach","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p254-khan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0551S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562493","isNumber":"9562494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562493","xplore-issue":"9562494","articleId":"9562499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":9562513,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Valls","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicaciones y Aplicaciones Multimedia, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9562513/valls-3118544-small.gif","p":["Javier Valls received the degree in telecommunication engineering from the Universidad Politecnica de Catalunya, in 1993, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunication engineering from the Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Spain, in 1999.

To reduce the logical error rate of the quantum systems, the use of error correction codes and decoders has been established as a low-cost and feasible approach, with good results from a theoretical perspective, for mid and long-term architectures. While most of the authors are focused on the algorithms to improve the correction capability of quantum computers, without taking into account a fundamental implementation aspect for their deployment in a real system, \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">i.e.</i>\n, their latency must be bounded to avoid the qubit decoherence, only a few propose hardware architectures and they just include time estimations of their decoding latency. However, a real implementation has not been shown yet. In this work, we analyze from the point of view of hardware implementation two algorithmic options based on quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes: a) belief propagation min-sum decoders combined with codes with good error-floor behavior and b) belief propagation min-sum decoders concatenated with ordered statistics decoders (OSDs) for codes with early error-floor. The bounds for the maximum clock frequency required by the decoders to decode within the qubit coherence time are established as a parameter to show if a practical implementation is possible with the present or near future FPGA technology. Furthermore, real implementation results for a Xilinx FPGA device are provided, showing that some solutions can meet the timing constraints set up by the state-of-the-art quantum processors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Syndrome-Based Min-Sum vs OSD-0 Decoders: FPGA Implementation and Analysis for Quantum LDPC Codes","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118544","startPage":"138734","endPage":"138743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09562513.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562513","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Syndrome-Based Min-Sum vs OSD-0 Decoders: FPGA Implementation and Analysis for Quantum LDPC Codes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9562513/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1855879, CCSS-2027844, CCSS-2052751 and NS-FERC 1941583"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Syndrome-Based Min-Sum vs OSD-0 Decoders: FPGA Implementation and Analysis for Quantum LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"access-valls-3118544-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092683S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9562513","onlineDate":"06 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":9562525,"authors":[{"name":"Shaojun Zou","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China","School of Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics, Changsha University, Changsha, China","Hunan Province Key Laboratory of Industrial Internet Technology and Security, Changsha University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9653733/9562525/zou-3118467-small.gif","p":["Shaojun Zou (Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Central South University, China.

Various fine-grained load balancing schemes have been proposed to split flows across multiple paths. However, data center networks suffer from many uncertainties such as highly dynamic traffic. These uncertainties easily make network become asymmetric, resulting in significant packet reordering. Unfortunately, existing solutions passively deal with packet reordering based on a threshold and hardly adapt to asymmetric networks because of lacking the explicit reordering feedback. These solutions either fail to quickly respond to packet loss or cause unnecessary fast retransmission, which reduces link utilization and increases flow completion time. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained load balancing scheme RMC to eliminate the impact of packet reordering and handle uncertainties in asymmetric networks. To avoid unnecessary fast retransmission, the switch proactively identifies reordered packet according to local queue length and global path latency. Furthermore, we employ a coding technique with redundancy optimization to reduce long-tailed flow completion time under network asymmetry. Through a series of large-scale NS2 simulations and testbed experiments, we demonstrate that RMC effectively avoids unnecessary fast retransmission under different network scenarios and reduces flow completion time by up to 72% compared with state-of-the-art schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562525/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"69","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9562525/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"RMC: Reordering Marking and Coding for Fine-Grained Load Balancing in Data Centers","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62102047, 62132022, 61872387 and 61872403"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004735","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China","grantNumber":"2021JJ30867"},{"fundingName":"Project of Foreign Cultural and Educational Expert","grantNumber":"G20190018003"},{"fundingName":"the Hunan Province Key Laboratory of Industrial Internet Technology and Security","grantNumber":"2019TP1011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RMC: Reordering Marking and Coding for Fine-Grained Load Balancing in Data Centers","sourcePdf":"tcomm-huang-3118467-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064685S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9653733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9653733","articleId":"9562525","onlineDate":"06 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9562531,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Amine Ferrag","affiliation":["Guelma University, Algeria, Algeria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9562531/ferra-3118642-small.gif","p":["Mohamed Amine Ferrag received the bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, Ph.D., and Habilitation degrees in computer science from Badji Mokhtar-Annaba University, Annaba, Algeria, in June 2008, June 2010, June 2014, and April 2019, respectively.","Since October 2014, he has been a Senior Lecturer with the Department of Computer Science, Guelma University, Guelma, Algeria.

Specifically, we first provide a review of the federated learning-based security and privacy systems for several types of IoT applications, including, Industrial IoT, Edge Computing, Internet of Drones, Internet of Healthcare Things, Internet of Vehicles, etc. Second, the use of federated learning with blockchain and malware/intrusion detection systems for IoT applications is discussed. Then, we review the vulnerabilities in federated learning-based security and privacy systems. Finally, we provide an experimental analysis of federated deep learning with three deep learning approaches, namely, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). For each deep learning model, we study the performance of centralized and federated learning under three new real IoT traffic datasets, namely, the Bot-IoT dataset, the MQTTset dataset, and the TON_IoT dataset. The goal of this article is to provide important information on federated deep learning approaches with emerging technologies for cyber security. In addition, it demonstrates that federated deep learning approaches outperform the classic/centralized versions of machine learning (non-federated learning) in assuring the privacy of IoT device data and provide the higher accuracy in detecting attacks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9562531/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21176498","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Federated Deep Learning for Cyber Security in the Internet of Things: Concepts, Applications, and Experimental Analysis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001798","fundingName":"Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre (CSCRC) and Edith Cowan University, Australia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Federated Deep Learning for Cyber Security in the Internet of Things: Concepts, Applications, and Experimental Analysis","sourcePdf":"access-ferrag-3118642-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.314157S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9562531","onlineDate":"06 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9562533,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Xiao","affiliation":["UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Shanghai Branch, Ericsson (China) Communications Company Ltd., Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Xiao","orcid":"0000-0003-1478-120X"},{"name":"Deepak Mishra","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Mishra","orcid":"0000-0002-3225-6495"},{"name":"Jinhong Yuan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jinhong","lastName":"Yuan","orcid":"0000-0002-5794-493X"},{"name":"Yuyue Luo","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Yuyue","lastName":"Luo","orcid":"0000-0002-1994-2650"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9562533","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"We study the proportionally fair beamforming design for the downlink channel of multibeam satellite systems. Due to the channel phase uncertainty caused by oscillators and the long round trip delay, the beamforming design needs to be robust to the imperfect channel state information (CSI). We formulate an optimization problem with outage probability and per-antenna power constraints to maximize the weighted sum utility of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR) threshold to realize proportional fairness. The optimization problem is non-convex and we transformed it into the convex form through accurate approximation. We solve the optimization problem via a proposed sub-optimal algorithm. The simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm can converge within 30 iterations when the number of beams is 9. Furthermore, the proposed beamforming scheme obtains a 10% average performance gain in weighted sum utility over the robust max-min schemes in different levels of phase uncertainty.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Satellites","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Power system reliability","Uncertainty","Resource management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multibeam satellite systems","beamforming","convex optimization","proportional fairness","robustness"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3118567","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09562533.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3118567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proportionally Fair Robust Beamforming for Multicast Multibeam Satellite Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Proportionally Fair Robust Beamforming for Multicast Multibeam Satellite Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562533/","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9562533/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proportionally Fair Robust Beamforming for Multicast Multibeam Satellite Systems","sourcePdf":"lcomm-xiao-3118567-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059205S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9562533","onlineDate":"06 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9562535,"authors":[{"name":"Suzan Hajj","affiliation":["ImViA, Universit\u00e9 de Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9, Dijon, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9562535/hajj-3118605-small.gif","p":["Suzan Hajj received the master\u2019s degree in engineering from Lebanese University, in 2000.

Fast processing of traffic data and early warnings on the detected attacks are required while maintaining a single pass over the traffic measurements. To alleviate these problems, one can reduce the amount of traffic to be processed using a sampling technique and detect the attacks based on the sampled traffic. Different parameters have an impact on the efficiency of this process, mainly the applied sampling policy and sampling ratio. In this study, we investigate the statistical impact of sampling network traffic and quantify the amount of deterioration that the sampling process introduces. In this context, an experimental comparison of existing sampling techniques is performed based on their impact on several well-known statistical measures.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118605","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09562535.pdf","startPage":"138903","endPage":"138938","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Critical Review on the Implementation of Static Data Sampling Techniques to Detect Network Attacks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"A Critical Review on the Implementation of Static Data Sampling Techniques to Detect Network Attacks","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9562535/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","accessionNumber":"21176483","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562535/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Critical Review on the Implementation of Static Data Sampling Techniques to Detect Network Attacks","sourcePdf":"access-elsibai-3118605-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.228424S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9562535","onlineDate":"06 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9562539,"authors":[{"name":"Yanglong Sun","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9562539/sun-3118539-small.gif","p":["Yanglong Sun (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Zhengzhou University, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

However, controlling the uplink transmission power brings extra signaling overhead, especially in dynamic environments. In this paper, we investigate the uplink transmission power allocation problem in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided platooning NOMA system, where the UAV acts as a relay to assist inter-vehicle communications. Platoon vehicles are admitted to the same vehicle-to-UAV channel via our proposed sequence-based power allocation (SPA) strategy. Instead of achieving the optimal energy efficiency, our goal is to design a simple yet effective power control scheme. Specially, in SPA strategy, vehicles determine their transmission power according to their positions in the platoon. Considering platoon dynamics due to vehicle mobility, a power-reserved mechanism is further incorporated in the proposed strategy to pre-allocate power resources for newly joined vehicles. In addition, a power-moving mechanism is further employed to guarantee the uplink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of vehicles by changing vehicle transmission power into higher levels during vehicle leaving a platoon. As the system only needs to update vehicle positions for the SPA strategy, only a small amount of signaling is required in our power allocation strategy. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed SPA strategy ensures the required SINR of platoon communication in different dynamic scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118539","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09562539.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","startPage":"139473","endPage":"139488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control Efficient Power Allocation of Uplink NOMA in UAV-Aided Vehicular Platooning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control Efficient Power Allocation of Uplink NOMA in UAV-Aided Vehicular Platooning","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562539/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9562539/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61731012, 61801409 and 91638204"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Control Efficient Power Allocation of Uplink NOMA in UAV-Aided Vehicular Platooning","sourcePdf":"access-sun-3118539-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118152S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9562539","onlineDate":"06 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":9562552,"authors":[{"name":"Shuaibing Li","affiliation":["School of New Energy and Power Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/9259274/9562552/li-3117360-small.gif","p":["Shuaibing Li (Member, IEEE) was born in Gansu, China, in 1989.

This article proposes a nonintrusive method for moisture inspection of multilayer insulation structure based on terahertz (THz) technology with a focus on the cable terminal of the electric multiple units (EMUs). First, a three-layer scattering model is established based on the actual structure of the composite cable terminal, and theoretical analysis is performed to reveal the potential application mechanism. Based on that, an artificial model of a three-layer structure is then built on which the insulation damp test is carried out. Finally, the THz spectrum and THz imaging tests are performed. Results show that the frequency-domain signal can effectively identify the moisture inside the multilayer composited insulation. The imaging results in the frequency domain of the sample can accurately determine the geometric parameters of the damp area. By further analyzing the time-domain spectroscopy, the thickness of insulation affected by moisture can be identified quantitatively. This article verifies the feasibility of THz technology in inspecting the moisture dampness of multilayer composite insulation and its potential application in the damp condition assessment of EMU cable terminals.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2021.3117360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2021.3117360","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/9259274/09562552.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9259274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonintrusive Inspection of Moisture Damp in Composited Insulation Structure Based on Terahertz Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Nonintrusive Inspection of Moisture Damp in Composited Insulation Structure Based on Terahertz Technology","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","externalId":"6011110","volume":"70","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562552/","accessionNumber":"21176018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562552/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009014","fundingName":"Tianyou Youth Talent Lift Program of Lanzhou Jiaotong University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"52167018"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonintrusive Inspection of Moisture Damp in Composited Insulation Structure Based on Terahertz Technology","sourcePdf":"tim-li-3117360-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089515S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9562552","onlineDate":"06 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9562590,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo Guo","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kuo","lastName":"Guo","id":"37088995418"},{"name":"Jia Chen","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Chen","id":"37965404800"},{"name":"Ping Dong","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Dong","id":"37397265000"},{"name":"Yu Zhao","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37086662207"},{"name":"Deyun Gao","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Deyun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37276085100"},{"name":"Shang Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37088994610"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-332-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3174-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2576-8565"}],"articleNumber":"9562590","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562590","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Service function chaining","Prototypes","Bandwidth","Hardware","Software","Network function virtualization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network function virtualization","service function chain","collaborated detection","programmable data plane","deep learning"]}],"abstract":"Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is one of the most promising technologies which decouples Network Functions (NFs) from hardware resources to support more flexible network services and network resource allocation. However, these benefits increase the possibility of Service Function Chain (SFC) failures due to hardware failures, software defects and burst traffic, resulting in serious consequences. Unfortunately, existing failure detection methods have several issues, such as simplification of detection functionality, heavy overhead, and low accuracy. This paper introduces a framework FullSight, in which control plane and the programmable data plane can collaboratively detect failure and Deep Learning (DL) based algorithms are adopted for failure detection. FullSight can achieve an all-round perception of the state of the SFC, in which network information is acquired through the data plane, SFC components' message is obtained through the control plane. In addition, a failure detection model based on DL is established. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, FullSight can support 8 kinds of the fine-grained failure detection. Our comprehensive evaluation of prototypes and simulations shows that FullSight can realize rapid and accurate detection and classification of diversified failures in SFCs. The bandwidth overhead reduces by 57% compared with the existing methods.

We analyze and study the impact of an eavesdropper located in an underlay cooperative cognitive radio network (CRN). A reconfigurable intelligent surface is used to improve the secrecy outage probability of the proposed system. CRs resolve spectrum scarcity by enabling spectrum sharing. On the other hand, RIS is a planar surface device equipped with signal enhancing reflecting elements that enhance signals at desired users and suppress signal power at undesired eavesdroppers in PLS networks. Therefore, the integration of RIS in cooperative underlay CR networks can enable secure wireless communications. To this end, we derive closed-form secrecy outage probability (SOP) expressions for a network that consists of a primary destination, secondary source, secondary user and a passive eavesdropper. The obtained equations are verified via simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 22nd Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562493/9562494/09562609.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"2021 22nd Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","doi":"10.23919/APNOMS52696.2021.9562609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/APNOMS52696.2021.9562609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562494","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy Outage Probability of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Cooperative Underlay Cognitive Radio Network Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart cities","Wireless networks","Probability","Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces","Physical layer security","Mathematical models","Power system reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Secrecy outage probability (SOP)","Cognitive radio (CR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Outage Probability of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Cooperative Underlay Cognitive Radio Network Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562609/","publicationDate":"8 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy Outage Probability of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Cooperative Underlay Cognitive Radio Network Communications","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p73-le.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076718S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562493","isNumber":"9562494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562493","xplore-issue":"9562494","articleId":"9562609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9562610,"authors":[{"name":"Siyu QI","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Siyu","lastName":"QI","id":"37088994313"},{"name":"Shuopeng LI","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuopeng","lastName":"LI","id":"37085991628"},{"name":"Shaofu LIN","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaofu","lastName":"LIN","id":"37086441109"},{"name":"Mohand Yazid SAIDI","affiliation":["L2TL Institut Galilee, University Sorbonne Paris Nord, Villetaneuse, France"],"firstName":"Mohand Yazid","lastName":"SAIDI","id":"37670691800"},{"name":"Ken CHEN","affiliation":["L2TL Institut Galilee, University Sorbonne Paris Nord, Villetaneuse, France"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"CHEN","id":"37278250400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-332-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3174-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2576-8565"}],"articleNumber":"9562610","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Energy consumption","Service function chaining","Reinforcement learning","Transforms","Graph neural networks","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network Function Virtualization","Service Function Chaining","Virtual Network Function","Graph Neural Network","Deep Reinforcement Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562610","abstract":"Network Function Virtualization (NFV), which decouples network functions from hardware and transforms them into hardware-independent Virtual Network Functions (VNF), is a crucial technology for many emerging networking domains, such as 5G, edge computing and data-center network. Service Function Chaining (SFC) is the ordered set of VNFs. The VNF deployment problem is to find the optimal deployment strategy of VNFs in SFC while guaranteeing the Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). Existing VNF deployment researches mainly focus on sequences of VNFs without energy consideration. However, with the rapid development of application requirement, the SFCs evolve from sequence to dynamic graph and the service providers become more and more sensitive to the energy consumption in NFV. Therefore, in this paper, we identify the Energy-efficient Graph-structured SFC problem (EG-SFC) and formulate it as a Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). Benefiting from the recent advances in machine learning for COP, we propose an end-to-end Graph Neural Network (GNN) based on constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to solve EG-SFC. Our method leverages the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to represent the Q-network of Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) in DRL. The mask mechanism is proposed to deal with the resources constraints in COP. The experimental results show that the proposed method can deal with unseen SFC graphs and achieve better performances than greedy algorithm and traditional DDQN.","doi":"10.23919/APNOMS52696.2021.9562610","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562493/9562494/09562610.pdf","startPage":"348","endPage":"353","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 22nd Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","publicationTitle":"2021 22nd Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/APNOMS52696.2021.9562610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient VNF Deployment for Graph-Structured SFC Based on Graph Neural Network and Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562610/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient VNF Deployment for Graph-Structured SFC Based on Graph Neural Network and Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","publicationDate":"8 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9562610/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFF0305400"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient VNF Deployment for Graph-Structured SFC Based on Graph Neural Network and Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p348-qi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056328S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562493","isNumber":"9562494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562493","xplore-issue":"9562494","articleId":"9562610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9562646,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, PR, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088994396"},{"name":"Wei Su","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, PR, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Su","id":"37290379500"},{"name":"Lizhuang Tan","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, PR, China"],"firstName":"Lizhuang","lastName":"Tan","id":"37086694520"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-332-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3174-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2576-8565"}],"articleNumber":"9562646","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telemetry","Task analysis","Optimization","Monitoring","Business"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["In-band Network Telemetry","Network Monitoring","Multi-objective Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562646","abstract":"In-band network telemetry task orchestration is to study how to reasonably select business flows to carry in-band network telemetry tasks to cover all necessary switches and ports.

The non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technique proved to be efficient enough to overcome the fading issues if utilized efficiently. Since the signals transmitted in NOMA are superimposed, with the help of Channel State Information (CSI), the Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) technique is applied to separate each user's signal. A lot of researches have been going on to study the performance of the NOMA system in various fading channels such as Nakagami-m channel distribution, Rayleigh channel distribution, Rician fading channel distribution, etc. Very few studies were conducted on Weibull-channel distribution applied in the NOMA network. This letter studies performance of the Weibull-channel fading distribution applied in the NOMA network in presence of two users and the presence of a bi-directional communication link between the devices. The analytical expressions were obtained to study the performance efficiency of the system and extensive simulations were generated comparing the performance in various parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On The Performance of NOMA with Bi-directional in Weibull-Channel","publicationTitle":"2021 22nd Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","doi":"10.23919/APNOMS52696.2021.9562653","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 22nd Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562493/9562494/09562653.pdf","startPage":"362","endPage":"365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/APNOMS52696.2021.9562653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562494","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"On The Performance of NOMA with Bi-directional in Weibull-Channel","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562653/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","publicationDate":"8 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On The Performance of NOMA with Bi-directional in Weibull-Channel","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p362-tong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07069S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562493","isNumber":"9562494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562493","xplore-issue":"9562494","articleId":"9562653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9562657,"authors":[{"name":"Ya-Ting Yang","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan","National Taiwan University"],"firstName":"Ya-Ting","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088995486"},{"name":"Hung-Yu Wei","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan","National Taiwan University"],"firstName":"Hung-Yu","lastName":"Wei","id":"37281361800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-332-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3174-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2576-8565"}],"articleNumber":"9562657","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Edge Computing and Networking Resource Management for Decomposable Deep Learning: An Auction-Based Approach","abstract":"With the rapid growth in the demand for internet-of-things (IoT) systems such as factory of future, smart home, smart city, long-term healthcare, deep learning (DL) applications have attracted significant attention from people. However, it is challenging to inference such tasks on computational limited IoT devices due to the massive computational requirements of DL models. The conventional solution is to deliver data collected from IoT devices to remote cloud for computation, while this may not only rely heavily on networking resources but also cause security risks. The rising concept of edge computing gives us another solution. Tasks can be decomposed by different scales. Model-level decomposition is to inference the models in the task pipeline on different computing devices, while layer-level decomposition is to inference the layers in the single DL model on different computing devices. Both scales of decomposition can be inferenced on edge-cloud framework or simply device-edge framework based on different considerations. This would lead to several aspects of management: resource management for both networking resources and computing resources as well as application configuration management. In this work, we first design configuration tables for different application tasks, with different choices of DL models, different parameter settings, and different layer-level partition points, then we apply Vick-rey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction to allocate both networking and computing resources by assigning each IoT device a proper configuration. We also show some desired properties such as truthfulness of the mechanism and observe that the VCG truly utilizes both resources better.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Smart cities","Computational modeling","Smart homes","Medical services","Production facilities","Resource management"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562657","doi":"10.23919/APNOMS52696.2021.9562657","startPage":"108","endPage":"113","publicationTitle":"2021 22nd Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 22nd Asia-Pacific Network Operations and Management Symposium (APNOMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562493/9562494/09562657.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/APNOMS52696.2021.9562657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562657/","displayDocTitle":"Edge Computing and Networking Resource Management for Decomposable Deep Learning: An Auction-Based Approach","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"8 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9562657/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge Computing and Networking Resource Management for Decomposable Deep Learning: An Auction-Based Approach","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p108-yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09561S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562493","isNumber":"9562494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562493","xplore-issue":"9562494","articleId":"9562657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9562678,"authors":[{"name":"Kunyi Xie","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kunyi","lastName":"Xie","id":"37088931144"},{"name":"Yang Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085345049"},{"name":"Lei Feng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Feng","id":"37085481774"},{"name":"Wenjing Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenjing","lastName":"Li","id":"37537039200"},{"name":"Jing Shen","affiliation":["State Grid Henan Electric Power Company, Information and Communication Company, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Shen","id":"37088489307"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-332-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3174-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2576-8565"}],"articleNumber":"9562678","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Simulation","Heuristic algorithms","Games","Throughput","Energy efficiency","Resource management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless communication","intelligent reflecting surface","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is advanced as an effective technology to meet the high requirements of frequency spectrum and energy efficiency (EE) in future wireless communication systems, which can dynamically adjust its reflecting elements to control the incident signal and change the signal transmission path, thus improve the channel transmission environment.

This paper investigates an uplink wireless communication system with single IRS serving multiple cells with multiple users (UEs). The transmit power of users and the phase shifts of IRS are jointly optimized for maximizing the system throughput.

As existing network resource management policies are not sophisticated enough to cope with network conditions that change constantly, resource utilization can be lowered and costs can be higher. With the recent advances in deep learning techniques, network operators can manage networks intelligently. For the intelligent network, there is a technique which predict the state of network links. However, when the scale of the network increases, overall network management can be complicated. In addition, as the models of link state prediction are affected by the states of adjacent links, it is necessary to consider the spatio-temporal characteristics between links. In this paper, we propose a GCN(Graph Convolutional Neural Network)-GRU(Gated Recurrent Unit) based link state prediction technique. The proposed GCN-GRU model predicts network traffic by considering the spatio-temporal characteristics of each link state such as bandwidth, delay, and packet loss rate. Through extensive experiments on actual network traffic, the proposed GCN-GRU based link state prediction technique has shown to achieve 1.5% lower a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to a LSTM (Long Short term Memory) based link state prediction technique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562682/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562682/","publicationDate":"8 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Graph Convolutional Network based Link State Prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph Convolutional Network based Link State Prediction","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"p246-yeom.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051026S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562493","isNumber":"9562494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562493","xplore-issue":"9562494","articleId":"9562682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9562750,"authors":[{"name":"Anders E.

This dependence is especially acute at the high carrier frequencies used by mmWave and THz systems, where the links are susceptible to blockages. Predicting blockages with high reliability requires a large number of data samples to train effective machine learning modules. With the aim of mitigating data requirements, we introduce a framework based on \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">meta-learning</i>\n, whereby data from distinct deployments are leveraged to optimize a shared initialization that decreases the data set size necessary for any new deployment. Predictors of two different events are studied: (1) at least one blockage occurs in a time window, and (2) the link is blocked for the entire time window. The results show that an RNN-based predictor trained using meta-learning is able to predict blockages after observing fewer samples than predictors trained using standard methods.","doi":"10.1109/LWC.2021.3118269","startPage":"2815","endPage":"2819","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LWC.2021.3118269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9642026","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/9642026/09562750.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of mmWave/THz Link Blockages Through Meta-Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562750/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction of mmWave/THz Link Blockages Through Meta-Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks","volume":"10","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9562750/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 October 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004836","fundingName":"Danish Council for Independent Research under Grant 8022-00284B (SEMIOTIC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of mmWave/THz Link Blockages Through Meta-Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"lwc-kalr-3118269-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060538S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"9642026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","xplore-issue":"9642026","articleId":"9562750","onlineDate":"07 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":9562798,"authors":[{"name":"Enoch S.

The HIV-1 accessory protein Nef, demonstrates considerable genetic variability and several studies suggest that Nef variation is associated with disease progression. Here we use an evolved neural network approach applied to a well-curated database of HIV-1 Nef sequences from subtypes A1, C, and D, the most prominent subtypes in Uganda, Africa to elucidate functional properties associated with subtype diversity. Following the generation of over 1000 features associated with amino acids physicochemical properties, we use statistical pruning and evolved neural networks to identify key Nef features associated with subtype differentiation.

Through sensors and actuators, ECUs maintain critical vehicle functions such as transmission and engine control. However, security was never a part of CAN design and hence ECUs are susceptible to a wide range of attacks. Thus, in recent years, several anomaly detection systems have been proposed for the CAN bus in order to detect anomalies caused by adversarial attacks or misbehaving sensors. These systems generally try to detect deviations from individual sensor's expected behavior. As such, they are ineffective against attacks that target multiple sensors to accomplish a collective desired behavior without changing the expected behavior of each individual sensor. In this paper, we focus on detecting such attacks by identifying contextual CAN anomalies in realtime. To this end, we present NeuroCAN, a deep learning-based detection system that utilizes Linear embeddings and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units to learn the spatio-temporal correlations among sensor data on the CAN bus at a frame level. By exploiting such correlations, NeuroCAN is able to detect contextual anomalies that are otherwise difficult to detect by analyzing individual sensor data. We evaluate NeuroCAN using two publicly available CAN datasets and compare it against existing approaches. Our results show that NeuroCAN achieves over 95% detection accuracy and performs significantly better than the existing baselines.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NeuroCAN: Contextual Anomaly Detection in Controller Area Networks","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2)","doi":"10.1109/ISC253183.2021.9562830","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562741/9562768/09562830.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISC253183.2021.9562830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"NeuroCAN: Contextual Anomaly Detection in Controller Area Networks","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562830/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","publicationDate":"7 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009192","fundingName":"Alberta Innovates"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NeuroCAN: Contextual Anomaly Detection in Controller Area Networks","confLoc":"Manchester, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"1570734437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111997S","chronDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562741","isNumber":"9562768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562741","xplore-issue":"9562768","articleId":"9562830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9562868,"authors":[{"name":"Immanuel Jose C.

Accurate and efficient crowd density estimation is critical to monitor crowd status for developing evacuation strategies. The existing crowd density estimation methods are established based on complex deep-learning algorithms which are usually more accurate, but, on the other side, they require much more computational resources. Consequently, cloud-computing is the only option for deploying crowd density estimation algorithms, which needs tremendous resources for real-time video data transmission and the malfunction and delay of internet service may cause wrong and delayed estimation results. Edge computing is a novel concept of accomplishing computing tasks only relying on the computational resources of edge devices. Estimating crowd density on edge devices rather than conveying images to cloud server for further analysis has several advantages, including 1) reducing network bandwidth pressure from remote transmission; 2) avoiding risks of leaking privacy on images; and 3) improving computation efficient. This study designs an edge computing-enabled crowd density estimation model based on the residual bottleneck block and dilated convolution. The experiments are designed and conducted on public crowd data sets to verify accuracy, storage cost and computation efficiency of our model. According to the experimental results, the proposed model achieves a considerable improvement in operational efficiency, while keep the accuracy at the same level with the complex deep-learning algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed model is implemented on a real edge device to detect real-world crowd density in a Beijing subway station.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562877/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562877/","publicationDate":"7 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Edge Computing-Enabled Crowd Density Estimation based on Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key RD Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1601600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"30918012204"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Edge Computing-Enabled Crowd Density Estimation based on Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network","confLoc":"Manchester, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"1570731889.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07747S","chronDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562741","isNumber":"9562768","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562741","xplore-issue":"9562768","articleId":"9562877","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":9562890,"authors":[{"name":"Surbhi Gupta","affiliation":["SMVDU, J&K, India"],"firstName":"Surbhi","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37088997063"},{"name":"Manoj Gupta","affiliation":["SMVDU, J&K, India"],"firstName":"Manoj","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37087412639"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0112-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0113-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9562890","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"abstract":"Cancer is one of the most significant causes of death worldwide, accounting for millions of deaths each year. The fatality rate of cancer is getting higher. Over the last three decades, deep neural networks have been critical in cancer research.

In this study, we have proposed a unique ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet) for segmenting gliomas from MR images. Two fully linked ConvNets constituted the ensemble model (2D-ConvNet and 3-D ConvNet). The novel model is validated against a single dataset from the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, specifically BraTS_2018. The prediction results obtained using the proposed methodology on the BraTS_2018 datasets demonstrate the suggested architecture's efficiency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Image segmentation","Solid modeling","Computational modeling","Biological system modeling","Computer architecture","Brain modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cancer","convolutional neural network","deep neural networks","ensemble learning","segmentation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIBCB49929.2021.9562890","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562742/9562772/09562890.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB49929.2021.9562890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation using Magnetic Resonance Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation using Magnetic Resonance Images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562890/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9562890/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation using Magnetic Resonance Images","confLoc":"Melbourne, Australia","sourcePdf":"paper_57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065133S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562742","isNumber":"9562772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562742","xplore-issue":"9562772","articleId":"9562890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9562906,"authors":[{"name":"Gulustan Dogan","affiliation":["University of North Carolina Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina, USA"],"firstName":"Gulustan","lastName":"Dogan","id":"38070229700"},{"name":"Sinem Sena Ertas","affiliation":["Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sinem Sena","lastName":"Ertas","id":"37088633896"},{"name":"\u0130remnaz Cay","affiliation":["Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u0130remnaz","lastName":"Cay","id":"37088635691"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0112-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0113-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9562906","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accelerometers","Magnetometers","Magnetic sensors","Computational modeling","Biological system modeling","Activity recognition","Sensors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Human Activity Recognition","Deep Learning","Convolutional Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9562906","abstract":"Using smartphone sensors to recognize human activity may be advantageous due to the abundant volume of data that can be obtained. In this paper, we propose a sensor data based deep learning approach for recognizing human activity. Our proposed recognition method uses linear accelerometer (LAcc), gyroscope (Gyr), and magnetometer (Mag) sensors to perceive eight transportation and locomotion activities. The eight activities include: Still, Walk, Run, Bike, Bus, Car, Train, and Subway. In this study, the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion (SHL) Dataset of three participants are used to recognize the physical activities of the users. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectrograms generated from the three axes of the LAcc, Gyr, and Mag sensor data are used as input data for our proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Experimental results on the task of human activity recognition demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed user-independent approach over that of competitive baselines.","doi":"10.1109/CIBCB49929.2021.9562906","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIBCB49929.2021.9562906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9562772","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9562742/9562772/09562906.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human Activity Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9562906/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Human Activity Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9562906/","publicationDate":"13 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human Activity Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Melbourne, Australia","sourcePdf":"paper_23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054701S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9562742","isNumber":"9562772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9562742","xplore-issue":"9562772","articleId":"9562906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":9562953,"authors":[{"name":"Khalid J Almalki","affiliation":["School of Computing and Engineering University of Missouri-Kansas, City MO, USA","College of Computing and Informatics Saudi Electronic University Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Khalid J","lastName":"Almalki","id":"37086695210"},{"name":"Muhammad Mohzary","affiliation":["School of Computing and Engineering University of Missouri-Kansas, City MO, USA","Jazan University, Jazan, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Mohzary","id":"37088903478"},{"name":"Baek-Young Choi","affiliation":["School of Computing and Engineering University of Missouri-Kansas, City MO, USA"],"firstName":"Baek-Young","lastName":"Choi","id":"37279181300"},{"name":"Sejun Song","affiliation":["School of Computing and Engineering University of Missouri-Kansas, City MO, USA"],"firstName":"Sejun","lastName":"Song","id":"37085365549"},{"name":"Yu Chen","affiliation":["Binghamton University, SUNY Binghamton, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37407070200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4919-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4920-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2687-8860"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2687-8852"}],"articleNumber":"9562953","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Pandemics","Machine learning","Human factors","Social factors","Safety","Trajectory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["COVID-19","Mask-wearing","Social Distancing","Machine Learning"]}],"abstract":"In addition to rapid vaccination, predicting possible trajectories of the COVID-19 pandemic is critical to health-care-related policy decisions and infrastructure planning. Growing evidence shows that face masks and social distancing can considerably reduce the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19. However, the current pandemic trajectory predictions take overly simplified policy input rather than actual observations of face masks and social distancing practices in a crowd. Thus, it is crucial to monitor and understand the extent of masking practices and assess the safety level in a scalable manner. This paper proposes a novel face masking detection system for Modeling Safety Index in Crowd (Mosaic), a Machine Learning (ML)-based approach for detecting masking in a crowd by building new dense mode crowd mask datasets. Mosaic detects, counts, and classifies the crowd's masking condition and calculates spatiotemporal Safety Index (SI) values for each community instead of detecting individual masking cases. SI data can be shared or published to calculate the area-based SI maps (as opt-in data) for assisting effective policy decisions and relief plans against COVID-19. The experimental results show that Mosaic detects various conditions and types of masking states and calculates SI values of a crowd effectively.

natural language processing (NLP) models have become more complex and bigger to provide more sophisticated NLP services. Accordingly, there is also a strong demand for scalable and flexible computer infrastructure to support these large-scale, complex, and diverse NLP models. However, existing proposals cannot provide enough scalability and flexibility as they neither identify nor optimize a wide spectrum of performance-critical operations appearing in recent NLP models and only focus on optimizing specific operations. In this paper, we propose NLP-Fast, a novel system solution to accelerate a wide spectrum of large-scale NLP models. NLP-Fast mainly consists of two parts: (1) NLP-Perf: an in-depth performance analysis tool to identify critical operations in emerging NLP models and (2) NLP-Opt: three end-to-end optimization techniques to accelerate the identified performance-critical operations on various hardware platforms (e.g., CPU, GPU, FPGA). In this way, NLP-Fast can accelerate various types of NLP models on different hardware platforms by identifying their critical operations through NLP-Perf and applying the NLP-Opt's holistic optimizations. We evaluate NLP-Fast on CPU, GPU, and FPGA, and the overall throughputs are increased by up to 2.92\u00d7, 1.59\u00d7, and 4.47\u00d7 over each platform's baseline. We release NLP-Fast to the community so that users are easily able to conduct the NLP-Fast's analysis and apply NLP-Fast's optimizations for their own NLP applications.","doi":"10.1109/PACT52795.2021.00013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT52795.2021.00013","publicationTitle":"2021 30th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and

algorithms on large-scale graphs. Existing system frameworks for these tasks are not only spatially and temporally inefficient, but many also lead to biased results. This paper presents Skywalker, a high-throughput, quality-preserving random walk and sampling framework based on GPUs. Skywalker makes three key contributions: first, it takes the first step to realize efficient biased sampling with the alias method on a GPU. Second, it introduces well-crafted load-balancing techniques to effectively utilize the massive parallelism of GPUs. Third, it accelerates alias table construction and reduce the GPU memory requirement with efficient memory management scheme. We show that Skywalker greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU-based and GPU-based baselines, in a wide spectrum of workload scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563020/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9563020/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","accessionNumber":"21256719","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Skywalker: Efficient Alias-Method-Based Graph Sampling and Random Walk on GPUs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61972247,62072297"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skywalker: Efficient Alias-Method-Based Graph Sampling and Random Walk on GPUs","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"427800a304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109676S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563009","isNumber":"9563010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563009","xplore-issue":"9563010","articleId":"9563020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9563028,"authors":[{"name":"Amirali Boroumand","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon Univ","Stanford Univ"],"firstName":"Amirali","lastName":"Boroumand","id":"37086000685"},{"name":"Saugata Ghose","affiliation":["Univ. of Illinois Urbana-Champaign"],"firstName":"Saugata","lastName":"Ghose","id":"37085354352"},{"name":"Berkin Akin","affiliation":["Google"],"firstName":"Berkin","lastName":"Akin","id":"37085343001"},{"name":"Ravi Narayanaswami","affiliation":["Google"],"firstName":"Ravi","lastName":"Narayanaswami","id":"37088738941"},{"name":"Geraldo F.

These models are designed to fit within the limited area and energy constraints of the edge computing platforms, each targeting various applications (e.g., face detection, speech recognition, translation, image captioning, video analytics). To understand how edge ML accelerators perform, we characterize the performance of a commercial Google Edge TPU, using 24 Google edge NN models (which span a wide range of NN model types) and analyzing each NN layer within each model. We find that the Edge TPU suffers from three major shortcomings: (1) it operates significantly below peak computational throughput, (2) it operates significantly below its theoretical energy efficiency, and (3) its memory system is a large energy and performance bottleneck. Our characterization reveals that the one-size-fits-all, monolithic design of the Edge TPU ignores the high degree of heterogeneity both across different NN models and across different NN layers within the same NN model, leading to the shortcomings we observe. We propose a new acceleration framework called Mensa. Mensa incorporates multiple heterogeneous edge ML accelerators (including both on-chip and near-data accelerators), each of which caters to the characteristics of a particular subset of NN models and layers. During NN inference, for each NN layer, Mensa decides which accelerator to schedule the layer on, taking into account both the optimality of each accelerator for the layer and layer-to-layer communication costs. Our comprehensive analysis of the Google edge NN models shows that all of the layers naturally group into a small number of clusters, which allows us to design an efficient implementation of Mensa for these models with only three specialized accelerators. Averaged across all 24 Google edge NN models, Mensa improves energy efficiency and throughput by 3.0x and 3.1x over the Edge TPU, and by 2.4x and 4.3x over Eyeriss v2, a state-of-the-art accelerator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563028/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9563028/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Google Neural Network Models for Edge Devices: Analyzing and Mitigating Machine Learning Inference Bottlenecks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Google Neural Network Models for Edge Devices: Analyzing and Mitigating Machine Learning Inference Bottlenecks","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"427800a159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.201807S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563009","isNumber":"9563010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563009","xplore-issue":"9563010","articleId":"9563028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9563035,"authors":[{"name":"Guodong Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Sa Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Institute of Computing Technology (Nanjing), Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Sa","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Yungang Bao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Beijing, China","University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Peng Cheng Laboratory, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yungang","lastName":"Bao"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4278-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4279-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9563035","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Analytical models","Machine learning algorithms","Convolution","Computational modeling","Neural networks","Graphics processing units"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["machine learning","neural network","performance model","GPU"]}],"abstract":"With the deepening of research and increasing size of data sets, deep neural networks have become larger and larger. To reduce the training time of large neural networks, researchers propose to optimize neural networks from different levels. When performing optimizations, prior knowledge about execution time of each part of the network can help avoid repeatedly time-consuming testing and profiling process. However it is quite challenging to build an accurate iteration time prediction model, due to opaque underlying implementation of network operators and complex architecture of accelerators. In this paper, we propose SEER, an iteration time prediction model for CNNs, targeting on GPU platforms. We propose to categorize convolution kernels into three different types: Compute-bound, DRAM-bound and Under-utilized, then we build performance model for each type respectively. We combined analytical models and learning-based models to make the performance model accurate and in line with GPU execution model. Experimental results show that, our model achieves 14.71% prediction error on convolution kernels and up to 1.79% prediction error for the overall computation time in one iteration of common CNNs. Besides, when used for selecting the best convolution algorithm, our model shows 7.14% lower error rate than cuDNN's official algorithm picker.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEER: A Time Prediction Model for CNNs from GPU Kernel's View","doi":"10.1109/PACT52795.2021.00020","startPage":"173","endPage":"185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT52795.2021.00020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563010","publicationTitle":"2021 30th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 30th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563009/9563010/09563035.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-29 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"SEER: A Time Prediction Model for CNNs from GPU Kernel's View","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9563035/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"26-29 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62090020"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004739","fundingName":"Youth Innovation Promotion Association of Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"2013073,2020105"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEER: A Time Prediction Model for CNNs from GPU Kernel's View","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"427800a173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134473S","chronDate":"26-29 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563009","isNumber":"9563010","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563009","xplore-issue":"9563010","articleId":"9563035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9563042,"authors":[{"name":"Minxuan Zhou","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Minxuan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086950603"},{"name":"Lingxi Wu","affiliation":["University of Virginia"],"firstName":"Lingxi","lastName":"Wu","id":"37088743875"},{"name":"Muzhou Li","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Muzhou","lastName":"Li","id":"37088914062"},{"name":"Niema Moshiri","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Niema","lastName":"Moshiri","id":"37088486839"},{"name":"Kevin Skadron","affiliation":["University of Virginia"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Skadron","id":"37273724700"},{"name":"Tajana Rosing","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Tajana","lastName":"Rosing","id":"37295875800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4278-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4279-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9563042","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precision medicine","Message passing","Genomics","Bandwidth","Parallel processing","Tools","Vaccines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Processing in memory","Bioinformatics","Accelerator Design"]}],"abstract":"De novo assembly of genomes for which there is no reference, is essential for novel species discovery and metagenomics.

Through the deployment of low-cost passive reflecting elements, the recent studies of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) in wireless networks have shown a great potential for enhancing the quality of the wireless channels and the transmission rates. In this work, motivated by the recent findings, we study the use of an IRS-aided edge computing system for enabling low latency and high reliability computation offloading in the context of a single-user network. Specifically, we optimize the phase shift of the IRS elements along with the device\u2019s transmit power and offloading decision, with the objective of minimizing the device\u2019s energy consumption. Due to the non-convexity of the problem, we propose a customized sub-optimal solution based on the alternating optimization approach, utilizing novel successive convex approximation techniques. Numerical analysis demonstrates the energy reduction and saving in network resources provided by the optimized use of the IRS, especially for offloading services with higher reliability.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3118341","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09563047.pdf","startPage":"3947","endPage":"3951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3118341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563047/","displayDocTitle":"Latency and Reliability Aware Edge Computation Offloading via an Intelligent Reflecting Surface","volume":"25","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9563047/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004489","fundingName":"MITACS & Ciena (OCE & Ciena)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latency and Reliability Aware Edge Computation Offloading via an Intelligent Reflecting Surface","sourcePdf":"lcomm-assi-3118341-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053074S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9563047","onlineDate":"07 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9563092,"authors":[{"name":"Nikos Temenos","affiliation":["National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/9594522/9563092/temen-3114424-small.gif","p":["Nikos Temenos (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in computer and systems engineering from Piraeus University of Applied Sciences, Aigaleo, Greece, in 2015, and the M.Sc. degree in microelectronics from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece, in 2017.

The sample covariance matrix (SCM) is known to perform poorly when the number of variables is large compared to the available number of samples. In order to reduce the mean squared error (MSE) of the SCM, regularized (shrinkage) SCM estimators are often used. In this work, we consider regularized SCM (RSCM) estimators for multiclass problems that couple together two different target matrices for regularization: the pooled (average) SCM of the classes and the scaled identity matrix. Regularization toward the pooled SCM is beneficial when the population covariances are similar, whereas regularization toward the identity matrix guarantees that the estimators are positive definite. We derive the MSE optimal tuning parameters for the estimators as well as propose a method for their estimation under the assumption that the class populations follow (unspecified) elliptical distributions with finite fourth-order moments. The MSE performance of the proposed coupled RSCMs are evaluated with simulations and in a regularized discriminant analysis (RDA) classification set-up on real data. The results based on three different real data sets indicate comparable performance to cross-validation but with a significant speed-up in computation time.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3118546","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09563198.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3118546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","startPage":"5681","endPage":"5692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coupled Regularized Sample Covariance Matrix Estimator for Multiple Classes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coupled Regularized Sample Covariance Matrix Estimator for Multiple Classes","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563198/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 October 2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9563198/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"298118"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Coupled Regularized Sample Covariance Matrix Estimator for Multiple Classes","sourcePdf":"tsp-raninen-3118546-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087996S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9563198","onlineDate":"07 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9563203,"authors":[{"name":"Shixiong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Systems Engineering and Management, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9563203/wang-3118540-small.gif","p":["Shixiong Wang (Graduate Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Eng. degree in detection, guidance, and control technology and the M.Eng. degree in systems and control engineering from the School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, China, in 2016 and 2018, respectively.","He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering and Management, National University of Singapore, Singapore.","His research interests include statistics and optimization theories with applications in signal processing (especially optimal estimation theory), and control technology."]},"firstName":"Shixiong","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-7928-6918"},{"name":"Zhongming Wu","affiliation":["School of Management Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9563203/wu-3118540-small.gif","p":["Zhongming Wu received the Ph.D. degree in management science and engineering from the School of Economics and Management, Southeast University, in 2019.","He is an Associate Professor with the School of Management Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology.","His research interests include optimization theories and applications."]},"firstName":"Zhongming","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0002-9128-5181"},{"name":"Andrew Lim","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Systems Engineering and Management, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore","School of Computing and Artificial Intelligence, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China","Red Jasper Holdings, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9563203/lim-3118540-small.gif","p":["Andrew Lim received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in computer and information sciences from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA, in 1987 and 1992, respectively.","He is currently a Project PI with the School of Computing and Artificial Intelligence, Southwest Jiaotong University, China, and the Chief Scientist with Red Jasper Holdings, Singapore.

These uncertainties can significantly degrade the performance of optimal state estimators designed for nominal system models. The challenge is quantifying such uncertainties and devising robust estimators that are insensitive to them. This paper is therefore concerned with distributionally robust state estimation for linear Markov systems. We propose a new modeling framework that describes uncertainties using a family of distributions so that the worst-case robust estimate in the state space is made over the least-favorable distribution. This framework uses only one or two scalars to express the uncertainty set and does not require the structural information of model uncertainties. Furthermore, the moment-based ambiguity set is suggested to embody the distributional uncertainty family. As a result, the estimation problem transforms into a nonlinear semidefinite program with linear constraints, which can be analytically and efficiently solved. Intensive experiments illustrate the advantages of the proposed framework over existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 October 2021","volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9563203/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2021","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust State Estimation for Linear Systems Under Distributional Uncertainty","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001381","fundingName":"National Research Foundation Singapore","grantNumber":"NRF-RSS2016-004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"72071139"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"12001286"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013156","fundingName":"Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2020r003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust State Estimation for Linear Systems Under Distributional Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"tsp-wu-3118540-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174046S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9563203","onlineDate":"07 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":9563205,"authors":[{"name":"Deepak Jose","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Calicut, Calicut, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/9655601/9563205/jose-3118457-small.gif","p":["Deepak Jose (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Cochin University of Science and Technology, Cochin, India, in 2009 and the M.Tech. degree in communication and radar engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India, in 2012.

Spatial modulation (SM) is a scheme used in multi-antenna transmission scenarios where the data is transmitted in the amplitude, phase and spatial domains through selected antennas. In the coherent domain, generalized SM (GSM) employs multiple antennas in combination during every time slot to enhance the spectral efficiency (SE). In this paper, we propose two differential schemes which activate two or more antennas at a time to transmit the modulated symbol. These schemes achieve higher SE using a lesser number of antennas and lower order modulation schemes instead of the higher number of antennas required for conventional SM schemes based on differential modulation. Simulation studies reveal that the proposed schemes have better bit error rate performance than traditional differential SM schemes. We also derive the analytical union bound for the proposed schemes and is satisfied from medium to high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2021.3118457","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"12640","endPage":"12650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2021.3118457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9655601","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/9655601/09563205.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Modulation","Complexity theory","Radio frequency","Receiving antennas","GSM","Antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spatial modulation (SM)","generalized spatial modulation (GSM)","differential spatial modulation (DSM)","multiple input multiple output (MIMO)","average bit error probability (ABEP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Differential Transmission Schemes for Generalized Spatial Modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563205/","volume":"70","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9563205/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2021","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010218","fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"SR/FST/ET-I/2017/68"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Transmission Schemes for Generalized Spatial Modulation","sourcePdf":"tvt-jose-3118457-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105124S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"9655601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","xplore-issue":"9655601","articleId":"9563205","onlineDate":"07 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9563206,"authors":[{"name":"Hoon Sung Chwa","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, DGIST, Daegu, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9603995/9563206/chwa-3118610-small.gif","p":["Hoon Sung Chwa (Member, IEEE) received the BS, MS, and PhD degrees from KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea, in 2009, 2011, and 2016, respectively, all in computer science.

In the real-time systems community, the concept of an MC system is regarded as a promising, emerging solution to solve an inherent challenge of real-time systems: pessimistic reservation of computing resources, which yields a low resource-utilization for the sake of guaranteeing timing requirements. Since a timing guarantee should be provided before a real-time system starts to operate, its feasibility has been extensively studied for single-criticality systems; however, the same cannot be said for MC systems. In this article, we develop necessary feasibility tests for MC real-time embedded systems, which is the first study that yields non-trivial results for MC necessary feasibility on both uniprocessor and multiprocessor platforms. To this end, we investigate characteristics of MC necessary feasibility conditions, and identify new challenges posed by the characteristics. By addressing those challenges, we develop two collective necessary feasibility tests and their simplified versions, which are able to exploit a tradeoff between capability in finding infeasible task sets and time-complexity. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed tests find a number of additional infeasible task sets for both uniprocessor and multiprocessor platforms, which have been proven neither feasible nor infeasible by any existing studies.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3118610","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9603995/09563206.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3118610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9603995","startPage":"1520","endPage":"1537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Necessary Feasibility Analysis for Mixed-Criticality Real-Time Embedded Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Necessary Feasibility Analysis for Mixed-Criticality Real-Time Embedded Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563206/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 October 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"7","publicationDate":"1 July 2022","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9563206/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"2020R1F1A1076058, 2021R1A2B5B02001758, 2019R1F1A1059663 and 2017M3A9G8084463"},{"fundingName":"Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation","grantNumber":"2014-3-00065"},{"fundingName":"DGIST R&D Program of MSIT","grantNumber":"20-CoE-IT-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Necessary Feasibility Analysis for Mixed-Criticality Real-Time Embedded Systems","sourcePdf":"tpds-lee-3118610-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.285142S","chronDate":"July 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9603995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9603995","articleId":"9563206","onlineDate":"07 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9563213,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Wang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT University), Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Ke Wang (Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Melbourne, Australia, in 2014.

To cope with the multi-user access requirement, the use of SM in conjunction with the orthogonal multiple access (OMA), transmitting antenna grouping (TAG) and non-orthogonal multi-access (NOMA) approaches has been proposed and investigated. However, these approaches have fundamental limitations, namely, OMA reduces the effective spectral efficiency and data rate per user, TAG introduces significant multi-user interference (MUI), and NOMA requires relatively complicated successive interference cancellation (SIC) to limit the MUI. To overcome these limitations, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a filter-enhanced TAG multi-user access scheme in SM-based indoor optical wireless communication systems. By using spatial waveform shaping filters in the transmitters, multiple users can be served simultaneously, thus maintaining high data rate per user, while eliminating MUI, which typically degrades the bit-error-rate (BER) performance. In the conducted experiments, over gigabit-per-second (Gbps) optical wireless communication with SM is provided to two users simultaneously, and results show that the impact of MUI on the BER performance is negligible. Results also show that the proposed multi-user access approach is capable of supporting users with different modulation formats simultaneously. The adaptive user data rate allocation via the spatial domain according to requirements is also demonstrated. The performance of proposed filter-enhanced TAG scheme is compared with the conventional TAG method. Results show that the BER performance can be improved by more than two orders of magnitude. The proposed filter-enhanced scheme is a promising solution that provides high-speed SM optical wireless communications to multiple users.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Transmitters","Modulation","Optical filters","NOMA","MIMO communication","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor optical wireless communications","optical spatial modulation","multi-user access","multi-user interference"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JLT.2021.3118669","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/9664591/09563213.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9664591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2021.3118669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filter-Enhanced Multi-User Scheme for Spatial Modulation Based Optical Wireless Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Filter-Enhanced Multi-User Scheme for Spatial Modulation Based Optical Wireless Communication Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563213/","volume":"40","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9563213/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP170100268"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filter-Enhanced Multi-User Scheme for Spatial Modulation Based Optical Wireless Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-wang-3118669-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068186S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2022","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"9664591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","xplore-issue":"9664591","articleId":"9563213","onlineDate":"07 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":9563221,"authors":[{"name":"Javad Mirzaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9563221/mirza-3118492-small.gif","p":["Javad Mirzaei (Student Member, IEEE) was born in Tehran, Iran.

Importantly, other than the knowledge of channel correlation matrices, we make no assumption as to the structure of the channel. To address the limitation in the number of RF chains, we employ hybrid beamforming, comprising a low dimensional digital beamformer followed by an analog beamformer implemented using phase shifters. Since there is no dedicated RF chain per transmitter/receiver antenna, the conventional channel estimation techniques for fully-digital systems are impractical. Exploiting the fact that the channel entries are uncorrelated in its eigen-domain, we seek to estimate the channel entries in this domain. Due to the limited number of RF chains, channel estimation is typically performed in multiple time slots. Under a total energy budget, we aim to design the hybrid precoder and the receive combiner in each training time slot, in order to estimate the channel using the minimum mean squared error criterion. To this end, we choose the precoder and combiner in each time slot such that they are aligned to transmitter and receiver eigen-directions, respectively. Further, we derive a water-filling type expression for the optimal energy allocation at each time slot. This expression illustrates that, with a low training energy budget, only significant components of the channel need to be estimated. Simulation results indicate that the proposed channel estimation scheme can efficiently estimate correlated massive MIMO channels within a few training time slots.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3118492","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09563221.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3118492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","startPage":"5784","endPage":"5800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Analog and Digital Beamforming Design for Channel Estimation in Correlated Massive MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Analog and Digital Beamforming Design for Channel Estimation in Correlated Massive MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563221/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 October 2021","isJournal":true,"volume":"69","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9563221/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing"},{"fundingName":"TELUS Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingName":"Canadian ENCQOR program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Analog and Digital Beamforming Design for Channel Estimation in Correlated Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-shahbazpanahi-3118492-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157155S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9563221","onlineDate":"07 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9563227,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Geng","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/9307529/9563227/geng-3118538-small.gif","p":["Hang Geng (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in electronic information engineering from Civil Aviation Flight University of China, Guanghan, China, in 2011, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2014 and 2017, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.

The parametric uncertainty is characterized by the multiplicative noise appearing in both state and observation equations, and the measurement censoring is governed by the Tobit observation model. The fusion estimation is implemented via two stages: at the first stage, each sensor sends its observations to the local estimator and, at the second stage, the local estimates are then transmitted to the fusion center so as to generate the fused estimate. The local estimator realizes a Tobit Kalman filtering algorithm which is devised in accordance with a modified regression model, whilst the fusion center carries out the fusion estimation by resorting to the federated fusion rule. Furthermore, the monotonicity of the fused error covariance with respect to the censoring threshold is discussed and, subsequently, the boundedness property is also examined where both lower and upper bounds are acquired for the fused error covariance. The validity of the fusion estimator is finally shown via two numerical examples.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3118538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","startPage":"5875","endPage":"5890","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09563227.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Sensor Filtering Fusion With Parametric Uncertainties and Measurement Censoring: Monotonicity and Boundedness","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9563227/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-Sensor Filtering Fusion With Parametric Uncertainties and Measurement Censoring: Monotonicity and Boundedness","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"69","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100011665","fundingName":"Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004054","fundingName":"King Abdulaziz University","grantNumber":"FP-091-43"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62173068, 61803074, 61703245, 61973102, U2030205, 61903065, 61671109, U1830207 and U1830133"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2018M643441 and 2017M623005"},{"fundingName":"Royal Society of the U.K."},{"fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Sensor Filtering Fusion With Parametric Uncertainties and Measurement Censoring: Monotonicity and Boundedness","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-3118538-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119528S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9563227","onlineDate":"07 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":9563229,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaorui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9603995/9563229/zhang-3118609-small.gif","p":["Zhaorui Zhang received the BSc degree in computer science from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University.

For large-scale deployment, communication becomes the bottleneck, and the parameter updating strategy strongly impacts the training performance and accuracy. Recent state-of-art solutions have adopted the local SGD approach, which enables workers to update their local version of models and only aggregate them to update the global parameters after finishing a number of iterations, to alleviate heavy communication pressure on the parameter server and improving the training performance. We identify three limitations of these works. First, these works do not provide an approach for determining when the worker is to update the parameter with the server under asynchronous communication strategies that can guarantee the training performance. Second, local SGD suffers from the problem of unbounded gradient delay. Previous work works well for a short delay while can not guarantee the performance with an increase of gradient delay. Third, they do not consider the system performance when determining the update interval of the local SGD, including the CPU, memory, and network, which affects the training performance extremely. We provide a self-adaptive parameter updating strategy called SaPus, which allows each worker to detect their training results through quantification of the accumulated gradient updates and determine when to update the parameter with the server adaptively and individually. Theoretical lower and upper bound of the update interval is also provided. We also propose a weighted aggregation algorithm based on a global-loss window, which is used to collect the most recent loss value of other workers to calculate a \n<i>weight</i>\n for the accumulated gradients of each worker to solve the unbounded delay problem in asynchronous local SGD. To increase the robustness of our parameter updating strategy, a performance model is built to provide a resource-aware lower bound for the update interval.

Especially, when modern storage devices with high bandwidth and low latency are used, the read performance of KV store is seriously affected by inefficient file indexing. Besides, due to the deletion pattern of inserting tombstones, the KV stores based on LSM-tree are faced with the problem of read performance fluctuations that are caused by large-scale data deletion (also referred to as the Read-After-Delete problem). In this article, TridentKV is proposed to improve the read performance of KV stores. An adaptive learned index structure is first designed to speed up file indexing. Also, a space-efficient partition strategy is proposed to solve the Read-After-Delete problem. Besides, asynchronous reading design is adopted, and SPDK is supported for high concurrency and low latency. TridentKV is implemented on RocksDB and the evaluation results indicate that compared with RocksDB, the read performance of TridentKV is improved by 7\u00d7 to 12\u00d7 without loss of write performance and TridentKV provides stable read performance even if a large number of deletions or migrations occur.

We derive a necessary rank condition that identifiable gross error matrix should satisfy. Then, we present an identifiability-aware version of the proposed algorithm wherein we exploit the aforementioned identifiability condition to improve the accuracy of gross error localization.

Recent advances in deep learning have introduced new possibilities for a robust and fast PR. An emerging technique called deep unfolding provides a systematic connection between conventional model-based iterative algorithms and modern data-based deep learning. Unfolded algorithms, which are powered by data learning, have shown remarkable performance and convergence speed improvement over original algorithms. Despite their potential, most existing unfolded algorithms are strictly confined to a fixed number of iterations when layer-dependent parameters are used. In this study, we develop a novel framework for deep unfolding to overcome existing limitations. Our development is based on an unfolded generalized expectation consistent signal recovery (GEC-SR) algorithm, wherein damping factors are left for data-driven learning. In particular, we introduce a hypernetwork to generate the damping factors for GEC-SR. Instead of learning a set of optimal damping factors directly, the hypernetwork learns how to generate the optimal damping factors according to the clinical settings, thereby ensuring its adaptivity to different scenarios. To enable the hypernetwork to adapt to varying layer numbers, we use a recurrent architecture to develop a dynamic hypernetwork that generates a damping factor that can vary online across layers. We also exploit a self-attention mechanism to enhance the robustness of the hypernetwork. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing ones in terms of convergence speed and accuracy and still works well under very harsh settings, even under which many classical PR algorithms are unstable.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase Retrieval Using Expectation Consistent Signal Recovery Algorithm Based on Hypernetwork","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2021.3118494","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/9307529/09563250.pdf","startPage":"5770","endPage":"5783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2021.3118494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9307529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"07 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Phase Retrieval Using Expectation Consistent Signal Recovery Algorithm Based on Hypernetwork","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"69","htmlLink":"/document/9563250/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 108-2628-E-110-001-MY3 and MOST 110-2224-E-110-001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 110-2221-E-A49-026"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61625106 and 61941104"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase Retrieval Using Expectation Consistent Signal Recovery Algorithm Based on Hypernetwork","sourcePdf":"tsp-wen-3118494-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118227S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"9307529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","xplore-issue":"9307529","articleId":"9563250","onlineDate":"07 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":9563274,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Kleppmann","affiliation":["University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/9603995/9563274/klepp-3118603-small.gif","p":["Martin Kleppmann is currently a senior research associate with the University of Cambridge.

In this paper, a novel Hybrid DNA Computing based encoding techniques is proposed and it provides greater level of security to the bank server data by encode the data stored in the server. The proposed encoding techniques encrypt the account holders detail by using Elliptic Curve Cryptography and encode the encrypted data into DNA code. The encoded data bits are embedded into the account holder's image by incorporating the DNA mapping table. The encoded image divide into four quadrants, then 2 quadrants of data are Exclusive- OR with other 2 Quadrant of data and stored it in the bank server. This proposed encoding techniques provide the bigger security to the data stored in the server with less number of processing time, operation bits, in turn help to reduce the storage capacity of server. Finally, proposed hybrid DNA computing techniques are simulated using MATLAB simulation tool and analyze its performance with the simulation parameter such as key size, processing time, data bits and image size.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9563309/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Bank Data safeguard technique using ECC based DNA Computing Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Bank Data safeguard technique using ECC based DNA Computing Algorithm","confLoc":"Ernakulam, India","sourcePdf":"32_Paper_180.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045913S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563275","isNumber":"9563276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563275","xplore-issue":"9563276","articleId":"9563309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9563316,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Nowadays, activity recognition is more possible and accurate due to good development in artificial neural networks like convolutional neural network CNN. In many recent works, the recognition model architecture use CNN and long short-term memory units (LSTM) - attention models to extract spatial and temporal features from the input video. This particular work is related to real-time human activity recognition by Resnet and 3D CNN without the involvement of the LSTM- attention model. Here the 2D Resnet is modified to 3D CNN to achieve better human activity recognition accuracy. The wide range of data information from the kinetics dataset can avoid overfitting issues during the training period. And the combination of Resnet and 3D CNN can enhance the accuracy of recognition. As a consequence, a method for detecting, monitoring, and recognizing real-time human motion has been developed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563316/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9563316/","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Real-time Human Activity Recognition Using ResNet and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time Human Activity Recognition Using ResNet and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Ernakulam, India","sourcePdf":"35_Paper_105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055857S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563275","isNumber":"9563276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563275","xplore-issue":"9563276","articleId":"9563316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":9563320,"authors":[{"name":"M Sreerag","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Communication Engineering, School of Engineering, CUSAT, Cochin, Kerala"],"firstName":"M","lastName":"Sreerag","id":"37089000629"},{"name":"Anju Pradeep","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Communication Engineering, School of Engineering, CUSAT, Cochin, Kerala"],"firstName":"Anju","lastName":"Pradeep","id":"38192202300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7136-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7137-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9563320","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fabrication","Mutual coupling","Simulation","Impedance matching","Dual band","Resonant frequency","Permittivity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","WLAN","Mutual coupling"]}],"abstract":"In this paper dual band multiple input multiple output antenna (MIMO) is presented.

This paper presents an overview of such methods. Nowadays machine learning chips are available with a high level of parallel designs, but deep neural network requires flexible and efficient hardware structure that can be perfect for any type of neural networks. Also, varieties of hardware topologies are available for FPGA implementation. This paper explains those architectural variations and suggests a new topology. The proposed architecture adopts the systolic structure and applies to any feed forward neural networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Auto Encoder (AE) and, Logic Regression (LR). Unlike other hardware neural network structures, this architecture implements a single activation function block and the largest layer only. This paper also includes the implementation of a feed-forward neural network for digit recognition (0 to 9) in the Zynq-7000 board with MNIST as the dataset. Different activation functions and different parameters of each activation function are used for the network. Changes and improvements are mentioned in this paper based on Accuracy, Operating frequency and, Resource usage. Logistic Sigmoidal functions can achieve more accuracy and performance as compared with others.","publicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication, Embedded and Secure Systems (ACCESS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication, Embedded and Secure Systems (ACCESS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563275/9563276/09563342.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Hardware Architecture for FPGA Implementation of Feed Forward Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS51619.2021.9563342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS51619.2021.9563342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A New Hardware Architecture for FPGA Implementation of Feed Forward Neural Networks","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9563342/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Hardware Architecture for FPGA Implementation of Feed Forward Neural Networks","confLoc":"Ernakulam, India","sourcePdf":"22_Paper_220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080699S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563275","isNumber":"9563276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563275","xplore-issue":"9563276","articleId":"9563342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9563346,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Learning sign languages at an early age is very essential for the social and intellectual developments of the deaf community. However, the lack of qualified trainers is a challenging problem that restricts the opportunity for getting formal sign language education for the deaf individuals. Hence, the need for developing an online system for learning sign language gestures through self assessment is very essential. The primary requirement for developing such a system is an efficient sign language recognition (SLR) model. This paper presents an efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) based model for automatically recognizing fingerspellings in sign languages. The model has been tested on a novel Indian sign language (ISL) fingerspelling dataset as well as a publicly available hand posture dataset, and has obtained promising results.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS51619.2021.9563346","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563275/9563276/09563346.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"160","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication, Embedded and Secure Systems (ACCESS)","publicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication, Embedded and Secure Systems (ACCESS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS51619.2021.9563346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional Neural Network based Sign Language Recognition to Assist Online Assessment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional Neural Network based Sign Language Recognition to Assist Online Assessment","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","publicationDate":"2 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9563346/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional Neural Network based Sign Language Recognition to Assist Online Assessment","confLoc":"Ernakulam, India","sourcePdf":"31_Paper_171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.146651S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563275","isNumber":"9563276","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563275","xplore-issue":"9563276","articleId":"9563346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":9563370,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Physiotherapy and post-surgery rehabilitation are essential stages of the treatment to gain control over the knees and strengthen muscles around the knees. These are conducted under the guidance of therapists and physicians. Robotic therapeutic tools such as CPM machines cut down the massive expenditure of frequent consultations with physicians. However, the available devices in the market are passive as they do not dynamically adapt to a patient's needs as it follows pre-set functions. In this paper, a novel approach is presented to control and actuate a CPM machine by integrating a deep learning based control strategy using CNNs. EMG and IMU sensors are interfaced with the patient's thigh muscles to classify the patient's intent as three states: forward, backward and rest. For implementing the algorithms, a low cost, ecofriendly alpha prototyped CPM machine is developed. Dataset is collected by performing experiments on three healthy subjects under different conditions. Experimental performance shows the feasibility of this home rehabilitation device and accurate intuitive motion predictions with CNN.","doi":"10.1109/MASCON51689.2021.9563370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCON51689.2021.9563370","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Madras Section Conference (MASCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563254/9563258/09563370.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Madras Section Conference (MASCON)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning Based Muscle Intent Classification in Continuous Passive Motion Machine for Knee Osteoarthritis Rehabilitation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning Based Muscle Intent Classification in Continuous Passive Motion Machine for Knee Osteoarthritis Rehabilitation","conferenceDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9563370/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563370/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning Based Muscle Intent Classification in Continuous Passive Motion Machine for Knee Osteoarthritis Rehabilitation","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"MASCON480.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.160439S","chronDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563254","isNumber":"9563258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563254","xplore-issue":"9563258","articleId":"9563370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9563376,"authors":[{"name":"Haile Yang","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Haile","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088998114"},{"name":"Lin Lin","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Lin","id":"37559265400"},{"name":"Shisheng Zhong","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Shisheng","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37067121300"},{"name":"Feng Guo","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics Engineering Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Guo","id":"37088516347"},{"name":"Zhiquan Cui","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Weihai, China"],"firstName":"Zhiquan","lastName":"Cui","id":"37085964077"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4976-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4977-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9563376","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563376","abstract":"At present, the aero engines fault diagnosis method based on convolutional neural network can only deal with the features of local region and it was difficult to effectively capture the long-range dependencies which leads to the problem of low accuracy. Attention mechanism can solve this problem to some extent now. However, the typical attention blocks don't have sufficient interaction for input features in a certain dimension. To solve it, we propose multiple attentional mechanism, which is implemented in the form of multiple attention block. In this block, we introduce channel attention mechanism for the problem that non-local attention block includes all features into the calculation of attention matrix but channel feature interaction is still insufficient, so that it can make full use of spatial features, consider the interaction of channel features and finally further improve the interaction of global features. The input and output dimensions of this method are consistent, so it can be freely embedded into the structure of the convolutional neural network. The experimental results based on CFM56-7B engines of an airline showed that the proposed mechanism could effectively improve the recognition accuracy of the model, and was higher than other neural network structures, which proved that the multiple attention mechanism has strong generalization, robustness and competitiveness.","doi":"10.1109/SDPC52933.2021.9563376","startPage":"13","endPage":"18","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Control (SDPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563255/9563263/09563376.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Control (SDPC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDPC52933.2021.9563376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563263","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aero Engines Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Convolutional Neural Network Using Multiple Attention Mechanism","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Conferences","Atmospheric modeling","Neural networks","Robustness","Sensors","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convolutional neural network","multiple attention mechanism","long-range dependency","aero engines fault diagnosis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Aero Engines Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Convolutional Neural Network Using Multiple Attention Mechanism","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9563376/","publicationDate":"13 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"national key research and development project","grantNumber":"2018YFB1700902"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aero Engines Fault Diagnosis Method Based on Convolutional Neural Network Using Multiple Attention Mechanism","confLoc":"Weihai, China","sourcePdf":"8_Final_manuscript.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075822S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563255","isNumber":"9563263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563255","xplore-issue":"9563263","articleId":"9563376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":9563381,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Xu","affiliation":["College of physics and Optoelectronic Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Xu","id":"37088996270"},{"name":"Xiaoyu Li","affiliation":["College of physics and Optoelectronic Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Li","id":"37086451650"},{"name":"Yong Tian","affiliation":["College of physics and Optoelectronic Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Tian","id":"37085384612"},{"name":"Jindong Tian","affiliation":["College of physics and Optoelectronic Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jindong","lastName":"Tian","id":"37086038299"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4976-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4977-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9563381","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563381","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","Employee welfare","Training","Temperature sensors","Temperature distribution","Estimation","Voltage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["under-sampled data","state of charge","empirical mode decomposition","a compensation strategy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SDPC52933.2021.9563381","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563255/9563263/09563381.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Control (SDPC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Control (SDPC)","startPage":"157","endPage":"162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDPC52933.2021.9563381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State of Charge Estimation for Under-Sampled Battery Data Based on LSTM with Empirical Mode Decomposition and a Compensation Strategy","abstract":"When the battery data is under-sampled, the state of charge (SOC), a significant parameter of a battery management system (BMS) in electric vehicles (EVs) is more difficult to be estimated with high accuracy. Long-short term memory (LSTM) network combined with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and a compensation strategy is proposed to solve this issue. EMD is used to decompose the battery sequence data into low and high frequency sub-sequences first. Further, voltage residue, one of the low frequency subsequences extracted by EMD is compensated through average voltage on the internal resistance so as to improve the polymerization degree of different working conditions. Then, multiple sub-sequences of the battery sequence data are fed into a constructed LSTM for training and predicting. Finally, two driving cycles at \u221210\u00b0C, 0 \u00b0C, 10\u00b0C and 25 \u00b0C ambient temperatures are applied to verifying the proposed method. The maximums of root-mean square errors of SOC estimation at four ambient temperatures are 2.1%, 2.0%, 1.8% and 1.1%, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563381/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9563381/","publicationDate":"13 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"State of Charge Estimation for Under-Sampled Battery Data Based on LSTM with Empirical Mode Decomposition and a Compensation Strategy","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2021A1515010525"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51807121"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State of Charge Estimation for Under-Sampled Battery Data Based on LSTM with Empirical Mode Decomposition and a Compensation Strategy","confLoc":"Weihai, China","sourcePdf":"75_Final_manuscript.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070745S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563255","isNumber":"9563263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563255","xplore-issue":"9563263","articleId":"9563381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":9563393,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Feng Liu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Dongdong Zhao","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dongdong","lastName":"Zhao"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4976-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4977-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9563393","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Vibrations","Training","Adaptation models","Digital twin","Generative adversarial networks","Numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault diagnosis","digital twin","domain adaptation","generative adversarial nets"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563393","abstract":"Abundant fault samples are crucial for intelligent fault diagnosis models. However, collecting efficient annotated faulty data are often expensive or infeasible, especially for safety-critical systems. Instead of directly training diagnosis models on hard-to-collected sensory signals, training on simulated data generated from digital twin is feasible since simulated data with annotation is easy to access. However, simulated samples are often not realistic enough and domain gap exists between simulated and real sensory samples. The fault diagnosis model may lack of generalization if the model is trained only on simulated samples. In this paper, we propose a deep transfer fault diagnosis approach which generalizes fault diagnosis knowledge from digital twin to perform fault diagnosis task in real-world. First, a digital twin model with capability of bearing dynamics is composed using numerical simulation method, from which the simulated faulty samples are generated under various faulty depth and operation conditions. Second, a generative adversarial network is utilized to perform domain adaptation and eliminate the domain gap. Specifically, the generator component conditioned on simulated samples as well as random noise and produces target-like samples as realistic as possible to fool the discriminator. The discriminator component is trained to distinguish the samples as real or synthetic. Hence, the classifier component trained on generated samples can generalize well in real fault diagnosis tasks. Extensive experiments on CWRU dataset are performed to validate the effective of proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/SDPC52933.2021.9563393","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Control (SDPC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Control (SDPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563255/9563263/09563393.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDPC52933.2021.9563393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Transfer Fault Diagnosis Using Digital Twin and Generative Adversarial Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Transfer Fault Diagnosis Using Digital Twin and Generative Adversarial Network","htmlLink":"/document/9563393/","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","publicationDate":"13 Aug. 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Transfer Fault Diagnosis Using Digital Twin and Generative Adversarial Network","confLoc":"Weihai, China","sourcePdf":"95_Final_manuscript.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.145079S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563255","isNumber":"9563263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563255","xplore-issue":"9563263","articleId":"9563393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9563396,"authors":[{"name":"Ponukupati Ravi Teja","affiliation":["Amrita School of Engineering Coimbatore, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, India"],"firstName":"Ponukupati Ravi","lastName":"Teja","id":"37088998981"},{"name":"R.

This paper proposed an intelligent underwater acoustic signal processing and recognition method based on artificial neural network (ANN) and signal feature extraction. Firstly, the real part and imaginary part of the signal are extracted by fast Fourier transform (FFT), the variance, mean and other eigenvalues of the real part and imaginary part are calculated, respectively. Secondly, the extracted signal features are used to train ANN classifier to realize the classification and recognition of different signals. In this way, the intelligent recognition of underwater acoustic signal by data-driven method is realized. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation, and the good recognition effect is achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563404/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9563404/","publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Signals Recognition of Underwater Acoustic Communication based on Artificial Neural Network and Signal Feature Extraction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signals Recognition of Underwater Acoustic Communication based on Artificial Neural Network and Signal Feature Extraction","confLoc":"Changchun, China","sourcePdf":"EC101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106349S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563252","isNumber":"9563256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563252","xplore-issue":"9563256","articleId":"9563404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":9563425,"authors":[{"name":"Nilu R.

One of the biggest challenges in the area of inter-turn fault is to detect the fault having less than 10% of total turns in a phase. In this paper, an attempt is made to analyse stator inter-turn fault in Surface Mounted Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (SPMSM) using Finite Element Method (FEM). A 0.55 kW SPMSM model is obtained from ANSYS Maxwell finite element tool and it is linked to ANSYS Simplorer by transient - transient link to supply power and apply load to the motor. Three phase voltage source inverter with Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) control technique is created in MATLAB Simulink and coupled with Simplorer to control the machine. Analysis is carried out for different inter-turn fault severities such as 15T (7.2%), 30T (14.4%) and 45T (21.6%) respectively. Various machine parameters such as phase current, torque, speed, flux distribution over the machine and radial air gap flux density are analysed and compared with faulty machines. It has been observed that flux density distribution is less in the stator teeth and core region of faulty coil and the rms value of winding current and radial air gap flux density increases proportionally with severity of ITSC fault. Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) is applied to analyse the stator current of SPMSM for various inter-turn severities. It is observed that peak magnitude of the EWT decomposed components increases when there is increase in severity of fault.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Madras Section Conference (MASCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563254/9563258/09563446.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Madras Section Conference (MASCON)","doi":"10.1109/MASCON51689.2021.9563446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCON51689.2021.9563446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563258","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of EWT for Analysing Stator Inter-Turn Fault in SPMSM using Finite Element Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Space vector pulse width modulation","Stator cores","Air gaps","Stator windings","Permanent magnet motors","Mathematical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["surface mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor","inter-turn short circuit fault","finite element method","empirical wavelet transform","pulse width modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Application of EWT for Analysing Stator Inter-Turn Fault in SPMSM using Finite Element Method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9563446/","publicationDate":"27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","conferenceDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of EWT for Analysing Stator Inter-Turn Fault in SPMSM using Finite Element Method","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"MASCON356.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058751S","chronDate":"27-28 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563254","isNumber":"9563258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563254","xplore-issue":"9563258","articleId":"9563446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9563461,"authors":[{"name":"Yiben Liu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electronic Information, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, P.R.

The feature learning performance of traditional prognosis models is influenced by the noise characteristics of the original vibration signal with ease. In view of the limitation, a RUL prediction approach on the strength of the multi-scale convolutional neural network with Squeeze-and-Excitation mechanism (MsCNN_SE) is proposed. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is used to extract time-frequency characteristics from original signals, which are considered as the input of MsCNN_SE model for RUL prediction. The designed multi-scale network can extract richer local information and alleviate the phenomenon of gradient disappearance by increasing the network width. To reduce the interference of redundant features, the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) mechanism is introduced to enhance the correlation between features. Compared with the traditional convolutional neural network, the MsCNN_SE model can maintain global and local information at the same time. The validity of the proposed approach is verified by experimental data, and it shows a good prediction performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Deep Feature Learning Method based on Time-frequency Images and MsCNN_SE for RUL Prediction","doi":"10.1109/SDPC52933.2021.9563461","startPage":"163","endPage":"167","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDPC52933.2021.9563461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563263","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Control (SDPC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Diagnostics, Prognostics, and Control (SDPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563255/9563263/09563461.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563461","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563461/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Deep Feature Learning Method based on Time-frequency Images and MsCNN_SE for RUL Prediction","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9563461/","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","publicationDate":"13 Aug. 2021","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1711203"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002366","fundingName":"China University of Geosciences","grantNumber":"1910491B05"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Deep Feature Learning Method based on Time-frequency Images and MsCNN_SE for RUL Prediction","confLoc":"Weihai, China","sourcePdf":"77_Final_manuscript.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066246S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563255","isNumber":"9563263","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563255","xplore-issue":"9563263","articleId":"9563461","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9563472,"authors":[{"name":"Aashish Kumar","affiliation":["School of Information & Comm.

Accurate prediction of the remaining service life of the bearing can improve the reliability of the equipment, and also provide practical reference for equipment maintenance. Therefore, a multi-scale convolution neural network prediction model is proposed to accurately estimate the bearing degradation state. Firstly, the continuous wavelet transform and quadratic degradation function are combined to establish an effective bearing health index. Secondly, the multi-scale convolution model is used to extract the deep features of the data.

However, the large image size and complex algorithm bring challenges to implement ship detection effectively and efficiently. This article studies a novel ship detection method, which utilizes PP-YOLO to achieve this objective. Two kinds of remote sensing images are utilized in the evaluation experiments, including visible light and synthetic aperture radar. Compared with YOLO-v3 and YOLO-v4, the proposed method has advantages of average accuracy and detection speed. To be specific, the average accuracy is increased by 10.8% and 32.7%, respectively.

DR broadly is classified into two stages - non-proliferative (NPDR), where there are almost no symptoms, except a few microaneurysms, and proliferative (PDR) involving a huge number of micro aneurysms and hemorrhages, soft and hard exudates, neo-vascularization, macular ischemia or a combination of these, making it easier to detect. More specifically, DR is usually classified into five levels, labeled 0\u20134, from 0 indicating no DR to 4 which is most severe. This paper firstly presents a discussion on the risk factors of the disease, then surveys the recent literature on the topic followed by examining certain techniques which were found to be highly effective in improving the prognosis accuracy. Finally, a convolutional neural network model is proposed to detect all the stages of DR on a low-memory edge micro controller.

By analyzing the data, extracting the characteristics of security-related elements in the network, using the BP neural network to continuously adjust the weights and thresholds, the actual output value of the network is compared with the expected value. The error means the square error is the smallest, and the nonlinear mapping relationship of the network situation value is found.

Traditional underwater cables cannot adapt to the communication between mobile nodes, and underwater acoustic communication cannot meet the increasing demand for data transmission. Underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) has great advantages in short-distance high-speed underwater communication application scenarios because of its advantages such as high speed, low latency, low power consumption, and good confidentiality. However, due to the large attenuation, the limited transmission distance of light in the water has been restricting the development and application of UWOC. This review summarizes the methods and technical paths for extending the distance of UWOC, which can provide some inspiration for those engaged in this research field.","doi":"10.1109/ICOCN53177.2021.9563681","publicationTitle":"2021 19th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 19th

on grouped subcarrier index modulated OFDM is proposed. This method makes the number of silent subcarriers as an extra modulation dimension, so as to increase the number of bits carried on SIM-OFDM symbol and improve the spectrum efficiency of the system. According to the simulation result, although the BER of multidimensional modulated GSIM-OFDM system is a little higher than that of traditional GSIM-OFDM system, the spectrum efficiency of the system with the proposed method is also better than that of the system with traditional grouped modulation method. What's more, the more groups, the more obvious the advantage of spectrum efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ICOCN53177.2021.9563709","publicationTitle":"2021 19th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 19th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563253/9563628/09563709.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOCN53177.2021.9563709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional Modulation Method based on Grouped Subcarrier Index Modulated OFDM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563709/","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional Modulation Method based on Grouped Subcarrier Index Modulated OFDM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9563709/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1801302"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61835002,61727817,62021005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2020M680384,2020M680385"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional Modulation Method based on Grouped Subcarrier Index Modulated OFDM","confLoc":"Qufu, China","sourcePdf":"180_manuscript.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067439S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563253","isNumber":"9563628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563253","xplore-issue":"9563628","articleId":"9563709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9563725,"authors":[{"name":"Mao Ge","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, P.R.

Collaborative cloud-edge computing networks (CCECNs) is an effective way to alleviate the limitation of computing capacity by offloading complex tasks from IoT. Thus, this paper mainly proposes selective offloading network resource optimization approaches to address the offloading network resource problems for user requests in CCECNs. Simulation results show that proposed approaches can optimize network resource allocation and can reduce end-to-end (E2E) latency and blocking probability.","doi":"10.1109/ICOCN53177.2021.9563764","publicationTitle":"2021 19th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 19th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563253/9563628/09563764.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOCN53177.2021.9563764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563628","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective Offloading Network Resource Optimization Approaches in Collaborative Cloud-Edge Computing Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Selective Offloading Network Resource Optimization Approaches in Collaborative Cloud-Edge Computing Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563764/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9563764/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61701332,62075147"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2020T130460,2020M671598"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective Offloading Network Resource Optimization Approaches in Collaborative Cloud-Edge Computing Networks","confLoc":"Qufu, China","sourcePdf":"098_manuscript.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042315S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563253","isNumber":"9563628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563253","xplore-issue":"9563628","articleId":"9563764","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9563841,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Lian","affiliation":["School of Water Conservancy and Hydroelectric Power, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Lian","id":"37089000807"},{"name":"Nan Feng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Feng","id":"37087500887"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2446-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2447-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9563841","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiplexing","Integrated optics","NOMA","Passive optical networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["non-orthogonal multiple access","orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing access","PON","power ratio"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes the joint upstream nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA) scheme in the IM/DD-PON system structure.

The influences of the pulse energy and the slit width were studied, and after optimizing these parameters, the enlarged refractive index modulation (RIM) was produced. These RIMs were precisely assembled in a fiber core, generating highly localized FBGs with a comb of enhanced cladding mode resonances (30 dB) and a low insertion loss (0.3 dB). Note that the cladding mode resonance has a wide span of 240 nm in transmission spectrum. Furthermore, highly localized tilted fiber Bragg gratings (TFBGs) with various tilted angle can be fabricated to obtain a comb of selective enhanced cladding modes, via adjusting the tilted angle of the slit. Moreover, we investigated the thermal characteristics of the highly localized FBGs. The results show that such a device can withstand a temperature of 1000 \u00b0C.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 19th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563253/9563628/09563858.pdf","startPage":"01","endPage":"03","publicationTitle":"2021 19th International Conference on Optical Communications and Networks (ICOCN)","doi":"10.1109/ICOCN53177.2021.9563858","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOCN53177.2021.9563858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Silt-Beam Shaping Method for Femtosecond Laser Point-by-Point Inscription of Highly Localized Fiber Bragg Gratings with Enhanced Cladding Modes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature","Stability criteria","Refractive index","Insertion loss","Fiber gratings","Sensors","Laser beams"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["highly localized FBGs","cladding mode resonances","laser materials processing","slit beam shaping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Silt-Beam Shaping Method for Femtosecond Laser Point-by-Point Inscription of Highly Localized Fiber Bragg Gratings with Enhanced Cladding Modes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9563858/","publicationDate":"23 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","conferenceDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61875128"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Silt-Beam Shaping Method for Femtosecond Laser Point-by-Point Inscription of Highly Localized Fiber Bragg Gratings with Enhanced Cladding Modes","confLoc":"Qufu, China","sourcePdf":"229_manuscript.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043545S","chronDate":"23-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563253","isNumber":"9563628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563253","xplore-issue":"9563628","articleId":"9563858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9563885,"authors":[{"name":"Xiurong Ma","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xiurong","lastName":"Ma","id":"37598438800"},{"name":"Jingjing Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jingjing","lastName":"Li","id":"37088998849"},{"name":"Yunlong Shan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yunlong","lastName":"Shan","id":"37088975343"},{"name":"Yu Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37089001684"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2446-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2447-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9563885","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"abstract":"In this paper, a new training symbol structure consists of two adjacent training symbols is proposed to estimate transmitter in-phase/quadrature(IQ) mismatch and channel information in coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) system.

improving the performance of the communication networks in terms of the sender, channel, and receiver. One of these techniques, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) that improves transmission performance and channel access. NOMA completes performance in the receiver. This paper analyzes NOMA performance evaluation in two methods. The first method compares the efficiency of different types of NOMA receiver schemes such as Zero Forcing (ZF), Maximum Likelihood (ML), Sphere, and Minimum Mean Square-Error (MMSE). The second method changes the pattern of user sites for NOMA cell and suggests an optimal NOMA receiver scheme to serve users at the Cell Edge (CE) and obtain a greater user throughput rate. Simulation performed with the Vienna 5G Link Level Simulator (LLS), and modulation type used in encoding is Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Also, the low-density parity test (LDPC) coding is used. The results show the influence of the receivers, changing the receivers (ZF, MMSE) does not affect the throughput of the subscribers (UE3, UE4) when reaching transmitted power (17.14 dBm). Also, (MMSE and ZF) receivers achieve better user service performance in (CE) than Sphere type receiver by one-third of the percentage. While ML algorithm achieved similar performance as ZF, MMSE but at a transmitted power greater than (17.14 dBm).","doi":"10.1109/ICOIACT53268.2021.9563918","publicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Information and Communications Technology (ICOIACT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Information and Communications Technology (ICOIACT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563950/9563913/09563918.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOIACT53268.2021.9563918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of NOMA using different types Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563918/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of NOMA using different types Receivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"30 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9563918/","conferenceDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of NOMA using different types Receivers","confLoc":"Yogyakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570740154.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098423S","chronDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563950","isNumber":"9563913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563950","xplore-issue":"9563913","articleId":"9563918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9563967,"authors":[{"name":"Hasin Rehana","affiliation":["University of Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Hasin","lastName":"Rehana"},{"name":"Sayed Asaduzzaman","affiliation":["Rangamati Science and Technology University, Rangamati, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Sayed","lastName":"Asaduzzaman"},{"name":"Rana Chakma","affiliation":["Rangamati Science and Technology University, Rangamati, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Rana","lastName":"Chakma"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4923-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4924-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9563967","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","Three-dimensional displays","Machine learning algorithms","Feature extraction","Pattern recognition","Task analysis","Hyperspectral imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral Image","Neural Network","Feature Extraction","Deep Leaning"]}],"abstract":"The main challenge of processing Hyperspectral Image is its high dimensionality. Most of the machine learning classification algorithm's accuracy diminishes as the dimensionality of feature increases. As a result, for working with Hyperspectral image classification, complex feature reduction techniques are performed. The proposed architecture of CNN hierarchically constructs high-level features by seeking low dimensional representation of Hyperspectral interpretation in an automated way, instead of working with a full spectral band or complex handcrafted features. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to remove highly correlated spectral bands before feeding into the network. A combination of 3D and 2D convNet layers are used to preserve both the spectral and spatial information of the Hyperspectral data. A logistic regression layer is responsible for the classification task. The overall classification accuracy of the demonstrated approach is 99.43% which is much better than other conventional machine learning and deep learning methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9563967","publicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2021 5th International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2021 5th International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564090/9563966/09563967.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9563967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563966","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D-2D BCNN based Automated Feature Extraction & Classification for Hyperspectral Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563967/","displayDocTitle":"3D-2D BCNN based Automated Feature Extraction & Classification for Hyperspectral Imaging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9563967/","publicationDate":"16 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D-2D BCNN based Automated Feature Extraction & Classification for Hyperspectral Imaging","confLoc":"Kitakyushu, Japan","sourcePdf":"69F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099329S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564090","isNumber":"9563966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564090","xplore-issue":"9563966","articleId":"9563967","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9563974,"authors":[{"name":"Ike Verawati","affiliation":["Computer Science Faculty, Amikom Yogyakarta University, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Ike","lastName":"Verawati","id":"37089000658"},{"name":"Ivan Daniel Parlindungan Hasibuan","affiliation":["Computer Science Faculty, Amikom Yogyakarta University, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Ivan Daniel Parlindungan","lastName":"Hasibuan","id":"37089000279"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3394-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3393-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3395-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9563974","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["White blood cells","Red blood cells","Training data","Morphology","Cells (biology)","Medical services","Personnel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Human blood cells","red blood cells","white blood cells","Artificial Neural Network","Faster R-CNN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9563974","abstract":"Blood cells are an element found in the human body that has a function in the body's working mechanism.

In conducting the analysis of blood cells, it includes a series of laboratory tests, one of which is a test to determine the morphology of the blood cells. In laboratory tests carried out by doctors and medical personnel, it is usually still done manually, which has a low level of accuracy and precision. This can be caused by the knowledge, physical condition, and also the concentration of the doctor and also the laboratory staff, which makes it possible to get different analysis results. In manual laboratory tests, this can be overcome by creating an automated system that can classify human blood cells using artificial intelligence. In this research, the Faster R-CNN algorithm used 364 images of human blood cells. From the experiment above, the data is divided into 328 training data and also 36 testing data, it can be seen that Faster R-CNN has an accuracy of 94.92% in classifying human red blood cells and white blood cells.","doi":"10.1109/ICOIACT53268.2021.9563974","startPage":"86","endPage":"91","publicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Information and Communications Technology (ICOIACT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOIACT53268.2021.9563974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563913","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Information and Communications Technology (ICOIACT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563950/9563913/09563974.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Network in Classification of Human Blood Cells Using Faster R-CNN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9563974/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Network in Classification of Human Blood Cells Using Faster R-CNN","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9563974/","publicationDate":"30 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Network in Classification of Human Blood Cells Using Faster R-CNN","confLoc":"Yogyakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570742541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080965S","chronDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563950","isNumber":"9563913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563950","xplore-issue":"9563913","articleId":"9563974","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":9563980,"authors":[{"name":"Buyut Khoirul Umri","affiliation":["Magister of Informatics Engineering, University of Amikom Yogyakarta, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Buyut Khoirul","lastName":"Umri","id":"37088649215"},{"name":"Ema Utami","affiliation":["Magister of Informatics Engineering, University of Amikom Yogyakarta, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Ema","lastName":"Utami","id":"37086245218"},{"name":"Mei Parwanto Kurniawan","affiliation":["Falcuty of Computer Science, University of Amikom Yogyakrata, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Mei Parwanto","lastName":"Kurniawan","id":"37088355372"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3394-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3393-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3395-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9563980","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Histograms","Adaptive systems","Pandemics","Tools","Classification algorithms","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CNN","CLAHE","AHE","VGG19","Covid-19"]}],"abstract":"In 2021, Covid-19 is no longer a new threat for people in Indonesia and the world.

The best accuracy is obtained when using the Vertical Flip technique, the highest accuracy is obtained in both algorithms, namely 96.92% and 81.36% on the CNN and K-NN algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICOIACT53268.2021.9564000","startPage":"285","endPage":"289","publicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Information and Communications Technology (ICOIACT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOIACT53268.2021.9564000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563913","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Information and Communications Technology (ICOIACT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563950/9563913/09564000.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Augmentation on Batik Classification using Convolution Neural Network and K-Neareast Neighbor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564000/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Impact of Augmentation on Batik Classification using Convolution Neural Network and K-Neareast Neighbor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564000/","publicationDate":"30 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Augmentation on Batik Classification using Convolution Neural Network and K-Neareast Neighbor","confLoc":"Yogyakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570742667.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044434S","chronDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563950","isNumber":"9563913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563950","xplore-issue":"9563913","articleId":"9564000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":9564003,"authors":[{"name":"Omar Muhammad Altoumi Alsyaibani","affiliation":["Magister of Informatics Engineering, Universitas Amikom Yogyakarta, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Omar Muhammad Altoumi","lastName":"Alsyaibani","id":"37088999241"},{"name":"Ema Utami","affiliation":["Magister of Informatics Engineering, Universitas Amikom Yogyakarta, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Ema","lastName":"Utami","id":"37086245218"},{"name":"Anggit Dwi Hartanto","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Amikom Yogyakarta, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Anggit Dwi","lastName":"Hartanto","id":"37087047574"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3394-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3393-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3395-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564003","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Measurement","Intrusion detection","Stochastic processes","Production","Logic gates","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gated Recurrent Unit","CIC IDS 2017","Intrusion Detection System","Deep Learning IDS"]}],"abstract":"In this study, we proposed the Gated Recurrent Unit method to develop an Intrusion Detection System to detect traffic anomalies. This model was trained in several scenarios to get the best model. Scenario variations were carried out on the learning rate, the activation function and the optimization function. We used the CIC IDS 2017 dataset because it has the latest types of attacks. The dataset was divided into 3 parts, namely training, validation and a test with a ratio of 60%, 20% and 20% respectively. The model was compiled with a binary cross-entropy loss function. Measurement of the results was done using metric accuracy and F1 Score. The experimental result shows that the model with the highest accuracy is obtained from a model that used a learning rate of 0.0001, the LRelu activation function and the Adam optimization function with accuracy and the F1 score reaching 97.7739% and 97.7979% respectively. These results exceed the accuracy of previous studies on the same dataset and the same case classification. On the other hand, it can be concluded also from the study results that the models compiled using the Adam optimized have higher accuracy than the models compiled using Stochastic Gradient Descent. Our studies have not been able to figure out what types of attacks that the model detects. Therefore, we suggest conducting a further study of the multiclass classification case. In addition, further studies are also needed to increase the speed of the model in studying data so that it can be applied in real time to a production environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intrusion Detection System Model Based on Gated Recurrent Unit to Detect Anomaly Traffic","publicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Information and Communications Technology (ICOIACT)","doi":"10.1109/ICOIACT53268.2021.9564003","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 4th International Conference on Information and Communications Technology (ICOIACT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9563950/9563913/09564003.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICOIACT53268.2021.9564003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Intrusion Detection System Model Based on Gated Recurrent Unit to Detect Anomaly Traffic","conferenceDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564003/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","publicationDate":"30 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intrusion Detection System Model Based on Gated Recurrent Unit to Detect Anomaly Traffic","confLoc":"Yogyakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570717736.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083952S","chronDate":"30-31 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9563950","isNumber":"9563913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9563950","xplore-issue":"9563913","articleId":"9564003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9564024,"authors":[{"name":"Eric P.

In this paper, we consider the guesswork in the presence of quantum side information, and show that a general sequential guessing strategy is equivalent to performing a single quantum measurement and choosing a guessing strategy based on the outcome. We use this result to deduce entropic one-shot and asymptotic bounds on the guesswork in the presence of quantum side information, and to formulate a semi-definite program (SDP) to calculate the quantity. We evaluate the guesswork for a simple example involving the BB84 states, both numerically and analytically, and we prove a continuity result that certifies the security of slightly imperfect key states when the guesswork is used as the security criterion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564024/","volume":"68","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9564024/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Guesswork With Quantum Side Information","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information (CCIMI)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008294","fundingName":"Louisiana State University Economic Development Assistantship"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1907615"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guesswork With Quantum Side Information","sourcePdf":"tit-katariya-3118878-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115091S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9564024","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9564027,"authors":[{"name":"Ting-Lan Lin","affiliation":["National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9564027/tlin-3118806-small.gif","p":["Ting-Lan Lin (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Chung Yuan Christian University, Zhongli, Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 2001 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA, in 2010.

It can be displayed from different angles throughout time. However, the raw size of a point cloud is huge because there can be millions of points (each containing color triplet and location triplet information) in a point cloud, and there can be multiple point clouds in a DPC. Video-based point cloud compression (V-PCC) is developed to project a 3D point cloud to 2D images: attribute, geometry, and occupancy images. After padding, the 2D images are compressed using the well-established high-efficiency video coding (HEVC). In this study, we first employ an occupancy image to propose a blocky occupancy flag (BOF), to denote the occupancy information on \u201ca block basis\u201d. For coding attribute and geometry images, we use a BOF to develop a fast coding unit (CU) algorithm for early termination of the CU search recursion. We also utilize the geometry images to calculate the 2D and 3D information of each pixel, for 2D/3D spatial homogeneity of the pixels to design fast CU decision. In addition, we proposed a modified rate-distortion optimization for different color components considering the picture order count (POC) structure in HEVC/V-PCC. Finally, we propose an HEVC input pixel modification method based on a BOF to reduce the unnecessary information to be coded for attribute images. Compared with the state-of-the-art fast V-PCC encoding method, the proposed work outperforms by up to 2.31% in Bj\u00f8ntegaard delta bit rates (BDBR) (with very slight loss by only up to 0.38%), and improves the time saving performances by up to 7.84% for two different testing datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","startPage":"139109","endPage":"139121","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09564027.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Quadtree Search for HEVC Coding Units for V-PCC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Geometry","Three-dimensional displays","Image coding","Partitioning algorithms","Image reconstruction","Rate-distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video-based point cloud compression (V-PCC)","dynamic point cloud (DPC)","high efficiency video coding (HEVC)","fast coding unit~(CU) decision algorithm","occupancy map"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Quadtree Search for HEVC Coding Units for V-PCC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564027/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564027/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 106-2221-E-033-010, 107-2221-E-027-125, 108-2221-E-027-024, 109-2221-E-027-085 and 110-2221-E-027-044-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Efficient Quadtree Search for HEVC Coding Units for V-PCC","sourcePdf":"access-lin-3118806-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116395S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9564027","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9564028,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Chang","affiliation":["The 54th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC54), Shijiazhuang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9564028/chang-3118899-small.gif","p":["Xin Chang was born in Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China, in 1990.

However, effectiveness of traditional methods is limited to azimuth distance between two jammers. When the distance requirement is not satisfied, the jamming amplitude coefficients will be too high to be used by jammers. To overcome this disadvantage, a novel multiple-jammer deceptive jamming method is proposed. The intercepted radar signal is retransmitted and performed by amplitude and time-delay modulation. Then, jamming signal is first modeled as a polynomial function where the polynomial order is equal to the number of jammers. The interferometric phase difference between a moving target and a false target is utilized as an objective function, the azimuth relocated position difference between a moving target and a false target is utilized as the constraint to reduce computational burden, and the optimal jamming amplitude coefficients are estimated by solving the optimization problem based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO). Hereby, the optimal jamming amplitude coefficients and gain calculated with the proposed method will be lower than those calculated with traditional methods when the distance requirement is not satisfied. By utilizing the optimal coefficients and jamming amplitude gain, a false target generated with the proposed method will be detected by displaced phase center antenna (DPCA) technique and be relocated in the desired position by along-track interferometry (ATI) technique. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118899","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09564028.pdf","startPage":"138385","endPage":"138393","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiple-Jammer Deceptive Jamming Method Based on Particle Swarm Optimization Against Three-Channel SAR GMTI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Multiple-Jammer Deceptive Jamming Method Based on Particle Swarm Optimization Against Three-Channel SAR GMTI","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21176527","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564028/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2021M693002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Multiple-Jammer Deceptive Jamming Method Based on Particle Swarm Optimization Against Three-Channel SAR GMTI","sourcePdf":"access-chang-3118899-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09784S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9564028","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-06"},{"_id":9564033,"authors":[{"name":"Giha Yoon","affiliation":["Honam Research Center (HRC), Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Gwangju, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9564033/yoon-3118731-small.gif","p":["Giha Yoon received the B.S. degree in information and communications engineering from Mokpo National University, Jeollanam-do, South Korea, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in electronic computer engineering from the Graduate School, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, South Korea, in 2017.

However, the execution of computationally intensive DNN-based object detection workloads in mobile edge devices is insufficient in fulfilling the object detection requirements with high accuracy and low latency, owing to the limited computation capacity. In this paper, we implement and evaluate a DNN-based object detection offloading framework to improve the object detection performance of mobile edge devices by offloading computation-intensive workloads to a remote edge server. However, preliminary experimental results have shown that offloading all object detection workloads of mobile edge devices may lead to worse performance than executing the workloads locally. This degradation is obtained from the inefficient resource utilization in the edge computing architectures, both for the edge server and mobile edge devices. To resolve the aforementioned problem with degradation, we devise a device-aware DNN offloading decision algorithm that is aimed to maximize resource utilization in the edge computing architecture. The proposed algorithm decides whether or not to offload the object detection workloads of edge devices by considering their computing power and network bandwidth, and therefore maximizing their average object detection processing frames per second. Through various experiments conducted in a real-life wireless local area network (WLAN) environment, we verified the effectiveness of the proposed DNN-based object detection offloading framework.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118731","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09564033.pdf","startPage":"140199","endPage":"140211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Implementing Practical DNN-Based Object Detection Offloading Decision for Maximizing Detection Performance of Mobile Edge Devices","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564033/","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003696","fundingName":"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) grant"},{"fundingName":"Korean government.

In ALOHA-based random access, the packets usually include a field with a unique user address. However, when the number of users is massive and relatively small packets are transmitted, the overhead of including such field becomes restrictive. In unsourced random access (U-RA), the packets do not include any address field for the user, which maximizes the number of useful bits that are transmitted. However, by definition an U-RA protocol does not provide user identification. This letter presents a scheme that builds upon an underlying U-RA protocol and solves the problem of user identification and authentication. In our scheme, the users generate a message authentication code (MAC) that provides these functionalities without violating the main principle of unsourced random access: the selection of codewords from a common codebook is i.i.d. among all users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How to Identify and Authenticate Users in Massive Unsourced Random Access","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3118882","endPage":"3799","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9644612/09564037.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","startPage":"3795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3118882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9644612","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564037","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Authentication","Uplink","Codes","Media Access Protocol","Long Term Evolution","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive access","unsourced random access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"How to Identify and Authenticate Users in Massive Unsourced Random Access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564037/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"25","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9564037/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to Identify and Authenticate Users in Massive Unsourced Random Access","sourcePdf":"lcomm-kotaba-3118882-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058982S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9644612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9644612","articleId":"9564037","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":9564047,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Chen","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronics, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0001-8860-7023","id":"37085533252"},{"name":"Aitao Deng","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronics, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Aitao","lastName":"Deng","id":"37088994773"},{"name":"Long Zhang","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronics, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-4199-1106","id":"37087095965"},{"name":"Ruizi Li","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronics, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ruizi","lastName":"Li","id":"37088994701"},{"name":"Jing Yang","affiliation":["School of Physics and Electronics, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088995276"},{"name":"Hui Zhou","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhou","orcid":"0000-0002-8564-3851","id":"37405367800"},{"name":"Qinghui Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer and Communication, Hunan University of Technology, Zhuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Qinghui","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-4840-4875","id":"37085702919"},{"name":"Yun Cheng","affiliation":["Hunan University of Humanities, Science and Technology, Loudi, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37088994604"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"9564047","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"Filter bank multicarrier with offset quadrature amplitude modulation (FBMC/OQAM) can provide higher spectral efficiency and lower out-of-band spectral/power leakages than conventional orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing with QAM (OFDM/QAM).

In this work, channel-independent precoding techniques are employed for the short-reach FBMC/OQAM-based intensity-modulated and direct-detection (IMDD) system. Four commonly used precoding techniques are experimentally investigated in a directly-modulated laser-based IMDD FBMC/OQAM and OFDM/QAM systems over a 20-km fiber link. The relevant results exhibit that the receiver sensitivity of these two systems can be improved by about 2 dB with precoding techniques at the BER of 3.8e-3.

To address this issue, we propose an automatic segmentation model using double adversarial networks with a pyramidal pooling module. First, we introduce double adversarial networks that double-check whether the obtained segmentation results are similar to their ground truths owing to the special competing mechanism of adversarial learning, which contributes to the capturing of spatial information for segmentation and prompts the obtained samples to be more realistic, to improve the network segmentation performance. Second, we design a pyramidal pooling module to collect multi-level features and retain substantial information for segmentation in order to further boost the network performance. Finally, to assess the segmentation performance of our model, we use several indexes, namely the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard index, precision, and recall, as evaluation indicators. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms most existing pancreas segmentation methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118718","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09564056.pdf","startPage":"140965","endPage":"140974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Pancreas Segmentation Using Double Adversarial Networks With Pyramidal Pooling Module","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Pancreas Segmentation Using Double Adversarial Networks With Pyramidal Pooling Module","htmlLink":"/document/9564056/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Automatic Pancreas Segmentation Using Double Adversarial Networks With Pyramidal Pooling Module","sourcePdf":"access-shuxu-3118718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193476S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9564056","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9564066,"authors":[{"name":"Hengjia Wei","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Hengjia Wei received the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China, in 2014.","He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with Capital Normal University, Beijing, China, from 2014 to 2016, and a Research Fellow with the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, from 2016 to 2019.

Their success is mostly due to very efficient iterative decoding algorithms that require very little complexity. In this paper, we extend the density evolution (DE) analysis for PCs and SCs to a channel with ternary output and ternary message passing, where the third symbol marks an erasure. We investigate the performance of a standard error-and-erasure decoder and of its simplification using DE. The proposed analysis can be used to find component code configurations and quantizer levels for the channel output. We also show how the use of even-weight BCH subcodes as component codes can improve the decoding performance at high rates. The DE results are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations, which show that additional coding gains of up to 0.6dB are possible by ternary decoding, at only a small additional increase in complexity compared to traditional binary message passing.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3118789","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3118789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"32","endPage":"44","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09564072.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564072","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Decoding","Message passing","Iterative decoding","Complexity theory","Product codes","Encoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel coding","product codes","iterative decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Error-and-Erasure Decoding of Product and Staircase Codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9564072/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564072/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme","grantNumber":"101001899"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-and-Erasure Decoding of Product and Staircase Codes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-rapp-3118789-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103818S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9564072","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9564081,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Gabriel Villarreal-Cervantes","affiliation":["Centro de Innovaci\u00f3n y Desarrollo Tecnol\u00f3gico en C\u00f3mputo (CIDETEC), Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional, Mexico City, Mexico"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9564081/villa-3118658-small.gif","p":["Miguel Gabriel Villarreal-Cervantes (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Veracruz Technologic Institute, Veracruz, Mexico, in 2003, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Center for Research and Advanced Studies, CINVESTAV, Mexico City, Mexico, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.

One crucial issue is to reduce the times that the tuning process performs over time. In this work, a novel Asynchronous Adaptive Controller Tuning (AACT) approach is proposed to reduce the number of tuning process activations, and hence, this promotes resource savings in the overall computational cost for the tuning process. In this approach, an event function is designed to determine the control parameter update where the use of identification and predictive stages set the current control parameters. Furthermore, an elitist initialization in the differential evolution algorithm is also incorporated for solving the optimization problems at each stage. The speed regulation of the DC motor under disturbances is the study case in the ACCT approach. Comparative results with state-of-the-art bio-inspired algorithms in control tuning reveal in the AACT approach that the elitist initialization in differential evolution notably benefits the controller performance.

The optimum minimum mean square error processing can take advantage of large-scale fading coefficients for canceling the interference of pilot-sharing user-equipments and thus achieves asymptotically unbounded capacity. However, it is computationally demanding and can only be implemented in a fully centralized network. Here, sub-optimal schemes are derived that provide unbounded capacity with linear-growing complexity and using only local channel estimates but global channel statistics. This makes them suited for both centralized and distributed networks. In this latter case, the best performance is achieved with a generalized maximum ratio combiner that maximizes a capacity bound based on channel statistics

Currently, most test engineering processes in the industry are based on manual test case specification and the accumulation of certain test mile thresholds. This test engineering is very cost- and time-consuming. But especially the test case specification and selection is influenced by human bias. A promising potential approach to overcome those drawbacks is data-driven test case mining based on big data of sensor/actor recordings from real driving situations. The key challenge for data-driven test case mining, is handling the huge amount of data generated by the car sensors related to the open-world context of autonomous driving. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach to quantify events and situations which occur during recorded test drives by transforming multivariate time series data into a condensed, directed graph. This graphical model makes such events and situations comparable and enables the application of established coverage criteria and thus supports statistical statements regarding the coverage of potentially infinite operating environments. To illustrate the benefits of this approach, we conducted a quantitative evaluation in an industrial context in the domain of automated driving, including over 1000 km of field data. The overall results prove that a significant amount of the data characteristics do not get lost during the Graph transformation.","doi":"10.1109/AITEST52744.2021.00019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AITEST52744.2021.00019","startPage":"41","endPage":"48","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Testing (AITest)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564290/9564099/09564100.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Testing (AITest)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Trace-Graphs for Data-driven Test Case Mining in the Domain of Automated Driving","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Towards Trace-Graphs for Data-driven Test Case Mining in the Domain of Automated Driving","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564100/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564100/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Trace-Graphs for Data-driven Test Case Mining in the Domain of Automated Driving","confLoc":"Oxford, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"348100a041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078463S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564290","isNumber":"9564099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564290","xplore-issue":"9564099","articleId":"9564100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9564114,"authors":[{"name":"Rijad Sari\u0107","affiliation":["School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, La Trobe University (LTU), Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Rijad","lastName":"Sari\u0107","id":"37086397489"},{"name":"Junchao Chen","affiliation":["IHP - Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr innovative Mikroelektronik, Frankfurt, Oder, Germany","University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Junchao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37087047921"},{"name":"Milo\u0161 Krsti\u0107","affiliation":["IHP - Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr innovative Mikroelektronik, Frankfurt, Oder, Germany","University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany"],"firstName":"Milo\u0161","lastName":"Krsti\u0107","id":"37266672400"},{"name":"Edhem \u010custovi\u0107","affiliation":["School of Computing, Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, La Trobe University (LTU), Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Edhem","lastName":"\u010custovi\u0107","id":"38017260600"},{"name":"Goran Pani\u0107","affiliation":["IHP - Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr innovative Mikroelektronik, Frankfurt, Oder, Germany"],"firstName":"Goran","lastName":"Pani\u0107","id":"37991657800"},{"name":"Jasmin Kevri\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, International Burch University (IBU), Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Jasmin","lastName":"Kevri\u0107","id":"37086037773"},{"name":"Dejan Joki\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, International Burch University (IBU), Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina"],"firstName":"Dejan","lastName":"Joki\u0107","id":"38547410000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2099-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2100-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564114","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning algorithms","Radiation hardening (electronics)","Measurement uncertainty","Single event upsets","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms","Hardware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["solar particle event","single event upset","space systems reliability","supervised machine learning"]}],"abstract":"Solar Particle Events (SPEs) generate cosmic radiation of different magnitude in a time span of several hours or even days. This contributes to an increased probability of higher magnitude Single-Event Upsets (SEUs) occurrence in space applications. It is critical to establish early detection of SEU rate or Soft Error Rate (SRE) changes to enable timely radiation hardening measures. This research paper focuses on the high-accuracy detection of SPEs using the manually collected space data. Additionally, the prediction of SRE increase or decrease was established with the seven widely used supervised machine learning algorithms.

To overcome this issue, we present an unsupervised feature extraction algorithm for multivariate time series, called UFEKT (Unsupervised Feature Extraction using Kernel Method and Tucker Decomposition). Our algorithm (1) constructs a kernel matrix from subsequences of each time series to account for time-wise association and (2) constructs a single tensor from the kernel matrices and performs Tucker decomposition to account for variable-wise association. Feature representation is obtained as rows of the factor matrix of the decomposed tensor in a fully unsupervised manner, which can be used to subsequent machine learning problems. Our experimental results using synthetic and real-world multivariate time series datasets in the unsupervised outlier detection scenario show that our algorithm improves detection accuracy when it is used as pre-processing for outlier detection algorithms.","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 8th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 8th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564091/9564109/09564117.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","doi":"10.1109/DSAA53316.2021.9564117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSAA53316.2021.9564117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Tensor based Feature Extraction and Outlier Detection for Multivariate Time Series","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Tensor based Feature Extraction and Outlier Detection for Multivariate Time Series","htmlLink":"/document/9564117/","publicationDate":"6 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001695","fundingName":"JST"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009023","fundingName":"PRESTO","grantNumber":"JPMJPR1855"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Tensor based Feature Extraction and Outlier Detection for Multivariate Time Series","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"2021154419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094866S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564091","isNumber":"9564109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564091","xplore-issue":"9564109","articleId":"9564117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9564125,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

They are used to transport cargo from more than 30,000 cargo ships sailing across the world. The shipping containers provide the best protection of goods. This is because once all the goods are loaded into the container, it is sealed completely. The objective of the container seal is to minimize the risk of someone accessing the container and taking cargo out and avoid someone putting illegal stuff into the container such as drugs, weapons of mass destruction. To this end, shipping container terminals are required to inspect security seals when containers pass the gate of intermodal terminals. The existing detection mechanism is based on the human visual system which is time-consuming and hazardous. In this paper, a deep learning-based framework is proposed to automate shipping container security seal detection. The proposed method consists of three components including, handlers and cam keepers detection, handlers and cam keepers super-resolution regions, and security seal classification. For handlers and cam keepers detection you only look once (Yolov5) is employed to detect them with high performance. Following that, the laplacian pyramid super-resolution network (LapSRN) image super-resolution technique is used to convert low-resolution handlers and cam keepers regions to high-resolution sub-images. Finally, EfficientNetB0 is employed to classify the super-resolution sub-images based on two categories, seal or no-seal. The proposed whole security seal detection system is trained end-to-end that can localize and recognize the regions containing security seals with high performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9564154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9564154","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2021 5th International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564090/9563966/09564154.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2021 5th International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning-based Framework for Shipping Container Security Seal Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning-based Framework for Shipping Container Security Seal Detection","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","publicationDate":"16 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564154/","accessionNumber":"21257029","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564154/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning-based Framework for Shipping Container Security Seal Detection","confLoc":"Kitakyushu, Japan","sourcePdf":"31F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091929S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564090","isNumber":"9563966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564090","xplore-issue":"9563966","articleId":"9564154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":9564183,"authors":[{"name":"Arowa Yasmeen","affiliation":["Islamic University of Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Arowa","lastName":"Yasmeen"},{"name":"Fariha Ishrat Rahman","affiliation":["Islamic University of Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Fariha Ishrat","lastName":"Rahman"},{"name":"Sabbir Ahmed","affiliation":["Islamic University of Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Sabbir","lastName":"Ahmed"},{"name":"Md.

In conversational Bengali, it is quite common to speak in a mixture of English and Bengali, a phenomenon termed Code-switching (CS). To build a Voice Command Classifier in this era, when the usage of CS is ever-increasing, it is often necessary to map a single base command to its many different variants - spoken in multiple mixtures of languages. The works done with Bengali Speech have been primarily focused on single word classification and mostly incompetent in understanding the complex semantic relationships displayed in sentences. This paper proposes \u2018CSVC-Net\u2019, a CNN-LSTM based architecture for classifying spoken commands that exhibit code-switching between Bengali and English. To effectively reflect the scenario, it also presents a newly curated dataset named \u2018Banglish\u2019 containing 3,840 audio files of spoken computer commands belonging to 11 classes, considering 64 variations in total. The proposed pipeline passes the input audio signal through a series of appropriate transformation and augmentation steps enabling the model to achieve an accuracy of 92.08% on the curated dataset. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed model has been justified by comparing with different architectures and tested under different noise levels with promising accuracy, which shows the applicability of the model in real-life scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9564183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9564183","publicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2021 5th International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2021 5th International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564090/9563966/09564183.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"CSVC-Net: Code-Switched Voice Command Classification using Deep CNN-LSTM Network","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564183/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","publicationDate":"16 Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CSVC-Net: Code-Switched Voice Command Classification using Deep CNN-LSTM Network","confLoc":"Kitakyushu, Japan","sourcePdf":"116F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086456S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564090","isNumber":"9563966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564090","xplore-issue":"9563966","articleId":"9564183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9564196,"authors":[{"name":"Fuchen Gao","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fuchen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37088997340"},{"name":"Zhanquan Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhanquan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37834345500"},{"name":"Zhenguang Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Zhenguang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086076169"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2099-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2100-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564196","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Solid modeling","Correlation","Convolution","Logic gates","Predictive models","Data science"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Passenger volume prediction","Graph convolutional network","traffic patterns","spatial-temporal correlation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564196","abstract":"Accurate prediction of metro passenger volume (number of passengers) is valuable to realize real-time metro system management, which is a pivotal yet challenging task in intelligent transportation. Due to the complex spatial correlation and temporal variation of urban subway ridership behavior, deep learning has been widely used to capture nonlinear spatial-temporal dependencies. Unfortunately, the current deep learning methods only adopt graph convolutional network as a component to model spatial relationship, without making full use of the different spatial correlation patterns between stations. In order to further improve the accuracy of metro passenger volume prediction, a deep learning model composed of Parallel multi-graph convolution and stacked Bidirectional unidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (PB-GRU) was proposed in this paper. The parallel multi-graph convolution captures the origin-destination (OD) distribution and similar flow pattern between the metro stations, while bidirectional gated recurrent unit considers the passenger volume sequence in forward and backward directions and learns complex temporal features. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets of subway passenger flow show the efficacy of the model. Surprisingly, compared with the existing methods, PB-GRU achieves much lower prediction error.","doi":"10.1109/DSAA53316.2021.9564196","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 8th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSAA53316.2021.9564196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564109","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 8th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564091/9564109/09564196.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Multi-Graph Convolution Network For Metro Passenger Volume Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564196/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parallel Multi-Graph Convolution Network For Metro Passenger Volume Prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564196/","publicationDate":"6 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Multi-Graph Convolution Network For Metro Passenger Volume Prediction","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"2021167529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067486S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564091","isNumber":"9564109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564091","xplore-issue":"9564109","articleId":"9564196","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9564198,"authors":[{"name":"Sashank Sridhar","affiliation":["College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Sashank","lastName":"Sridhar","id":"37088460503"},{"name":"Sowmya Sanagavarapu","affiliation":["College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Sowmya","lastName":"Sanagavarapu","id":"37088461305"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4923-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4924-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564198","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564198","abstract":"Recommendation systems are widespread with the big data hosted on the internet and the users who actively access them. The recommendation model implemented here uses the weights of a trained Bi-LSTM ANN model that was used for multiclass news categorization and feeds these weights to a k-NN clustering algorithm. The k-NN based recommendation engine uses cosine similarity between the gradient activation maps for identifying the articles with highest similarity to the others to feed them as suggestions to the user on the platform.

Heart diseases have emerged as one of the leading causes of death all over the world. According to the world health organization (WHO), millions of people are dying every year from heart-related diseases. A classification model that can early detect arrhythmia will be able to reduce this number by manyfold. Many researchers are working in this area and proposed many deep learning and machine Learning based models for arrhythmia classification. These models have high accuracy but require a machine with high computational power. Hence, these models are not sustainable options for the practical field. In this paper, we have proposed a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with high accuracy and low computational complexity. Our proposed methodology is appraised on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. We achieved overall 98.25% accuracy into five classes with an f1 score of 98.24%, precision 97.58%, and recall 96.79% which is better than previous results classifying arrhythmia. We can claim that our proposed method is better than most other existing models because of the higher accuracy with a simple architecture that can be run on an edge device with relatively low hardware configuration.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9564201","publicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2021 5th International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2021 5th International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564090/9563966/09564201.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9564201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG Arrhythmia Classification Using 1D CNN Leveraging the Resampling Technique and Gaussian Mixture Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"ECG Arrhythmia Classification Using 1D CNN Leveraging the Resampling Technique and Gaussian Mixture Model","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564201/","publicationDate":"16 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564201/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG Arrhythmia Classification Using 1D CNN Leveraging the Resampling Technique and Gaussian Mixture Model","confLoc":"Kitakyushu, Japan","sourcePdf":"95F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07746S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564090","isNumber":"9563966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564090","xplore-issue":"9563966","articleId":"9564201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9564204,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmudul Hasan","affiliation":["University of Asia Pacific, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mahmudul","lastName":"Hasan","id":"37088996650"},{"name":"Rokhshana-Nishat-Anzum","affiliation":["University of Asia Pacific, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"lastName":"Rokhshana-Nishat-Anzum","id":"37089001459"},{"name":"Samina Yasmin","affiliation":["University of Asia Pacific, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Samina","lastName":"Yasmin","id":"37089001434"},{"name":"Tanmoy Sarkar Pias","affiliation":["Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA"],"firstName":"Tanmoy Sarkar","lastName":"Pias","id":"37086601418"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4923-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4924-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564204","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Emotion recognition","Neurons","Brain modeling","Feature extraction","Electroencephalography","Pattern recognition","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EEG","emotion recognition","CNN","DEAP","FFT"]}],"abstract":"Emotions are mental states originating in the human brain, and this is closely related to the activities of the nervous system. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a well-established approach to record neuron activities which is reliable for emotion recognition compared to the non-physiological clues. So far, there have been reports of various researches searching for active patterns involving different emotions. However, most of the previously published system could only classify 4 human emotions using the technique of binary classification but humans have more and complex emotions which couldn't be captured with only 4 classes. So, we proposed a fine-grained emotion classification technique which can classify 64 emotions including all the complex emotions. Hence, this paper presents convolutional neural network (CNN) models working on the DEAP dataset, and it contains emotional states which are arousal, valence, dominance and liking. Our binary models achieved 96.63% and 96.18% accuracy respectively for valence and arousal. Only four emotions are found with binary classification whereas 8-class classification can precisely recognize 64 emotions. The 8-class classification achieves a promising accuracy of 93.83 % and 93.79% respectively for valence and arousal. For both cases, Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) has been used as the feature extraction method and all the four classification models are created under 1D-CNN using the same architecture.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9564204","publicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2021 5th International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2021 5th International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564090/9563966/09564204.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9564204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563966","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fine-Grained Emotion Recognition from EEG Signal Using Fast Fourier Transformation and CNN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564204","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fine-Grained Emotion Recognition from EEG Signal Using Fast Fourier Transformation and CNN","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564204/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"16 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564204/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fine-Grained Emotion Recognition from EEG Signal Using Fast Fourier Transformation and CNN","confLoc":"Kitakyushu, Japan","sourcePdf":"96F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08124S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564090","isNumber":"9563966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564090","xplore-issue":"9563966","articleId":"9564204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9564215,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Sibtain Hamayun","affiliation":["Microsoft, Dubai, UAE"],"firstName":"Muhammad Sibtain","lastName":"Hamayun","id":"38241269000"},{"name":"Olga Ivina","affiliation":["Microsoft, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Olga","lastName":"Ivina","id":"37089001146"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2099-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2100-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564215","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context-aware services","Computer vision","Costs","Conferences","Redundancy","Streaming media","Data science"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Edge compute","high availability","computer vision","context aware","resource allocation","pattern recognition"]}],"abstract":"Managing High Availability (HA) among Computer Vision Systems deployed on Edge devices requires expensive hardware redundancy. The cost of scaling such systems becomes prohibitive. We present an alternative approach for managing high availability by building this capacity at an application layer. To this end, we propose the use of pattern recognition components to make the application context aware. This intelligent application is then itself able to decide which Edge modules are running redundant or less significant processes. For example, if the module is processing uneventful video streams, the application may decide to make this compute available to some other module. In the event of hardware failures, this application can then provision workloads on idle hardware (or hardware running less significant workload).","doi":"10.1109/DSAA53316.2021.9564215","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 8th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 8th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564091/9564109/09564215.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSAA53316.2021.9564215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564109","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Resource Allocation driven by pattern recognition to attain High Availability in Vision based Edge Compute Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Resource Allocation driven by pattern recognition to attain High Availability in Vision based Edge Compute Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564215/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"6 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564215/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Resource Allocation driven by pattern recognition to attain High Availability in Vision based Edge Compute Systems","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"2021204953.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07623S","chronDate":"6-9 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564091","isNumber":"9564109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564091","xplore-issue":"9564109","articleId":"9564215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9564228,"authors":[{"name":"Jakub Jakubowski","affiliation":["Arcelor Mittal Poland and AGH University of Science and Technology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Jakub","lastName":"Jakubowski","id":"37089000348"},{"name":"Przemys\u0142aw Stanisz","affiliation":["Arcelor Mittal Poland, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Przemys\u0142aw","lastName":"Stanisz","id":"37088995876"},{"name":"Szymon Bobek","affiliation":["Jagiellonian Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (JAHCAI) and Institute of Applied Computer Science Jagiellonian University, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Szymon","lastName":"Bobek","orcid":"0000-0002-6350-8405","id":"38232489200"},{"name":"Grzegorz J.

We have had significant breakthroughs in the development of autonomous cars within the last ten years. However, despite the success of multiple prototypes in navigating within the borders of a delimited area, researchers are yet to overcome several drawbacks before embodying them in the transport system; and one of those hurdles lies in the lane detection system of the cars. Therefore, in this article, we present an intelligent lane detection algorithm incorporating fully-connected Neural Networks with a secondary layer protection scheme to detect the borders of a lane. We achieved over 98% classification accuracy using the proposed lane detection model. We also implemented the model in a small prototype to take a look at its performance. Experimental results infer that the algorithm is capable of lane detection and ready for practical use.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9564229","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564090/9563966/09564229.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2021 5th International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)","publicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2021 5th International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9564229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Vision-Based Lane Detection Approach for Autonomous Vehicles Using a Convolutional Neural Network Architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Vision-Based Lane Detection Approach for Autonomous Vehicles Using a Convolutional Neural Network Architecture","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","publicationDate":"16 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564229/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003565","fundingName":"Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport","grantNumber":"21CTAP-C163815-01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Vision-Based Lane Detection Approach for Autonomous Vehicles Using a Convolutional Neural Network Architecture","confLoc":"Kitakyushu, Japan","sourcePdf":"127F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092886S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564090","isNumber":"9563966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564090","xplore-issue":"9563966","articleId":"9564229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9564240,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

We have achieved 0.0165 Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) on the training set and 0.13515 on the validation set.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Costs","Medical treatment","Feature extraction","Skeleton","Convolutional neural networks","Data mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["1D LBP","Genetic Algorithm","CNN","Feature Engineering","rehabilitation exercise","KIMORE"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564240","doi":"10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9564240","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2021 5th International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics & Vision (ICIEV) and 2021 5th International Conference on Imaging, Vision & Pattern Recognition (icIVPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564090/9563966/09564240.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9563966","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9564240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564240/","displayDocTitle":"Automated Rehabilitation Exercise Assessment by Genetic Algorithm-optimized CNN","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"16 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564240/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Rehabilitation Exercise Assessment by Genetic Algorithm-optimized CNN","confLoc":"Kitakyushu, Japan","sourcePdf":"128F.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057527S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564090","isNumber":"9563966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564090","xplore-issue":"9563966","articleId":"9564240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9564242,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4923-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4924-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564242","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Image recognition","System performance","Semantics","Lightweight structures","Network architecture","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Neural Network","Image Recognition","Lightweight","Skip Connection","Attention Module","Feature Fuse","Feature Selection","Semantic Segmentation","Objective Detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564242","abstract":"We propose a new network architecture with dense connection and feature selection (LDSNet) in this work. The LDSNet maintains lightweight while improving system accuracy on image recognition. In the proposed network, we introduce a feature selection module (FSM), which is designed to guide and filter features adaptively according to the global semantic information. Our network does not adopt the traditional linear connection, but iteratively uses the dense skip connection between layers in each stage. The LDSNet integrates features from multiple layers while maintains a compact structure. We verify the proposed LDSNet and the feature selection module on several datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Compared with other lightweight networks, our experiments show that LDSNet achieves a good balance between accuracy and parameters. In addition, our method can be applied to different models to improve the performance of other visual tasks. For example, utilization of FSM module on the DeepLab v3+ for semantic segmentation gains competitive results, which has proved the wide applicability of our method.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEVicIVPR52578.2021.9564242","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564090/9563966/09564242.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Joint 10th International Conference

when they are used in safety-critical domains. In particular, in the latest years, the focus of validation has been put on assessing the robustness of CNNs, i.e., their ability to correctly classify perturbed input data. A way to measure robustness is to check the network accuracy over many datasets obtained by altering the input data in different ways, but this is time and resource-consuming. In this paper, we present ASAP, a method to efficiently compute the robustness of a CNN, exploiting a parabola-based approximation which allows to adaptively select only relevant alteration levels. The method is tested on two different benchmarks (MNIST and breast cancer classification). Moreover, we compare ASAP with other techniques based on uniform sampling, numerical integration, and random sampling.","doi":"10.1109/AITEST52744.2021.00015","startPage":"21","endPage":"28","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Testing (AITest)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564290/9564099/09564330.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Testing (AITest)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AITEST52744.2021.00015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Computation of Robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Computational modeling","Benchmark testing","Particle measurements","Robustness","Time measurement","Breast cancer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional Neural Networks","robustness","efficient robustness computation","image classification","alteration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564330/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Computation of Robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564330/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Computation of Robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"Oxford, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"348100a021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084669S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564290","isNumber":"9564099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564290","xplore-issue":"9564099","articleId":"9564330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":9564348,"authors":[{"name":"Marcel Dix","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research Center, Industrial Data Analytics, Ladenburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Dix","id":"37330586500"},{"name":"Ashish Chouhan","affiliation":["Big Data and Business Analytics, SRH University, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Chouhan","id":"37087102634"},{"name":"Srishti Ganguly","affiliation":["Big Data and Business Analytics, SRH University, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Srishti","lastName":"Ganguly","id":"37088998701"},{"name":"Sripada Pradhan","affiliation":["Big Data and Business Analytics, SRH University, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Sripada","lastName":"Pradhan","id":"37089001127"},{"name":"Devika Saraswat","affiliation":["Big Data and Business Analytics, SRH University, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Devika","lastName":"Saraswat","id":"37088998966"},{"name":"Surbhi Agrawal","affiliation":["Big Data and Business Analytics, SRH University, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Surbhi","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37088998125"},{"name":"Ajinkya Prabhune","affiliation":["Big Data and Business Analytics, SRH University, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Ajinkya","lastName":"Prabhune","id":"37087102043"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3483-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3484-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564348","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":28},"abstract":"Industrial process control systems collect a vast amount of production data, especially time-series data from various sensors in a plant. This data provides a plethora of potential use cases for AI and machine learning that can help plant operators better understand and predict complex plant situations and thereby run their plants more effectively and safely. A relevant use case is anomaly detection, due to the time and cost-intensive process of detecting and rectifying issues, e.g., plant equipment failures. In this paper, the anomaly detection problem for multivariate industrial time-series data is addressed with the help of neural network architectures. In particular, three architectures are evaluated and compared: Dense Autoencoders, LSTM Autoencoders, and LSTMs. The evaluation is performed to detect 20 simulated plant equipment failures for a real-world industrial process found in oil production fields, called the three-phase separator process. The evaluation is done by 1) measuring to what extent the anomaly detection models succeed in detecting the anomalies, and 2) how well the models are able to explain the anomaly root cause. The main contribution of this paper is to find an anomaly detection model that is best suited for the detection and explanation of various failure cases in such an industrial process setting. The evaluation results show the quantitative comparison of the three models metrics and their performances. Here, it is observed that the Dense Autoencoders performed best for the given 20 failure cases.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications (BigDataService)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564289/9564092/09564348.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"228","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications (BigDataService)","doi":"10.1109/BigDataService52369.2021.00035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BigDataService52369.2021.00035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly detection in the time-series data of industrial plants using neural network architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle separators","Oils","Neural networks","Measurement uncertainty","Computer architecture","Production","Machine learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","explainable AI (XAI)","industrial process plants","multivariate time-series data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly detection in the time-series data of industrial plants using neural network architectures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564348/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly detection in the time-series data of industrial plants using neural network architectures","confLoc":"Oxford, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"348300a222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071001S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564289","isNumber":"9564092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564289","xplore-issue":"9564092","articleId":"9564348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9564352,"authors":[{"name":"Pantelis A.

Our framework aims to support services of arbitrary structure and complexity, dynamically configured and fluidly deployed along a heterogeneous device-to-cloud compute continuum, and operating according to provider and user intent. It features inherent privacy enhancements and aims to give users more control over their resources and data.

However, advances in machine learning research indicate that neural networks can be powerful data modeling techniques, as they can provide higher accuracy for a plethora of learning problems and datasets. In the past, they have been tried on time-series forecasting as well, but their overall results have not been significantly better than the statistical models especially for intermediate length times-series data. Their modeling capacities are limited in cases where enough data may not be available to estimate the large number of parameters that these non-linear models require. This paper presents an easy to implement data augmentation method to significantly improve the performance of such networks. Our method, Augmented-Neural-Network, which involves using forecasts from statistical models, can help unlock the power of neural networks on intermediate length time-series and produces competitive results. It shows that data augmentation, when paired with Automated Machine Learning techniques such as Neural Architecture Search, can help to find the best neural architecture for a given time-series. Using the combination of these, demonstrates significant enhancement in the forecasting accuracy of three neural network-based models for a COVID-19 dataset, with a maximum improvement in forecasting accuracy by 21.41%, 24.29%, and 16.42%, respectively, over the neural networks that do not use augmented data.","doi":"10.1109/BigDataService52369.2021.00006","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications (BigDataService)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BigDataService52369.2021.00006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564092","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Seventh International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications (BigDataService)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564289/9564092/09564380.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Neural Networks for Time-Series Forecasting using Data Augmentation and AutoML","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564380/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improving Neural Networks for Time-Series Forecasting using Data Augmentation and AutoML","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564380/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Neural Networks for Time-Series Forecasting using Data Augmentation and AutoML","confLoc":"Oxford, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"348300a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108608S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564289","isNumber":"9564092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564289","xplore-issue":"9564092","articleId":"9564380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9564389,"authors":[{"name":"Mengli Zhao","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Mengli","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37088999921"},{"name":"Xuejie Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xuejie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088999312"},{"name":"Yanling Jin","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yanling","lastName":"Jin","id":"37089000468"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3483-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3484-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564389","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Temperature","Time series analysis","Noise reduction","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Numerical models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet threshold denoising","Bidirectional long short-term memory neural network","Attention mechanism","Passenger flow forecast","Time series"]}],"abstract":"Subway Passenger flow forecasting is an essential task of intelligent traffic. In view of the periodic, nonlinear and explosive characteristics of subway passenger flow, a multidimensional passenger flow forecast method is designed to incorporate wavelet transform and deep learning.

The new approach is underpinned by an easy-to-compute commonality metric that supports the detection of rare subclasses, and comprises methods for reducing the impact of these subclasses during both model training and model exploitation. We demonstrate our approach using two well-known datasets, MNIST's handwritten digits and Kaggle's cats/dogs, identifying rare subclasses and producing models which compensate for subclass rarity. In addition we demonstrate how our run-time approach increases the ability of users to identify samples likely to be misclassified at run-time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Measurement","Computational modeling","Conferences","Neural networks","Decision making"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Networks","Rare Subclasses","Balanced Data"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AITEST52744.2021.00012","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Testing (AITest)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Testing (AITest)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564290/9564099/09564390.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AITEST52744.2021.00012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and Mitigation of Rare Subclasses in Deep Neural Network Classifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection and Mitigation of Rare Subclasses in Deep Neural Network Classifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564390/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564390/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and Mitigation of Rare Subclasses in Deep Neural Network Classifiers","confLoc":"Oxford, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"348100a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077585S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564290","isNumber":"9564099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564290","xplore-issue":"9564099","articleId":"9564390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9564419,"authors":[{"name":"He Jing","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Jing"},{"name":"Yongqiang Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yongqiang","lastName":"Cheng"},{"name":"Hao Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Xingwei Cao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xingwei","lastName":"Cao"},{"name":"Hongqiang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Hongqiang","lastName":"Wang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2918-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2917-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2919-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564419","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564419","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Deep learning","Time-frequency analysis","Neural networks","Stacking","Radar detection","Radar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radar target detection","neural network","ensemble","IPIX radar"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564419","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564394/9564402/09564419.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radar Target Detection Method Based on Neural Network Ensemble","abstract":"The detection of small target in radar echo has important application value in military and civil fields.

In order to make full use of radar echo information and reduce the influence of training samples on detection effect, a radar target detection method based on neural network ensemble is proposed.

This paper proposes a channel estimation algorithm based on deep learning theory, which is different from the traditional orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system in which the channel state information is estimated first. And then the estimated channel state information (CSI) is used to design the equalization module. In the process of restoring the transmission signal, this paper designs and uses a five-layer fully connected neural network to restore the useful information transmitted by the measurement and control station to the satellite in an end-to-end manner. The simulation results show that the channel estimation algorithm based on deep learning can effectively reduce the use of pilots, submit spectrum utilization, and reduce the system error rate. When pilots with the same length as the signal are used in OFDM symbols, the bit error rate performance of channel estimation algorithms based on deep learning is better than the traditional Least Squares (LS) algorithm. The performance of the LMMSE (Linear Minimum Mean Square Error) algorithm is equivalent to the proposed algorithm also in terms of bit error rate. When the pilot sequence length is reduced to 1/8 of the OFDM symbol, the algorithm proposed in this paper is far superior to the traditional Channel estimation algorithm. This result can be seen that the algorithm can greatly improve the spectral efficiency by reducing the use of pilots.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564465","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564394/9564402/09564465.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-OFDM channel detection algorithm in multi-station and multi-satellite uplink system based on deep learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564465/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-OFDM channel detection algorithm in multi-station and multi-satellite uplink system based on deep learning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"17 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564465/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-OFDM channel detection algorithm in multi-station and multi-satellite uplink system based on deep learning","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2530_Final_paper_submission.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06371S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564394","isNumber":"9564402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564394","xplore-issue":"9564402","articleId":"9564465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9564493,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyue Xiang","affiliation":["National Electric Power Conversion and Control Engineering Technology Research Center Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xinyue","lastName":"Xiang"},{"name":"Feng Zhao","affiliation":["National Electric Power Conversion and Control Engineering Technology Research Center Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zhao"},{"name":"Boya Peng","affiliation":["Electric Power Research Institute of Guangxi Power Grid Co., Ltd, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Boya","lastName":"Peng"},{"name":"Hao Qiu","affiliation":["Electric Power Research Institute of Guangxi Power Grid Co., Ltd, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Qiu"},{"name":"Zhenhua Tan","affiliation":["National Electric Power Conversion and Control Engineering Technology Research Center Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhenhua","lastName":"Tan"},{"name":"Zhikang Shuai","affiliation":["National Electric Power Conversion and Control Engineering Technology Research Center Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhikang","lastName":"Shuai"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2918-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2917-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2919-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564493","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564493","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Conferences","High-voltage techniques","Signal processing","Real-time systems","Data models","Safety"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-voltage scene","YOLO v4","object detection","scene detection","risk detection","DoI"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564493","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564394/9564402/09564493.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","startPage":"01","endPage":"05","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A YOLO-v4-Based Risk Detection Method for Power High Voltage Operation Scene","abstract":"Power accidents may occur during the period of power operation, which threatens the safety of power operators. It is important to supervise the power operation scene and the safety of workers. Traditional monitoring method for power operation relies on camera and manual operation, which is tedious, labour-intensive and error-prone. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a risk detection method of highvoltage power operation scene based on YOLO v4. Firstly, it selects a specific object \u201chand-held high-voltage joystick\u201d as the identification object of the high-voltage operation scene.

Unfortunately, there is no accurate channel model in underwater acoustic (UWA) communications. The mismatch between the training data set and the test environment degrades the receiver performance for UWA communications. Considering that the classical receiver contains channel estimation, equalization and demodulation tasks that are mutually dependent, in this paper, we propose a novel receiver, called TaskNet, based on multi-task learning (MTL) to improve the DL-receiver's generalization performance. To demonstrate the advantages of TaskNet, we establish a baseband UWA channel impulse response (CIR) dataset, which includes both simulated and measured CIRs, and make comparison with the classical single-task based DL-receivers inlcuding FC-DNN and ComNet. Through analysis and simulation results, the proposed MTL based DL-receiver is proved to have a better generalization performance than the single-task based ones, whether the signal suffers nonlinear damage, or the training set does not match the real channel.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Task Learning Based Underwater Acoustic OFDM Communications","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564511","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564394/9564402/09564511.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564511/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Task Learning Based Underwater Acoustic OFDM Communications","conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564511/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","publicationDate":"17 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100016098","fundingName":"Program of Marine Economy Development"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Task Learning Based Underwater Acoustic OFDM Communications","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2302_Final_paper_submission.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065946S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564394","isNumber":"9564402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564394","xplore-issue":"9564402","articleId":"9564511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9564519,"authors":[{"name":"Yaqing Xue","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yaqing","lastName":"Xue","id":"37089005145"},{"name":"Guiyang Luo","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guiyang","lastName":"Luo","id":"37085878076"},{"name":"Quan Yuan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085420201"},{"name":"Jinglin Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinglin","lastName":"Li","id":"37676311700"},{"name":"Fangchun Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fangchun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37292382500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564519","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564519","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Industries","Correlation","Tracking","Network topology","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Trajectory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564519","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564519.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","startPage":"2958","endPage":"2964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ST-Tracking: Spatial-temporal Graph Convolution Neural Network for Multi-object Tracking","abstract":"Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) which aims to estimate trajectories for objects of interest in videos, is a crucial component in intelligent transportation systems and has gained considerable attention from both academia and industry. However, existing MOT approaches apply simple motion and appearance features, ignoring the spatial-temporal correlations of interactions with other objects. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel MOT framework ST-Tracking to extract spatial-temporal features for tracking objects, which is trained in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, a directed graph is first constructed to represent the spatial-temporal correlations, where the node attributes include both geometric and appearance features, and the edges are deliberately defined to embrace location and topology cues. Then, a spatial-temporal graph convolutional module is proposed to aggregate information from both spatial and temporal dimensions, thus extracting discriminative features. Extensive experiments on the challenging KITTI benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and superior of ST-Tracking as compared with several state-of-the-art methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564519/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564519/","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"ST-Tracking: Spatial-temporal Graph Convolution Neural Network for Multi-object Tracking","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61876023,61902035,62001054"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012152","fundingName":"National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents","grantNumber":"BX20200067"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ST-Tracking: Spatial-temporal Graph Convolution Neural Network for Multi-object Tracking","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110154S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9564519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9564530,"authors":[{"name":"Bingquan Chen","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Bingquan","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Yi Zhou","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Yongbao Ma","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yongbao","lastName":"Ma"},{"name":"Hongqing Liu","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Hongqing","lastName":"Liu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2918-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2917-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2919-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564530","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564530","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Teleconferencing","Recurrent neural networks","Noise reduction","Signal processing algorithms","Oral communication","Speech enhancement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech enhancement","recurrent neural network (RNN)","the ideal amplitude mask","optimally modified log-spectral amplitude (OMLSA)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564530","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564394/9564402/09564530.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","startPage":"01","endPage":"05","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564402","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Real-Time Noise Suppression Algorithm for Far-Field Speech Communication Based on Recurrent Neural Network","abstract":"In teleconferencing scenarios, the speech is usually deteriorated by the background noises, thereby reducing the speech intelligibility and quality.

Recent literature has shown the effectiveness of machine learning models on travel time forecasting problems. However, most of these models predict travel time in a point estimation manner, which is not suitable for real scenarios. Instead of a determined value, the travel time within a future time period is a distribution. Besides, they all use grid structure data to obtain the spatial dependency, which does not reflect the traffic network's actual topology. Hence, we propose GCGTTE to estimate the travel time in a distribution form with Graph Deep Learning and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We convert the data into a graph structure and use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to build its spatial dependency. Furthermore, GCGTTE adopts GAN to approximate the real travel time distribution. We test the effectiveness of GCGTTE with other models on a real-world dataset. Thanks to the fine-grained spatial dependency modeling, GCGTTE outperforms the models that build models on a grid structure data significantly. Besides, we also compared the distribution approximation performance with DeepGTT, a Variational Inference-based model which had the state-of-the-art performance on travel time estimation. The result shows that GCGTTE outperforms DeepGTT on metrics and the distribution generated by GCGTTE is much closer to the original distribution.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564552","startPage":"1385","endPage":"1390","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564552.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learn Travel Time Distribution with Graph Deep Learning and Generative Adversarial Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Analytical models","Estimation","Predictive models","Generative adversarial networks","Feature extraction","Data models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Learn Travel Time Distribution with Graph Deep Learning and Generative Adversarial Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564552/","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learn Travel Time Distribution with Graph Deep Learning and Generative Adversarial Network","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0748.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0709S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9564552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9564555,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Gallitz","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt, Ingolstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Gallitz","id":"37087106178"},{"name":"Oliver De Candido","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"De Candido","id":"37085663627"},{"name":"Michael Botsch","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt, Ingolstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Botsch","id":"37529067700"},{"name":"Wolfgang Utschick","affiliation":["Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Utschick","id":"37273316200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564555","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":22},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Recurrent neural networks","Conferences","Machine learning","Task analysis","Intelligent transportation systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564555","abstract":"This paper proposes an interpretable machine learning structure for the early prediction of lane changes.

However, the high integration of EV fast-charging stations (EVFCS) into the power systems makes them more vulnerable to severe grid disturbances. In case of a disturbance driving the power system to instability, a fast prediction of stability status is vital for allowing sufficient time to take intelligent emergency control actions. Although various types of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been developed for early detection of instability, the lack of reliable ML/DL models, trained with a realistic dataset, limits their practical application. This paper presents a reliable, accurate DL-based model for early detection of instability in power systems, and compares the results with/without coupling of the EVFCSs. For training our ML/DL models, a large set of realistic phasor measurement unit (PMU) data is generated through a new approach involving a hybrid-type simulation, as an alternative to conventional approaches in data generation. In our experiments, time-synchronized measurements of voltage signals obtained from PMUs are taken as raw input data. Through our proposed method, raw PMU data are encoded into images for developing a reliable and robust convolutional neural network (CNN) model, predicting the stability status of power systems.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564623","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564623","startPage":"3198","endPage":"3203","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564623.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EV-Integrated Power System Transient Stability Prediction Based on Imaging Time Series and Deep Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"EV-Integrated Power System Transient Stability Prediction Based on Imaging Time Series and Deep Neural Network","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564623/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564623/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EV-Integrated Power System Transient Stability Prediction Based on Imaging Time Series and Deep Neural Network","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091418S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9564623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9564631,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Lu","affiliation":["Beijing Aerospace Automatic Control Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Lu"},{"name":"Jianming Zhou","affiliation":["Beijing Aerospace Automatic Control Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianming","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Hu Zhou","affiliation":["Beijing Aerospace Automatic Control Institute, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hu","lastName":"Zhou"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2918-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2917-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2919-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564631","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564631","abstract":"According to the characteristics of amplitude distribution of communication signals in fading channel, there is an optimal reference power in Automatic Gain Control (AGC) module, which has a maximum signal-to-noise ratio of the output signal for Analog to Digital Converter (ADC).

This new paradigm enables the network to leverage the \u201ccontext\u201d information of the geometry of objects and allows us to model the interactions among the features of multiple objects. Another central innovation of the proposed framework is the use of the Sinkhorn algorithm for end-to-end learning of the associations among objects during model training. The network is trained to predict object associations by taking into account constraints specific to the MOT task. To increase the detector's sensitivity, a new approach is also presented that propagates previous frame detections into each new frame using optical flow. These are treated as added object proposals which are then classified as objects. A new traffic monitoring dataset is additionally provided, which includes naturalistic video footage from current infrastructure cameras in Virginia Beach City.

However, traditional speech enhancement approaches, like minimum mean-square error (MMSE) and wiener filter (WF) have not been fully investigated. In order to the better characterize, we proposed a deep learning based MMSE approach for single-channel speech enhancement based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). The performance of MMSE approach can be improved by a priori signal-to-noise ratio. Therefore, we utilized an NMF-based Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet) as an estimator of the a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In test stage, multiple SNR level speech from colored noise sources and real-world non-stationary noise sources were used for evaluation. As expected, our present study outperformed many previous speech enhancement methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564668","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564402","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564394/9564402/09564668.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An NMF-based MMSE Approach for Single Channel Speech Enhancement Using Densely Connected Convolutional Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564668/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An NMF-based MMSE Approach for Single Channel Speech Enhancement Using Densely Connected Convolutional Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564668/","publicationDate":"17 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61831019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An NMF-based MMSE Approach for Single Channel Speech Enhancement Using Densely Connected Convolutional Network","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2356_Final_paper_submission.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064274S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564394","isNumber":"9564402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564394","xplore-issue":"9564402","articleId":"9564668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":9564669,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxu Lu","affiliation":["School of Navigation, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yuxu","lastName":"Lu","id":"37088465993"},{"name":"Yu Guo","affiliation":["School of Navigation, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Guo","id":"37088466449"},{"name":"Fenghua Zhu","affiliation":["Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Clouding Computing Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dongguan, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Fenghua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37655779400"},{"name":"Ryan Wen Liu","affiliation":["School of Navigation, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China","National Engineering Research Center for Water Transportation Safety, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ryan Wen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085765542"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564669","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuses","Neural networks","Imaging","Lighting","Feature extraction","Video surveillance","Robustness"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564669","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564669.pdf","startPage":"2869","endPage":"2874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Low-Visibility Enhancement in Maritime Video Surveillance: An Efficient and Effective Multi-Deep Neural Network","abstract":"Limited by insufficient illumination, the images collected by maritime imaging devices often suffer from low brightness, low contrast, low signal-to-noise ratio, severe information loss, and so on. The above problems restrict the development of maritime- related work such as intelligent supervision, collision warning, accident investigation, etc. To improve the imaging quality of maritime video images, we propose an efficient and effective multi-deep neural network (termed EEMNN) for low-visibility enhancement. In particular, we fuse the multi-scale information extracted from the encoder-decoder module using the dense blocks (DBs) and attention blocks (ABs). It is capable of enhancing the fused information leading to preserving the edges, textures, and other fine details. To prevent the overexposure of enhanced images, we fuse and reconstruct the output features of DBs and ABs with the raw low-light image to get the final enhanced image through two residual blocks (RBs). The mixing of multiple network modules can effectively improve the generalization ability and robustness of our network. Through extensive experiments, EEMNN has higher objective evaluation indicators, more efficient enhancement, more natural maritime scenes, and stronger detail-preservation capabilities compared with other enhancement methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564669/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Towards Low-Visibility Enhancement in Maritime Video Surveillance: An Efficient and Effective Multi-Deep Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Low-Visibility Enhancement in Maritime Video Surveillance: An Efficient and Effective Multi-Deep Neural Network","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062725S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9564669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9564674,"authors":[{"name":"Seungwon Choi","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Seungwon","lastName":"Choi","id":"37292420300"},{"name":"Nahyun Kweon","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Nahyun","lastName":"Kweon","id":"37089006387"},{"name":"Chanuk Yang","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Chanuk","lastName":"Yang","id":"37089004272"},{"name":"Dongchan Kim","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Dongchan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086104538"},{"name":"Hyukju Shon","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hyukju","lastName":"Shon","id":"37089006830"},{"name":"Jaewoong Choi","affiliation":["Hyundai Motor Company, Hwaseong-si, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jaewoong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37089003547"},{"name":"Kunsoo Huh","affiliation":["Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Kunsoo","lastName":"Huh","id":"37333889500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564674","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564674","abstract":"One of the main issues that potentially cause faults in ego-vehicle trajectory prediction is various styles of drivers.

This system can be adopted in many vehicles because it only needs CAN-bus data to predict the trajectory. The proposed architecture involves two stages, Driving style recognition and Trajectory prediction. In the Driving style recognition, Recurrence Plot (RP) transforms sequential data into images and the converted images are processed into the driving styles by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In the Trajectory prediction part, Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) generates the multi-modal realistic trajectories from the distribution and these trajectories are conditioned by the driving style. In this paper, we predict more realistic and accurate trajectories than conventional prediction methods, even if a driver's driving style is not categorized by our defined classes.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564674","startPage":"1515","endPage":"1520","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564674.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSA-GAN: Driving Style Attention Generative Adversarial Network for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image recognition","Transforms","Prediction methods","Generative adversarial networks","Trajectory","Convolutional neural networks","History"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"DSA-GAN: Driving Style Attention Generative Adversarial Network for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564674/","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSA-GAN: Driving Style Attention Generative Adversarial Network for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112239S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9564674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9564677,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Li Wang","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sheng-Li","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089005714"},{"name":"Sing-Yao Wu","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Sing-Yao","lastName":"Wu","id":"37089007077"},{"name":"Ching-Chu Lin","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Chu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37089005687"},{"name":"Srivalli Boddupalli","affiliation":["University of Florida, Gainesville, FL"],"firstName":"Srivalli","lastName":"Boddupalli","id":"37087078480"},{"name":"Po-Jui Chang","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Jui","lastName":"Chang","id":"37089002543"},{"name":"Chung-Wei Lin","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Wei","lastName":"Lin","id":"37062110200"},{"name":"Chi-Sheng Shih","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Sheng","lastName":"Shih","id":"37276078500"},{"name":"Sandip Ray","affiliation":["University of Florida, Gainesville, FL"],"firstName":"Sandip","lastName":"Ray","id":"37306587700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564677","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Adaptive systems","Design methodology","Intrusion detection","Predictive models"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564677","abstract":"Autonomous vehicle-following systems, including Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), improve safety, efficiency, and string stability for a vehicle (the ego vehicle) following its leading vehicle.

However, it has been shown that sensors and wireless channels are vulnerable to security attacks, and attackers can modify data sensed from sensors or received from other vehicles. To address this problem, in this paper, we design three types of stealthy attacks on ACC or CACC inputs, where the stealthy attacks can deceive a rule-based detection approach and impede system properties (collision-freeness and vehicle-following distance). We then develop two deep-learning models, a predictor-based model and an encoder-decoder- based model to detect the attacks, where the two models do not need attacker models for training. The experimental results demonstrate the respective strengths of different models and lead to a methodology for the design of learning-based intrusion detection approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564677","startPage":"865","endPage":"872","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564677.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep-Learning-Based Intrusion Detection for Autonomous Vehicle-Following Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep-Learning-Based Intrusion Detection for Autonomous Vehicle-Following Systems","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564677/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564677/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep-Learning-Based Intrusion Detection for Autonomous Vehicle-Following Systems","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0827.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083616S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9564677","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9564688,"authors":[{"name":"Dhruvkumar Patel","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas"],"firstName":"Dhruvkumar","lastName":"Patel","id":"37088661296"},{"name":"Rym Zalila-Wenkstern","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas"],"firstName":"Rym","lastName":"Zalila-Wenkstern","id":"38299995400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564688","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564688","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Heuristic algorithms","Reinforcement learning","Traffic control","Search problems","Planning","Reliability"]}],"abstract":"Cooperative action planning for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in an emergency scenario is an important task in the autonomous driving domain. Reinforcement learning algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) have popularly been used to solve this problem with some success. MCTS rely on performing many simulations of CAV actions to learn expected reward values for CAV actions. A refined reward function design is a necessary precondition for better success rates in MCTS. Traditionally, predefined reward functions with fixed reward parameters are used in all CAVs scenarios by most MCTS-based algorithms. This paper presents a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based algorithm that dynamically modifies the reward function parameters to encourage or discourage particular CAV actions. Our proposed algorithm with a dynamic reward function significantly improves the reliability of MCTS having a fixed reward function. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a large-scale multi-agent-based traffic simulation system. Experimental results show that our algorithm significantly improves upon current state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized algorithms.","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564688.pdf","startPage":"1105","endPage":"1111","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564688","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564688","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Reward for CAV Action Planning using Monte Carlo Tree Search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Reward for CAV Action Planning using Monte Carlo Tree Search","htmlLink":"/document/9564688/","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Reward for CAV Action Planning using Monte Carlo Tree Search","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053309S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9564688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9564699,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Hou","affiliation":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Hou","id":"37085358392"},{"name":"Xiangyu Zhang","affiliation":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085992790"},{"name":"Peter Graf","affiliation":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Graf","id":"37574213100"},{"name":"Charles Tripp","affiliation":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Tripp","id":"37086747872"},{"name":"David Biagioni","affiliation":["National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Biagioni","id":"38234421100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564699","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Meters","Scalability","Roads","Merging","Reinforcement learning","Traffic control","Tools"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564699","abstract":"Freeway bottlenecks such as on-ramp merging areas account for about 40% of recurring freeway congestion. It is generally agreed that building more roads and adding more lanes to existing infrastructure does not solve the congestion problem, and so dynamic traffic control measures offer a more cost-effective alternative. Ramp meters, traffic signal devices that regulate traffic flow entering freeways, are among the most effective measures to mitigate congestion at on-ramp merging areas on freeways. The confluence of deep reinforcement learning (RL) and connectivity provides a possible solution to advance ramp meter signal control. Deep RL is a group of machine-learning methods that enables an agent learning from the environment to improve its performance. In this study, three deep RL methods-proximal policy optimization (PPO), Ape-X deep Q-network (DQN), and asynchronous advantage actor-critic agents (A3C)-are explored for ramp meter signal control to maximize vehicle speed and traffic throughput, as well as to minimize energy consumption and emissions at freeway on-ramp merging areas in a connected environment. The low computational requirement and scalability of deep RL for deployment make it a powerful optimization tool for time-sensitive applications such as ramp meter signal control. The results of this study show that deep RL methods yield superior performance to both a fixed-time controller and ALINE A, a state-of-the-art feedback controller.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564699","startPage":"3813","endPage":"3820","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564699.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cyber-Physical System for Freeway Ramp Meter Signal Control Using Deep Reinforcement Learning in a Connected Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Cyber-Physical System for Freeway Ramp Meter Signal Control Using Deep Reinforcement Learning in a Connected Environment","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564699/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564699/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cyber-Physical System for Freeway Ramp Meter Signal Control Using Deep Reinforcement Learning in a Connected Environment","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08602S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9564699","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9564706,"authors":[{"name":"Ruijie Zhu","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi"],"firstName":"Ruijie","lastName":"Zhu"},{"name":"Caini Fan","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi"],"firstName":"Caini","lastName":"Fan"},{"name":"Zidie Chen","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi"],"firstName":"Zidie","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Rugui Yao","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi"],"firstName":"Rugui","lastName":"Yao"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2918-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2917-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2919-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564706","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564706","abstract":"In some real application scenarios, it is difficult to obtain enough labeled data and get an ideal classification result.

Our method is applied in the detection on Asian giant hornet and attains favorable results across few-shot datasets.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564706","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564394/9564402/09564706.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-invasion: A prediction model based on multi-objective optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Adaptation models","Biological system modeling","Sociology","Predictive models","Pareto optimization","Natural language processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["prediction","Gaussian Mixture Model","Pareto frontier","convolutional neural network","few-shot dataset"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Bio-invasion: A prediction model based on multi-objective optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564706/","publicationDate":"17 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-invasion: A prediction model based on multi-objective optimization","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2472_Final_paper_submission.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070291S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564394","isNumber":"9564402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564394","xplore-issue":"9564402","articleId":"9564706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":9564709,"authors":[{"name":"Ce Zhang","affiliation":["Blacksburg, VA, USA","Virginia Tech Autonomous Systems and Intelligent Machines (ASIM) Lab."],"firstName":"Ce","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088475416"},{"name":"Azim Eskandarian","affiliation":["Virginia Tech Autonomous Systems and Intelligent Machines (ASIM) Lab.","Virginia Tech, Director of ASIM Lab, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Azim","lastName":"Eskandarian","id":"37267386900"},{"name":"Xuelai Du","affiliation":["Blacksburg, VA, USA","Virginia Tech ASIM Lab."],"firstName":"Xuelai","lastName":"Du","id":"37089005009"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564709","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Heuristic algorithms","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Prediction algorithms","Complexity theory","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autonomous Vehicles","Environment Perception","Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564709","abstract":"Environment perception is crucial for autonomous vehicle (AV) safety. Most existing AV perception algorithms have not studied the surrounding environment complexity and failed to include the environment complexity parameter. This paper proposes a novel attention-based neural network model to predict the complexity level of the surrounding driving environment. The proposed model takes naturalistic driving videos and corresponding vehicle dynamics parameters as input. It consists of a Yolo-v3 object detection algorithm, a heat map generation algorithm, CNN-based feature extractors, and attention-based feature extractors for both video and time-series vehicle dynamics data inputs to extract features. The output from the proposed algorithm is a surrounding environment complexity parameter. The Berkeley DeepDrive dataset (BDD Dataset) and subjectively labeled surrounding environment complexity levels are used for model training and validation to evaluate the algorithm. The proposed attention-based network achieves 91.22% average classification accuracy to classify the surrounding environment complexity. It proves that the environment complexity level can be accurately predicted and applied for future AVs' environment perception studies.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564709","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564709.pdf","startPage":"2781","endPage":"2787","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attention-based Neural Network for Driving Environment Complexity Perception","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564709/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Attention-based Neural Network for Driving Environment Complexity Perception","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564709/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attention-based Neural Network for Driving Environment Complexity Perception","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054484S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9564709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":9564720,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunki Seong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunki","lastName":"Seong","id":"37088596829"},{"name":"Chanyoung Jung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chanyoung","lastName":"Jung","id":"37086555962"},{"name":"Seungwook Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seungwook","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086196974"},{"name":"David Hyunchul Shim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"David Hyunchul","lastName":"Shim","id":"37281960000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564720","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"abstract":"Driving at an unsignalized intersection is a complex traffic scenario that requires both traffic safety and efficiency. At the unsignalized intersection, the driving policy does not simply maintain a safe distance for all vehicles. Instead, it pays more attention to vehicles that potentially have conflicts with the ego vehicle, while guessing the intentions of other vehicles. In this paper, we propose an attention-based driving policy for handling unprotected intersections using deep reinforcement learning. By leveraging attention, our policy learns to focus on more spatially and temporally important features within its egocentric observation. This selective attention enables our policy to make safe and efficient driving decisions in various congested intersection environments. Our experiments show that the proposed policy not only outperforms other baseline policies in various intersection scenarios and traffic density conditions but also has interpretability in its decision process. Furthermore, we verify our policy model's feasibility in real-world deployment by transferring the trained model to a full-scale vehicle system. Our model successfully performs various intersection scenarios, even with noisy sensory data and delayed responses. Our approach reveals more opportunities for implementing generic and interpretable policy models in realworld autonomous driving.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Reinforcement learning","Robustness","Data models","Safety","Noise measurement","Intelligent transportation systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver information systems","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile robots","road safety","road traffic","road vehicles","traffic control","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsignalized intersection","attention-based deep reinforcement learning","complex traffic scenario","traffic safety","driving policy","ego vehicle","unprotected intersections","leveraging attention","spatially features","temporally important features","selective attention","safe driving decisions","efficient driving decisions","congested intersection environments","baseline policies","intersection scenarios","traffic density conditions","policy model","full-scale vehicle system","generic policy models","interpretable policy models","realworld autonomous driving"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564720","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564720.pdf","startPage":"559","endPage":"566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to Drive at Unsignalized Intersections using Attention-based Deep Reinforcement Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Drive at Unsignalized Intersections using Attention-based Deep Reinforcement Learning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564720/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564720/","accessionNumber":"21259479","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Drive at Unsignalized Intersections using Attention-based Deep Reinforcement Learning","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081693S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9564720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9564730,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Griebel","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement, Control and Microtechnology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Griebel","id":"37087101562"},{"name":"Dominik Authaler","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement, Control and Microtechnology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Authaler","id":"37089003205"},{"name":"Markus Horn","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement, Control and Microtechnology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Horn","id":"37086525131"},{"name":"Matti Henning","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement, Control and Microtechnology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Henning","id":"37089005147"},{"name":"Michael Buchholz","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement, Control and Microtechnology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Buchholz","id":"38180084100"},{"name":"Klaus Dietmayer","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement, Control and Microtechnology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Dietmayer","id":"37283417900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564730","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar measurements","Radar clutter","Radar detection","Radar","Object detection","Robustness","Velocity measurement"]}],"abstract":"For autonomous driving, radar is an important sensor type. On the one hand, radar offers a direct measurement of the radial velocity of targets in the environment. On the other hand, in literature, radar sensors are known for their robustness against several kinds of adverse weather conditions. However, on the downside, radar is susceptible to ghost targets or clutter which can be caused by several different causes, e.g., reflective surfaces in the environment. Ghost targets, for instance, can result in erroneous object detections. To this end, it is desirable to identify anomalous targets as early as possible in radar data. In this work, we present an approach based on PointNets to detect anomalous radar targets. Modifying the PointNet-architecture driven by our task, we developed a novel grouping variant which contributes to a multi-form grouping module. Our method is evaluated on a real-world dataset in urban scenarios and shows promising results for the detection of anomalous radar targets.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564730","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564730.pdf","startPage":"2667","endPage":"2673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Radar Data Using PointNets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564730/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Radar Data Using PointNets","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564730/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection in Radar Data Using PointNets","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054633S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9564730","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9564736,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Yao","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Millimeter Wave and Terahertz Technology Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Yao"},{"name":"Shiyong Li","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Millimeter Wave and Terahertz Technology Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shiyong","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Houjun Sun","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Millimeter Wave and Terahertz Technology Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Houjun","lastName":"Sun"},{"name":"Qiang An","affiliation":["Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"An"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2918-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2917-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2919-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564736","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":23},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image quality","Inverse problems","Neural networks","Signal processing algorithms","Focusing","Radar imaging","Radar scattering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["inverse scattering","back-projection","cascaded network","fully connected network","UNet"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564736","abstract":"Traditional nonlinear solutions for inverse scattering problem have the drawback of high computational complexity. Its approximated alternative, back-projection (BP) algorithm, can achieve a good trade-off between imaging quality and complexity. However, in the case of limited frequency samples, BP suffers from the image quality degeneration. In order to achieve high-resolution imaging, this work turns to deep learning (DL) based approach and proposes an end-to-end cascaded neural network structure, namely a convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by a UNet network. Firstly, the equivalence between the fully connected network and the BP algorithm is derived. Secondly, to increase the learning ability of the network and avoid overfitting, a CNN is used to replace the fully connected network. By directly focusing the raw scattered radar echoes using the network, a coarse radar imagery of the region under investigation can be obtained. Then, a UN et network is further cascaded to suppress the clutter and improve the image quality of the coarse focused radar imagery. Finally, EM simulations using the MINST dataset are conducted to train the proposed network. The results show that the reconstruction using the trained cascaded network outperforms the BP algorithm under the condition that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm and the BP algorithm is close. A better focusing performance is achieved as expected.","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564736","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9564736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564402","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564394/9564402/09564736.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverse Scattering via Cascaded Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564736/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Inverse Scattering via Cascaded Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564736/","publicationDate":"17 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse Scattering via Cascaded Neural Network","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2357_Final_paper_submission.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073053S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564394","isNumber":"9564402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564394","xplore-issue":"9564402","articleId":"9564736","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":9564750,"authors":[{"name":"Jakob Valtl","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies AG, Germany"],"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Valtl","id":"37088888737"},{"name":"Vadim Issakov","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig, Germany"],"firstName":"Vadim","lastName":"Issakov","id":"37543259200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564750","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Knowledge engineering","Time-frequency analysis","Frequency modulation","Navigation","Radar","Radar tracking","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radar applications","artificial neural networks","edge computing","real-time systems","autonomous vehicles","object recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564750","abstract":"Autonomous driving is a highly complex task, which involves the use of numerous sensors and various algorithms.

In recent year, tremendous sensors are deployed in order to collect big data, and equipment maintenance costs a lot. With the development of deep learning, especially especially Generative Adversarial Networks, we can generate realistic big artificial traffic flow data and use small real traffic data and synthesized traffic data in traffic data mining tasks. In this paper, we focus on discovering the semantics embedded in latent codes which are fed into Generative Adversarial Networks, and propose to use the interpolation of semantic latent code to generate semantic manipulation of traffic flow. We evaluate our approach using the publicly available data from Caltrans Performance Measurements Systems (PeMS), and experimental results show the the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564752","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564752.pdf","startPage":"1451","endPage":"1456","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic Flow Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks via Semantic Latent Codes Manipulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Traffic Flow Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks via Semantic Latent Codes Manipulation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564752/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61903363"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic Flow Synthesis Using Generative Adversarial Networks via Semantic Latent Codes Manipulation","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"1004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106117S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9564752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":9564758,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwei Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jianwei","lastName":"Sun"},{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Qingzhan Shi","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Qingzhan","lastName":"Shi"},{"name":"Yifan Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yifan","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Zekun Yao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zekun","lastName":"Yao"},{"name":"Naichang Yuan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environment Effects on Electronics and Information System National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Naichang","lastName":"Yuan"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2918-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2917-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2919-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564758","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":18},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564758","abstract":"Genetic algorithm is a feasible method to realize waveform intelligent optimization.

The current research attempts to improve the performance of speech enhancement by microphone array, where the minimum variance and distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer shows a good performance and has been widely studied and applied. In this paper, the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to estimate the time-frequency (T-F) masking of target speech and noise, which is intended to obtain covariance matrix in the MVDR. On the other hand, the steering vector is estimated through main feature pattern of covariance matrix, instead of estimating the direction of arrival angle or time difference of arrival. In the network training, the training goal is to minimize the mean square error (MSE) between the enhanced speech and real speech, and the loss function is constructed with the MSE. Finally, a microphone array speech simulator is used to generate multi-channel speech and the related simulation experiment is carried out. The experimental results show that the CNN -based MVDR Beamforming method really improved the performance of general MVDR-based beamformer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"17 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564817/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"An Implementaion of the CNN-Based MVDR Beamforming For Speech Enhancement","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61831019"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Implementaion of the CNN-Based MVDR Beamforming For Speech Enhancement","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2507_Final_paper_submission.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058327S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564394","isNumber":"9564402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564394","xplore-issue":"9564402","articleId":"9564817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9564852,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["Research and Development Institute, Northwestern Polytechnical University in Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China","School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Poly technical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Qunfei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Poly technical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qunfei","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Chengbing He","affiliation":["Research and Development Institute, Northwestern Polytechnical University in Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China","School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Poly technical University, Xi'an, China","Shaanxi Key laboratory of Underwater Information Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Chengbing","lastName":"He"},{"name":"Meiling Ma","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Poly technical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Meiling","lastName":"Ma"},{"name":"Yingjie Wang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Poly technical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yingjie","lastName":"Wang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2918-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2917-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2919-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564852","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":49},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Belief Propagation detector for OTFS System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564852","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Time-frequency analysis","Bit error rate","Signal processing algorithms","Modulation","Detectors","Time-varying channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OTFS","Belief propagation","Delay-Doppler channels"]}],"abstract":"The orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a potential candidate modulation scheme for high mobility wireless communications.

Challenges include different crowd densities, occlusions, lack of available data and so on. Emergence of deep learning and computer vision methods has shown potentials to deal with this problem. Most of the recent works focus on detecting combined pedestrian flow or counting the total number of pedestrians. In this work, we propose to detect not only combined pedestrian flow but also pedestrian flows from different directions on a crosswalk at a traffic intersection. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: 1) we introduce a synthetic dataset that we create using computer game and a real-world dataset we collect from the street; 2) we propose a Pedestrian Counting Network (PCNet) to count pedestrians from different directions along a crosswalk and then propose a Pedestrian Flow Inference Model (PFIM) to infer the pedestrian flow parameters of volume and density; 3) we design a structure-aware domain adaptation for learning from synthetic data to real data.

A novel multiscale dual-attention (MDA) based convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed in this paper to highlight the deep distinguishable features extracted from SAR images for classification. First, we apply the data enhancement method to expand the limited labeled sample set to alleviate the defect of unbalanced dataset. Second, the squeeze-and-excitation(SE) block is adopted to learn the initial weight of the feature maps to mitigate the negative effects of large similarity between different ship classes. Third, the weighted feature maps are sent into two parallel self-attention blocks, and the semantic dependence on spatial dimension and channel dimension is modeled respectively. Feature fusion is carried out to further improve feature discrimination ability. The results of ablation experiments and comparative experiments on the open SAR ship dataset show that this method can mine deep discriminant features effectively, and further improve the classification accuracy of ships in SAR images compared with baseline method and other latest methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564861/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564861/","publicationDate":"17 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Multiscale Dual-Attention based Convolutional Neural Network for Ship Classification in SAR Image","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801211,61871218"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University, China","grantNumber":"3082019NC2019002,NG2020001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002852","fundingName":"Open Research Fund of State Key Laboratory of Space-Ground Integrated Information Technology","grantNumber":"2018_SGIIT_KFJJ_AI_03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010011","fundingName":"Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"KYCX21_0216"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiscale Dual-Attention based Convolutional Neural Network for Ship Classification in SAR Image","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2492_Final_paper_submission.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063033S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564394","isNumber":"9564402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564394","xplore-issue":"9564402","articleId":"9564861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":9564916,"authors":[{"name":"Sampo Kuutti","affiliation":["Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Lab, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Sampo","lastName":"Kuutti","id":"37086361141"},{"name":"Saber Fallah","affiliation":["Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Lab, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Saber","lastName":"Fallah","id":"38667400500"},{"name":"Richard Bowden","affiliation":["Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Bowden","id":"37268872100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564916","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564916","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Robust control","Roads","Conferences","Safety","Standards","Autonomous vehicles"]}],"abstract":"Imitation learning has been widely used to learn control policies for autonomous driving based on pre-recorded data. However, imitation learning based policies have been shown to be susceptible to compounding errors when encountering states outside of the training distribution. Further, these agents have been demonstrated to be easily exploitable by adversarial road users aiming to create collisions. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce Adversarial Mixture Density Networks (AMDN), which learns two distributions from separate datasets. The first is a distribution of safe actions learned from a dataset of naturalistic human driving. The second is a distribution representing unsafe actions likely to lead to collision, learned from a dataset of collisions. During training, we leverage these two distributions to provide an additional loss based on the similarity of the two distributions. By penalising the safe action distribution based on its similarity to the unsafe action distribution when training on the collision dataset, a more robust and safe control policy is obtained. We demonstrate the proposed AMDN approach in a vehicle following use-case, and evaluate under naturalistic and adversarial testing environments. We show that despite its simplicity, AMDN provides significant benefits for the safety of the learned control policy, when compared to pure imitation learning or standard mixture density network approaches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564916","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564916.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"711","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adversarial Mixture Density Networks: Learning to Drive Safely from Collision Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Adversarial Mixture Density Networks: Learning to Drive Safely from Collision Data","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9564916/","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564916/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adversarial Mixture Density Networks: Learning to Drive Safely from Collision Data","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083945S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9564916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9564919,"authors":[{"name":"Ruth David","affiliation":["Chair of Dynamics and Control, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Ruth","lastName":"David","id":"37089003851"},{"name":"Sandra Rothe","affiliation":["Chair of Dynamics and Control, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Sandra","lastName":"Rothe","id":"37085683489"},{"name":"Dirk Soffker","affiliation":["Chair of Dynamics and Control, University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Soffker","id":"37424607300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564919","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564919","abstract":"Developing driving behavior prediction and recognition models play a crucial role in Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS). Developing these models generally requires the use of Machine Learning approaches. Often, Machine Learning approaches are difficult to interpret. In this contribution, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based state machine driving behavior recognition model is developed to estimate three lane changing behaviors. A state machine topology defining the relationship between the states (driving behaviors) is developed. The state transitions to another state or remains in the same state based on specific conditions defined by estimations of ANN. Two options are developed: using one common ANN or using three ANN (for three states). Design parameters (weights and biases) defined using optimization describe the ANN estimations when trained. Based on this, lane changing behaviors for the models are estimated. Data from three participants were collected. The results show that this approach performs better than the conventional ANN in terms of DR and FAR with improvements up to 46 % for DR and 34 % for FAR. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the approach introduced realizes high accuracy (ACC), high detection rates (DR), and low false alarm rates (FAR).","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564919","startPage":"3444","endPage":"3449","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564919.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lane changing behavior recognition based on Artificial Neural Network-based State Machine approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network topology","Conferences","Estimation","Artificial neural networks","Machine learning","Gaze tracking","Predictive models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9564919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Lane changing behavior recognition based on Artificial Neural Network-based State Machine approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9564919/","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lane changing behavior recognition based on Artificial Neural Network-based State Machine approach","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053649S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9564919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":9564929,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Mo","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Mo","id":"37088557661"},{"name":"Yang Xing","affiliation":["University of Oxford, UK"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Xing","id":"37086297251"},{"name":"Chen Lv","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Lv","id":"37086095836"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9564929","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9564929","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Road transportation","Recurrent neural networks","Decision making","Predictive models","Feature extraction","Trajectory","Safety"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564929","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09564929.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","startPage":"1934","endPage":"1939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9564929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph and Recurrent Neural Network-based Vehicle Trajectory Prediction For Highway Driving","abstract":"Integrating trajectory prediction to the decision-making and planning modules of modular autonomous driving systems is expected to improve the safety and efficiency of self-driving vehicles.

This work proposes a GNN-RNN based Encoder-Decoder network for interaction-aware trajectory prediction, where vehicles' dynamics features are extracted from their historical tracks using RNN, and the inter-vehicular interaction is represented by a directed graph and encoded using a GNN. The parallelism of GNN implies the proposed method's potential to predict multi-vehicular trajectories simultaneously.

If this attack hits UAV s, it could result in damage to property and the release of private data or classified documents.

Graph convolutional network is applied to extract spatial feature of passenger flow in the metro network. Gated recurrent unit is introduced to extract temporal feature of passenger flow.

Our proposed approach uses modified version of CSPDarkent-53 as the backbone, consequently achieve faster and more accurate detection outcomes. We use six types of datasets of different images of the rail surface for investigation of the defects and compare the outcomes with a different network. This technique is used to evaluate our proposed method's efficiency to detect and classify the defects by comparing them with other techniques. Moreover, the experimental outcomes depict the promising capability of our proposed method. The results represent that accuracy of this algorithm can reach up to 96.5% on the mAP metric.

Due to the complexity of urban streets, environmental conditions, and the behavior of other actors, AVs encounter out-of-distribution events at a non-trivial rate (often termed the long-tail problem). Anomalous situations may be statically perceivable (e.g. an overturned truck, or a mounted policeman) or require nuanced behavioral inference (e.g. vehicles swerving to avoid broken glass on the roadway). Despite the importance of robustly identifying these situations, there are few resources for developing or benchmarking new methods in the research community. Here we introduce a framework for generating anomalous and nominal scenarios using a domain-specific scenario description language (Scenic) and a driving simulation environment (CARLA) from multiple viewpoints. We introduce four classes of roadway anomalies and establish a benchmark and baselines for the development of new methods. Crucially, our benchmark supports the development of both sensor-based and semantic approaches.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\nThe code and related documentation for this work is available at https://github.com/t27/carla-scenic-data-collector","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9565042","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09565042.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9565042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","startPage":"2074","endPage":"2081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simulation-Based Benchmark for Behavioral Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Simulation-Based Benchmark for Behavioral Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Vehicles","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565042/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9565042/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simulation-Based Benchmark for Behavioral Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Vehicles","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081653S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9565042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9565070,"authors":[{"name":"Shaochen Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaochen","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Lijun Xu","affiliation":["School of Informatica and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lijun","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Shefeng Yan","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shefeng","lastName":"Yan"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2918-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2917-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2919-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9565070","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"abstract":"Channel estimation is the key to underwater acoustic OFDM systems. Considering the sparsity of the underwater acoustic channel, compressed sensing is used for channel estimation. However, many existing algorithms are either too complicated or cannot guarantee the accuracy of reconstruction. Therefore, a fast twice orthogonal matching pursuit (TOMP) channel estimation algorithm is proposed. The orthogonality of some measurement atoms is exploited to eliminate the iteration steps in the first OMP, and the number of measurement atoms is reduced according to the relationship between the different over-sampling factors of the measurement matrix in the second OMP. Compared with the conventional OMP algorithm, TOMP can reduce by about 2/3 computational complexity, and maintain accuracy in the sparse underwater acoustic channel estimation. Both the simulation and the sea experiment in the south China sea results show the feasibility of proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564394/9564402/09565070.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Signal Processing, Communications and Computing (ICSPCC)","doi":"10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9565070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPCC52875.2021.9565070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low complexity OMP sparse channel estimation algorithm in OFDM system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atomic measurements","OFDM","Computational modeling","Matching pursuit algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Channel estimation","Sea measurements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sparse channel estimation","OFDM","compressive sensing","OMP algorithm","low complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565070/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A low complexity OMP sparse channel estimation algorithm in OFDM system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9565070/","publicationDate":"17 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61725106,61901467"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low complexity OMP sparse channel estimation algorithm in OFDM system","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"2509_Final_paper_submission.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046876S","chronDate":"17-19 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564394","isNumber":"9564402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564394","xplore-issue":"9564402","articleId":"9565070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9565074,"authors":[{"name":"Yuhui Hong","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yuhui","lastName":"Hong","id":"37089002659"},{"name":"Yaochen Li","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yaochen","lastName":"Li","id":"37715813500"},{"name":"Chao Zhu","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086962517"},{"name":"Ying Zhang","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37088983436"},{"name":"Yuehu Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yuehu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279418600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9565074","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565074","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Convolution","Neural networks","Object segmentation","Streaming media","Feature extraction","Real-time systems"]}],"abstract":"Video object segmentation (VOS) is an essential part of intelligent transportation systems (ITS).

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised real-time video object segmentation method based on a Siamese network with a novel polar representation method. This polar representation method could reduce the parameters for encoding masks, so that the inference speed is enhanced significantly. Besides, an asymmetric Siamese network is designed to extract the features from different spatial scales. To reduce the antagonism among the branches of the head part, we propose the idea of peeling convolution. Based on this idea, repeated cross-correlation and semi-FPN are designed as the neck part of the neural network.

Failure of railway turnout shall endanger train operations and affect their efficiency. Currently, the fault diagnosis of railway turnout still relies on the experience of maintenance personnel that can introduce several problems, such as low fault diagnosis efficiency and large amounts of required labor. To solve these problems, this paper takes the most widely used ZD6 turnout system in China as the research object, the railway turnout failure modes are summarized into eight typical types. Combined with the actual railway turnout fault data, the wavelet transform is used for the railway turnout action current extracted feature vector. The theory of fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) was designed to diagnose the fault modes of the railway turnout based on extracted feature vector, and the genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization (GAPSO) was selected to learn the weights of FCM. The simulation results indicated that FCM classifier model, based on GAPSO, could effectively classify the faults of the railway turnout. The GAPSO-FCM model could achieve a 97.1% fault diagnosis accuracy rate that showed that the GAPSO-FCM model proposed in this paper had high accuracy. Finally, we discuss further improvements that should be made to the model in the future.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09565075.pdf","startPage":"2187","endPage":"2192","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9565075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9565075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Diagnosis of ZD6 Turnout System Based on Wavelet Transform and GAPSO-FCM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Wavelet transforms","Simulation","Maintenance engineering","Feature extraction","Rail transportation","Safety"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ZD6 turnout system","fuzzy cognitive map","fault diagnosis","wavelet transform","particle swarm optimization","genetic algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Fault Diagnosis of ZD6 Turnout System Based on Wavelet Transform and GAPSO-FCM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9565075/","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"W18A200060"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Diagnosis of ZD6 Turnout System Based on Wavelet Transform and GAPSO-FCM","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061777S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9565075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9565077,"authors":[{"name":"Fahimeh Farahnakian","affiliation":["University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Fahimeh","lastName":"Farahnakian","id":"37662210400"},{"name":"Luca Zelioli","affiliation":["University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Zelioli","id":"37088482623"},{"name":"Jukka Heikkonen","affiliation":["University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Jukka","lastName":"Heikkonen","id":"37085438371"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9565077","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Transfer learning","Detectors","Object detection","Feature extraction","Sensor systems","Safety"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565077","abstract":"Reliable vessel detection can improve safety and security in maritime environment. Recently, application of Deep Learning (DL)-based detectors have become popular in autonomous vehicles. The aim of this paper is to study how much a pretrained DL model on a domain-specific marine data can improve the performance of the detectors for vessel detection? To this end, we trained state-of-the-art DL-based detectors (Faster R-CNN [1], R-FCN [2] and SSD [3]) using an open source generic object detection COCO dataset [4] and a marine SeaShips dataset [5]. The performance of these detectors are explored based on different feature extractors. Moreover, we investigate the effect of object size on the detection accuracy. To obtain results, we collected a real marine dataset by a sensor system onboard a vessel in the Finnish archipelago. This system is used for developing autonomous vessels, and records data in a range of operation and climatic conditions. The experimental results show that Faster R-CNN with ResNet101 achieves the highest object detection accuracy with mean average precision of 75.2%.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9565077","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09565077.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9565077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transfer Learning for Maritime Vessel Detection using Deep Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Transfer Learning for Maritime Vessel Detection using Deep Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9565077/","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transfer Learning for Maritime Vessel Detection using Deep Neural Networks","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.247658S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9565077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":9565086,"authors":[{"name":"Michal U\u0159i\u010d\u00e1\u0159","affiliation":["Independent Researcher, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Michal","lastName":"U\u0159i\u010d\u00e1\u0159","id":"37085676207"},{"name":"Ganesh Sistu","affiliation":["Valeo Vision Systems, Ireland"],"firstName":"Ganesh","lastName":"Sistu","id":"37087107513"},{"name":"Lucie Yahiaoui","affiliation":["Valeo Vision Systems, Ireland"],"firstName":"Lucie","lastName":"Yahiaoui","id":"37089003136"},{"name":"Senthil Yogamani","affiliation":["Valeo Vision Systems, Ireland"],"firstName":"Senthil","lastName":"Yogamani","id":"37086351846"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9142-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9141-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9143-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9565086","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Costs","Annotations","Semantics","Manuals","Semisupervised learning","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ensemble-based semisupervised","noisy soiling annotations","autonomous driving","surround view cameras","challenging task","expensive task","unclear boundary","soiling categories","water drops","mud particles","annotation quality","poorly annotated data","noisy annotations","pseudolabel driven ensemble model","problematic annotations","soiling segmentation model","noisy labels","refined labels","refined annotations","lower cost coarse annotations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565086","abstract":"Manual annotation of soiling on surround view cameras is a very challenging and expensive task. The unclear boundary for various soiling categories like water drops or mud particles usually results in a large variance in the annotation quality. As a result, the models trained on such poorly annotated data are far from being optimal. In this paper, we focus on handling such noisy annotations via pseudo-label driven ensemble model which allow us to quickly spot problematic annotations and in most cases also sufficiently fixing them. We train a soiling segmentation model on both noisy and refined labels and demonstrate significant improvements using the refined annotations. It also illustrates that it is possible to effectively refine lower cost coarse annotations.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9565086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC48978.2021.9565086","startPage":"2925","endPage":"2930","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9564393/9564395/09565086.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9564395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ensemble-Based Semi-Supervised Learning to Improve Noisy Soiling Annotations in Autonomous Driving","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Ensemble-Based Semi-Supervised Learning to Improve Noisy Soiling Annotations in Autonomous Driving","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","publicationDate":"19 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9565086/","accessionNumber":"21259401","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565086/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ensemble-Based Semi-Supervised Learning to Improve Noisy Soiling Annotations in Autonomous Driving","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"0559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09277S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9564393","isNumber":"9564395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9564393","xplore-issue":"9564395","articleId":"9565086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9565150,"authors":[{"name":"Dror Regev","affiliation":["Toga Networks, Huawei Company, Hod Hasharon, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/9629436/9565150/regev-3113187-small.gif","p":["Dror Regev (Member, IEEE) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Ben-Gurion University, Be\u2019er Sheva, Israel, in 1987, and the M.Sc. degree in management from Boston University, Boston, MA, USA, in 1994.

The QCQH comprises three quarter-wavelength transmission lines and a 90\u00b0 non-reciprocal phase shifter (NRPS) and is suitable for inband full duplex applications. We derive the four-port S-parameter matrix of the QCQH and the transfer functions under termination scenarios of interest. The resulting closed-form expressions are compared with the prior art electronic circulator. A 90\u00b0 transmission line and lumped transformer alternatives are considered for designing a QCQH based on a two-port N-path circuit. TX isolation and transmission expressions are derived and verified against simulations, and a new wideband leakage cancellation approach is proposed. A TSMC 65 nm CMOS N-path chip is integrated on-board with a discrete, lumped, LCL transformer implementation. TX-to-antenna insertion loss of 1.4 dB and an RX NF of 4.7 dB at the frequency of 1 GHz were measured with a primary passive TX-RX isolation of 21 dB. Total isolation of more than 50 dB for an 80 MHz OFDM WiFi TX signal employing digitally equalized active leakage cancellation was achieved along with better than \u221240 dB TX EVM with SIC

reinforces security. Unlike supervised methods, unsupervised methods are not widely used although they are fast and efficient. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach based on the K-means method to show the efficacy of these models over the supervised methods. The proposed model improves the K-means method using the Caliniski Harabasz indicator to find the appropriate number of clusters required for clustering by computing the intra-cluster to inter-cluster ratio. Above all, the proposed model is applied to two datasets, the well-known NSL-KDD and the newest CICIDS2017. The experimental results show that the proposed model exceeds largely the traditional K-means method. Additionally, it is also very efficient both in detection and time consuming compared to the SVM classifier that is a supervised classifier.","doi":"10.1109/ICCMA53594.2021.00021","publicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Computing, Computational Modelling and Applications (ICCMA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Computing, Computational Modelling and Applications (ICCMA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9565161/9565162/09565188.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCMA53594.2021.00021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9565162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Enhanced approach of the K-means clustering for Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 July 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565188/","displayDocTitle":"An Enhanced approach of the K-means clustering for Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9565188/","conferenceDate":"14-16 July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"12 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Enhanced approach of the K-means clustering for Anomaly-based intrusion detection systems","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"256700a078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057602S","chronDate":"14-16 July 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565161","isNumber":"9565162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565161","xplore-issue":"9565162","articleId":"9565188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9565193,"authors":[{"name":"Isaac Baffour Senkyire","affiliation":["Ghana Communication Technology University, Ghana","Cyber Security Division, CRITAC, Ghana","CRITAC, Ghana"],"firstName":"Isaac Baffour","lastName":"Senkyire","id":"37088842836"},{"name":"Quist-Aphetsi Kester","affiliation":["Ghana Communication Technology University, Ghana","Cyber Security Division, CRITAC, Ghana","CRITAC, Ghana"],"firstName":"Quist-Aphetsi","lastName":"Kester","id":"37085338719"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2567-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2568-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9565193","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565193","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hash functions","Ethics","Forensics","Organizations","Tools","Information age","Cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cryptography","digital forensics","digital storage","document handling","file organisation","law"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["legal damages","cryptographic tamper detection approach","forensic digital data","SHA 384 hash function","legal documents","official documents","confidential documents","digital channels","stakeholders","digital age","sophisticated tools","intelligent tools","modern computing tools","computational drawing tools","original documents","economic damages","political damages","sensitive documents","electronic telecommunication","documents tampered","age permits","content authentication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cryptographic","tamper detection","SHA \u2013384","hash function","content authentication"]}],"abstract":"The current age permits for legal, official, sensitive, and confidential documents to be exchanged using digital channels among stakeholders.

Square root (SQR) computation is a fundamental and complex operation in various signal/image processing tasks. It demands high resource and energy consumption, making the square-rooter a crucial design element. This brief proposes a low-complexity logarithmic-based energy-efficient approximate square rooter (LESQ) for computing integer SQR using simple addition and shift operations. A partial error compensation scheme is also suggested for improved accuracy. The proposed approximate square rooter also enables various accuracy configurable modes to tradeoff error with hardware efficiency for targeted application requirements. LESQ achieves energy- and area-delay savings of up to 80% and 60%, respectively, compared to an accurate array-based square-rooter design. The proposed approximate design is tested on error-tolerant applications, such as image processing and amplitude modulation (AM) communication system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Logarithmic Square Rooter for Error-Resilient Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3114616","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9594522/09565212.pdf","startPage":"1994","endPage":"1997","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3114616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565212/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Logarithmic Square Rooter for Error-Resilient Applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/9565212/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Logarithmic Square Rooter for Error-Resilient Applications","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-arya-3114616-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057939S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9594522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9594522","articleId":"9565212","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":9565224,"authors":[{"name":"Tharun Kumar Reddy","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/9653737/9565224/reddy-3113823-small.gif","p":["Tharun Kumar Reddy received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, Kanpur, India, in 2013, and the M.Tech.\u2013Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from IIT Kanpur in 2020.","He is an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India.

The approach presented herein identifies the cognitive state of the user while no mental action is required. Data recorded in EEG-based BCI experiments are generally noisy, nonstationary, and contaminated with artifacts that can deteriorate any analyzer\u2019s performance. Recently, common spatial patterns (CSPs) have been adapted with EEG state-space incorporating spatiospectral optimization using fuzzy time delay (FTD-CSSP). Temporal phase disparity sequence (TPDS) is used to measure synchrony between EEG signals. The output of Linear transforms operating on the TPDS constitute useful features for EEG regression problems. On similar lines, this article proposes spatiospectral optimized fuzzy-independent phase-locking value (SSO-FIPLV) representations (exploiting the spatiospectral information from TPDS) for EEG signals to monitor a user\u2019s cognitive states. Specifically, we analyze changes in EEG synchronization for a car driver as she/he drifts between alert and drowsy states. We use neural networks (NNs) for prediction. This article also proposes a cutting-edge method for training NN using the Euler\u2013Lagrangian formulation. A stability proof is provided for the intended training approach alongside, and the performance is corroborated on the EEG reaction time prediction task, both within and across subjects, using a publicly available dataset. The NN trained by the proposed approach performs better than other competitive approaches in terms of minimizing root-mean-squared error and maximizing correlation coefficient. Channelwise feature importance in terms of average relevance values calculated from NN feature representations is visualized in the form of Topoplots using layerwise relevance propagation for regression.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2021.3113823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","startPage":"101","endPage":"111","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2021.3113823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9653737","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/9653737/09565224.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Artificial neural networks","Optimization","Feature extraction","Signal processing algorithms","Fuzzy neural networks","Vehicles"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain\u2013computer interface (BCI)","electroencephalogram (EEG)","fuzzy time-delay common spatiospectral patterns (FTD-CSSP)","Lagrangian","neural networks (NNs)","reaction time (RT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"EEG-Based Drowsiness Detection With Fuzzy Independent Phase-Locking Value Representations Using Lagrangian-Based Deep Neural Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565224/","volume":"52","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9565224/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2021","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEG-Based Drowsiness Detection With Fuzzy Independent Phase-Locking Value Representations Using Lagrangian-Based Deep Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tsmc-behera-3113823-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107047S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"9653737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","xplore-issue":"9653737","articleId":"9565224","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":9565245,"authors":[{"name":"Koshi Hamano","affiliation":["SUMITOMO ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES, LTD., Ofuna, Japan"],"firstName":"Koshi","lastName":"Hamano","id":"37085826372"},{"name":"Hayato Shimizu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Hayato","lastName":"Shimizu","id":"37088358927"},{"name":"Kenjiro Nishikawa","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenjiro","lastName":"Nishikawa","id":"37280724600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3391-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3392-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9565245","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Millimeter wave circuits","Broadband amplifiers","PHEMTs","Gallium arsenide","Topology","Power conversion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["millimeter-wave","E-band","Doherty amplifier","broadband","MMIC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565245","abstract":"This paper investigates phase offset impact on millimeter-wave broadband Doherty amplifier MMIC based on reduced-$\\alpha$ DPA topology. The analysis results clarify the limited amplitude and phase variation to realize the desired performances of the Doherty amplifier. On the E-band $0.1 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ GaAs pHEMT Doherty amplifier, the amplitude and the phase variations at the amplifier outputs must be kept below 1dB and 15 degrees to achieve more than 16% power conversion efficiency, respectively. The results also indicate that the phase variation on the main amplifier side has a larger impact on the overall performances than on the peak amplifier side. The same condition mentioned above applies to the amplitude and the phase variations on the combining and dividing circuits.

In this paper, we consider a fully-connected hybrid precoding architecture with finite resolution phase shifters. Basically, we first obtain the phases of optimal precoder and combiner, which is obtained through the singular value decomposition (SVD) operation of channel vectors, then these phases are used to construct the RF precoder and combiner. The results show that the proposed algorithm improves the capacity and reduces the complexity compared to the existing orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based algorithm. Besides, an adaptive solution is further proposed to save computational time with competitive performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Radio-Frequency Integration Technology (RFIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9565225/9565198/09565251.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Radio-Frequency Integration Technology (RFIT)","doi":"10.1109/RFIT52905.2021.9565251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIT52905.2021.9565251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9565198","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Hybrid Beamforming Schemes in Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Power demand","Costs","Precoding","Phase shifters","Millimeter wave technology","Matching pursuit algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["beamforming","multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)","millimeter-wave (mm-wave)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Hybrid Beamforming Schemes in Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9565251/","publicationDate":"25 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005144","fundingName":"Qualcomm"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Hybrid Beamforming Schemes in Millimeter Wave MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Hualien, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"210017_FP.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029983S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565225","isNumber":"9565198","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565225","xplore-issue":"9565198","articleId":"9565251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9565261,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Cheng Lai","affiliation":["Bachelor Program in Industrial Projects, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C.","National Yulin University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Wen-Cheng","lastName":"Lai","id":"38548569800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3391-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3392-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9565261","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Radio frequency","Local oscillators","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Switches","Receivers","Power system harmonics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["low power consumption","voltage controlled oscillator","even harmonic mixer","four phase local oscillator switching"]}],"abstract":"A low voltage, and phase noise Colpitts voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with even harmonic mixer and balun for 5.8-GHz-band application is proposed and implemented in tsmc 0.18-um CMOS process.

undersampling free-space optical (FSO) communication system based on compressive sensing (CS) and in-fiber grating is proposed. Our proposal drastically mitigates the data scale unfavorable issue and reduces the great amount of required data. Also, our proposal employs low-bandwidth and low-cost photodetectors (PDs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and decreases the cost of data detection. Besides, the data transmitted in the free space is encrypted, which enhances the security of the system. The in-fiber grating, which has the advantage of highly efficient thanks to its inherent compatibility with optical fiber links, plays the roles of light emitter, in-fiber polarizer, and light diffraction device, simultaneously. A sinusoidal radio frequency (RF) signal with a frequency of 1 GHz is utilized for a 2.4 m data transmission. And each PD with a bandwidth of 300 MHz is employed for detecting the transmitted signal on each channel. The proposal obtains data compression ratios of 25%, 15%, and 5% both in the temporal domain and frequency domain. Besides, a two-tone signal and a random RF signal are applied in the proposed FSO transmission for data transmission. Our proposal not only has the merits of secure, compact, stable, and highly efficient, but also has great potential in extremely secure situations, such as secured indoor and under water data communication.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","Optical fiber polarization","Diffraction","Communication systems","Optical polarization","Fiber gratings","Data communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber gratings","diffractive optics","free-space communication","fiber optics systems","photodetectors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3118699","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/9583306/09565326.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9583306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2021.3118699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Undersampling Communication System Based on Compressive Sensing and In-Fiber Grating","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Undersampling Communication System Based on Compressive Sensing and In-Fiber Grating","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565326/","volume":"13","issue":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7300507","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9565326/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2021T140296"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Department of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"2021A0505080002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012449","fundingName":"Southern University of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"Y01236128"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100018919","fundingName":"Peng Cheng Laboratory","grantNumber":"LZC0019 and LZC0020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Undersampling Communication System Based on Compressive Sensing and In-Fiber Grating","sourcePdf":"jphot-shao-3118699-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082699S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"9583306","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","xplore-issue":"9583306","articleId":"9565326","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9565336,"authors":[{"name":"Parimala Kancharla","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Parimala","lastName":"Kancharla","orcid":"0000-0003-0939-6358"},{"name":"Sumohana S.

A recent neuroscience study hypothesizes that the perceptual representations of a sequence of frames extracted from a natural video follow a straight temporal trajectory. The perceptual representations of a sequence of video frames are found using a computational model of the LGN and V1 areas of the human visual system. In this work, we leverage the strength of this perceptual straightening model to formulate a novel objective function for video frame prediction. In general, a frame prediction model takes past frames as input and predicts the future frame. We enforce the perceptual straightness constraint through adversarial training by introducing the proposed novel quality aware discriminator loss. Our quality aware discriminator imposes the linear relationship between the perceptual representation of the predicted frame and the perceptual representations of the past frames.Specifically, we claim that imposing a perceptual straightness constraint through the discriminator helps in predicting (i.e., generating) video frames that look more natural and therefore, having a higher perceptual quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed objective function on two popular video datasets using three different frame prediction models. These experiments show that our solution is both consistent and stable, thereby allowing it to be integrated with other frame prediction models as well.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3118639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09565336.pdf","startPage":"2167","endPage":"2171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3118639","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565336/","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Visual Quality of Video Frame Prediction Models Using the Perceptual Straightening Hypothesis","volume":"28","publicationDate":"2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9565336/","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Visual Quality of Video Frame Prediction Models Using the Perceptual Straightening Hypothesis","sourcePdf":"lsp-kancharla-3118639-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047842S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9565336","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":9565338,"authors":[{"name":"Binquan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei,, China"],"firstName":"Binquan","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-7789-196X"},{"name":"Guoqi Ma","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Guoqi","lastName":"Ma","orcid":"0000-0001-7988-212X"},{"name":"Ming Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei,, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Zhu"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9565338","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Dictionaries","Visualization","Feature extraction","Cameras","Supervised learning","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Person re-identification (re-ID)","momentum contrast","representation learning"]}],"abstract":"Person re-identification (re-ID) aims to identify the same persons\u2019 images across different cameras by deploying a trained re-ID model. Nevertheless, the domain bias between different datasets can lead to considerably low identification accuracy when directly applying a trained re-ID model from one dataset to another. Therefore, in order to develop a kind of more transferable re-ID methods with strong robustness, this letter proposes a fast momentum contrast learning framework, which consists of a teacher encoder and a fast momentum encoder, from a reinforcing visual representation learning point of view. The fast momentum encoder produced by the teacher encoder is employed to build a dynamic dictionary and then design the contrast learning loss function together with the teacher encoder. In addition, both the individual loss and the clustering loss are adopted for obtaining the optimal performances in unsupervised person re-ID models. The proposed framework achieves one stage of end-to-end training and experimental results demonstrate that our identification accuracy outperforms existing advanced methods. \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">The code of this work is available at <uri>https://github.com/binquanwang/FMCL_UDA</uri>.</i>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Momentum Contrast Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3118564","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09565338.pdf","startPage":"2073","endPage":"2077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3118564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565338/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Fast Momentum Contrast Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9565338/","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"New generation wireless mobile communication network","grantNumber":"2017ZX030010"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Momentum Contrast Learning for Unsupervised Person Re-Identification","sourcePdf":"lsp-wang-3118564-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.227461S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9565338","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":9565351,"authors":[{"name":"Chengzhao Shan","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Chengzhao","lastName":"Shan","orcid":"0000-0003-0663-3565"},{"name":"Jun Shi","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Shi","orcid":"0000-0001-6194-4433"},{"name":"Yongkui Ma","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yongkui","lastName":"Ma"},{"name":"Xuejun Sha","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xuejun","lastName":"Sha","orcid":"0000-0002-6204-0839"},{"name":"Yuhang Liu","affiliation":["NARI Technology Development Company, Ltd, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuhang","lastName":"Liu"},{"name":"Honglin Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Honglin","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0003-1178-7550"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-4553"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0484"}],"articleNumber":"9565351","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Radar","Amplitude modulation","Modulation","Power harmonic filters","Signal processing algorithms","OFDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radar-communication integration","power loss","sideband optimization","time-modulated array"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Loss Suppression for Time-Modulated Arrays in Radar-Communication Integration","abstract":"In order to minimize the weight and volume of the radio frequency equipment while alleviating the shortage of spectrum resources, electronic system integration has become a topical area in both civil and military fields, and the radar-communications integrated technology based on the time-modulated array (TMA) has also been proposed due to its low complexity and easy reconfiguration property. The TMA has power losses caused by sideband signals radiation, which is inherent drawback. However, existing TMA power loss optimization methods are not suitable for radar-communication integration, because of the existence of multiple harmonic components. In this paper, a closed-form expression of TMA power losses for radar-communications integration is derived and the sideband radiation is optimized. Firstly, some preliminaries about TMA are shown. Then, the radar-communications integration strategy based on TMA is introduced. Moreover, a closed-form expression of TMA power losses caused by sideband signals radiation is derived, and the direct power losses optimization method is proposed based on the derived results. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by simulations.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565351","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/9634701/09565351.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9634701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3118896","startPage":"1365","endPage":"1377","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3118896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565351/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","displayDocTitle":"Power Loss Suppression for Time-Modulated Arrays in Radar-Communication Integration","isDynamicHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9565351/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","isJournal":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61871153 and 620711747"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"HIT.

Existing studies mostly assume full-duplex radio for radar receiver based on perfect self-interference cancellation. However, the self-interference may not be fully cancelled in practice. In this paper, imperfect self-interference cancellation is considered. To combat the strong self-interference, a novel JCRS is developed based on IEEE 802.11ad orthogonal frequency division multiplex physical-layer (OFDM PHY) for multi-target sensing. More specifically, the received radar signal is designed to be synchronized with self-interference, and two radar sensing functions are developed for short-range sensing and long-range sensing separately. The synchronization with self-interference resolves the difficulty in self-interference calibration in short-range sensing and prevents the inter-subcarrier-interference (ICI) from self-interference in long-range sensing. The Golay sequences in the preamble are leveraged to combat self-interference for short-range sensing, thanks to the relatively strong reflection signal. For long-range sensing, the pilot signal and a few self-interference-free OFDM symbols at the end of the data frame are leveraged to combat self-interference. Particularly, a novel pilot signal design is first developed to achieve subcarrier-wise pulse radar for accurate velocity and coarse range estimation, and then the self-interference-free OFDM symbols are utilized to achieve accurate range estimation.

The variations in trophic states regarding seasonality and the changes of spectral properties of water bodies pose uncertainties to the accuracy of remote sensing semiempirical models.

This is mainly due to the image sensor readout, which permanently captures the image at a fixed rate and produces a relatively high throughput bitstream. Therefore, finding techniques minimizing the data throughput helps to drastically reduce power. Event-based image sensors are able to capture images with a low throughput bistream, thanks to a sample strategy eliminating temporal and spatial redundancies. This natively gives a data-compressed image, which favors lower storage and computation. This article presents an event-based image sensor incorporating a hybrid pixel matrix composed of two pixel types and an arbiterless asynchronous readout system. The results show an important bitstream reduction compared to that of a standard CMOS image sensor. A testchip of our event-based image sensor has been designed and is currently under fabrication.","doi":"10.1109/ASYNC48570.2021.00016","publicationTitle":"2021 27th IEEE International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (ASYNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 27th IEEE International Symposium on Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (ASYNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9565432/9565433/09565444.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASYNC48570.2021.00016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9565433","startPage":"55","endPage":"61","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An asynchronous hybrid pixel image sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565444","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An asynchronous hybrid pixel image sensor","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565444/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9565444/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An asynchronous hybrid pixel image sensor","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"413200a055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052654S","chronDate":"7-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565432","isNumber":"9565433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565432","xplore-issue":"9565433","articleId":"9565444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9565509,"authors":[{"name":"Saed Rezayi","affiliation":["University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Saed","lastName":"Rezayi","id":"38230343800"},{"name":"Saber Soleymani","affiliation":["University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Saber","lastName":"Soleymani","id":"37088997670"},{"name":"Hamid R.

However, the small variety of colors and the influence of the illumination in the environment make fine-grained vehicle color recognition a challenge task. Insufficient training data and small color categories in previous datasets causes the low recognition accuracy and the inflexibility of practical using. Meanwhile, the inefficient feature learning also leads to poor recognition performance of the previous methods. Therefore, we collect a rear shooting dataset from vehicle bayonet monitoring for fine-grained vehicle color recognition. Its images can be divided into 11 main-categories and 75 color subcategories according to the proposed labeling algorithm which can eliminate the influence of illumination and assign the color annotation for each image. We propose a novel recognition model which can effectively identify the vehicle colors. We skillfully interpolate the Transformer into recognition model to enhance the feature learning capacity of conventional neural networks, and specially design a hierarchical loss function through in-depth analysis of the proposed dataset. We evaluate the designed recognition model on the dataset and it can achieve accuracy of 97.77%, which is superior to the traditional approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565515/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9565515/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Transformer based Neural Network for Fine-Grained Classification of Vehicle Color","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010450","fundingName":"Nova"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transformer based Neural Network for Fine-Grained Classification of Vehicle Color","confLoc":"Tokyo, Japan","sourcePdf":"186500a118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.242572S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565453","isNumber":"9565456","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565453","xplore-issue":"9565456","articleId":"9565515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9565623,"authors":[{"name":"Terence Griffin","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Terence","lastName":"Griffin","id":"37088554123"},{"name":"Qilei Chen","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Qilei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086810412"},{"name":"Xinzi Sun","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Xinzi","lastName":"Sun","id":"37087136052"},{"name":"Dechun Wang","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Lowell, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Dechun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37087135492"},{"name":"Maria J.

Treatment of this disease and reduction in local epidemics can be improved markedly by increasing the speed and efficiency of screening and diagnosis. eRxNet is a pipeline of convolutional neural networks designed to provide healthcare professionals with detailed and accurate analysis of chest X-rays (CXRs) for TB screening. The pipeline combines whole image classification, object detection (bounding boxes), and instance segmentation (polygonal masks) to provide data analysis at varying levels of detail. In order to construct a high performing system, a comparison of different CNN architectures applied to these tasks is presented. Images from two large TB datasets, UML-Peru and TBX11K, were used for training and evaluation of the models. Combining the two datasets required the development of a preprocessing stage which includes lung segmentation and image enhancement. We show that the resulting four stage pipeline of CNNs, using a combination of DenseNet, Faster R-CNN, and Mask R-CNN, has sufficiently strong performance to be a useful tool for TB screening.","doi":"10.1109/TransAI51903.2021.00017","startPage":"47","endPage":"56","publicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Transdisciplinary AI (TransAI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TransAI51903.2021.00017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9565608","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 Third International Conference on Transdisciplinary AI (TransAI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9565568/9565608/09565623.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"eRxNet: A Pipeline of Convolutional Neural Networks for Tuberculosis Screening","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565623/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"eRxNet: A Pipeline of Convolutional Neural Networks for Tuberculosis Screening","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9565623/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"eRxNet: A Pipeline of Convolutional Neural Networks for Tuberculosis Screening","confLoc":"Laguna Hills, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"341200a047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10509S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565568","isNumber":"9565608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565568","xplore-issue":"9565608","articleId":"9565623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":9565660,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wan","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wan","id":"37088995585"},{"name":"Quanmin Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Quanmin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088945219"},{"name":"Shuang Zheng","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37088943669"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2711-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2712-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9565660","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Computational modeling","Neurons","Telecommunication traffic","Network security","Benchmark testing","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software-defined Networking","Intrusion Detection","DDoS Attack","Deep Learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565660","abstract":"As a new network paradigm, Software-defined networking (SDN) realizes centralized management of the network by separating the control plane and the data plane.

In order to solve the problem that the Successive-over relaxation (SOR) iteration cannot directly obtain the inverse of the matrix in the massive MIMO system, and the iteration speed is slow, based on SORMI and Chebyshev iteration, we propose a joint precoding algorithm to speed up iteration and obtain better bit error rate performance. It can be seen from the simulation results that, compared with the RZF-SOR and SORMI algorithms, the joint algorithm has a faster convergence rate, and can obtain better bit error rate performance and matrix inversion accuracy with fewer iterations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Computer Communication and Network Security (CCNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9565594/9565595/09565671.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"125","publicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Computer Communication and Network Security (CCNS)","doi":"10.1109/CCNS53852.2021.00031","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCNS53852.2021.00031","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9565595","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive MIMO joint precoding algorithm based on SORMI and Chebyshev iteration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Precoding","Simulation","Bit error rate","Massive MIMO","Chebyshev approximation","Network security","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","matrix inversion","Chebyshev iteration","Successive over-relaxed matrix inversion","joint precoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2021-Aug. 1 2021","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO joint precoding algorithm based on SORMI and Chebyshev iteration","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9565671/","publicationDate":"July 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","conferenceDate":"30 July-1 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MIMO joint precoding algorithm based on SORMI and Chebyshev iteration","confLoc":"Xining, China","sourcePdf":"271100a122.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048578S","chronDate":"July 30 2021-Aug. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565594","isNumber":"9565595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565594","xplore-issue":"9565595","articleId":"9565671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9565688,"authors":[{"name":"Jawad Rasheed","affiliation":["Istanbul Aydin University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Jawad","lastName":"Rasheed","id":"37869759100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0176-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0177-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9565688","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565688","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Computational modeling","Learning (artificial intelligence)","Fish","Feature extraction","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aquaculture","learning (artificial intelligence)","marine pollution","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sustainable deep","computationally intelligent seafood monitoring system","omega-3 fatty acid","baby-growth","high mercury","automatic seafood classification system","intelligent seafood classification system","effective deep learning","computationally intelligent system","different fish species","Scale Fish Dataset","Red Mullet fish"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convolutional neural network","fish identification","fish type screening","deep learning"]}],"abstract":"Seafood being one of the major source of omega-3 fatty acid, is widely consumed around the world, thus at the same time affects baby-growth due to high mercury.

Previous research primarily focused on supervised learning, when all samples are labeled. And unsupervised learning is used, when all samples are unlabeled. However, many settings do not satisfy the above two situations. Recently, there are some studies on the situations that anomalies are partially observed (e.g., Anomaly Detection with partially Observed Anomalies). It is generally believed that the anomalies are classifiable in these studies. And it is common that the types of observed anomalies cannot include all types of anomalies in the case of partially observed anomalies. We refer to this problem as anomaly detection with partially observed anomaly types and propose a two-stage anomaly detection algorithm in this condition. The proposed method in this paper is based on Anomaly Detection with partially Observed Anomalies and is available in the new setting. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method both in the case of insufficient types of observed anomalies and in the case of sufficient types of observed anomalies. Besides, anomaly detection with partially observed anomaly types avoids the use of hyper-parameter and has high generality in different datasets.","doi":"10.1109/CCNS53852.2021.00028","publicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Computer Communication and Network Security (CCNS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 2nd International Conference on Computer Communication and Network Security (CCNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9565594/9565595/09565697.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"107","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCNS53852.2021.00028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9565595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection with Partially Observed Anomaly Types","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2021-Aug. 1 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565697/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection with Partially Observed Anomaly Types","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9565697/","conferenceDate":"30 July-1 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection with Partially Observed Anomaly Types","confLoc":"Xining, China","sourcePdf":"271100a098.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060575S","chronDate":"July 30 2021-Aug. 1 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565594","isNumber":"9565595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565594","xplore-issue":"9565595","articleId":"9565697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9565712,"authors":[{"name":"Munawara Saiyara Munia","affiliation":["Predictive Analytics and Technologies Laboratory, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Munawara Saiyara","lastName":"Munia","id":"37086067071"},{"name":"Seyyed MohammadSaleh Hosseini","affiliation":["Predictive Analytics and Technologies Laboratory, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Seyyed MohammadSaleh","lastName":"Hosseini","id":"37085543515"},{"name":"Mehrdad Nourani","affiliation":["Predictive Analytics and Technologies Laboratory, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Nourani","id":"37273839500"},{"name":"Jay Harvey","affiliation":["The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jay","lastName":"Harvey","id":"37085498354"},{"name":"Hina Dave","affiliation":["The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Hina","lastName":"Dave","id":"37088475940"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0132-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2980-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2575-2634"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2575-2626"}],"articleNumber":"9565712","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565712","abstract":"Epilepsy is a socially-stigmatizing chronic neurological condition. Limited availability of seizure Electroencephalogram (EEG) data makes the application of machine learning techniques for epileptic seizure detection very challenging. In this work, an efficient algorithmic procedure is proposed to facilitate the learning and classification of epileptic seizures from imbalanced EEG data. We designed an end-to-end architecture by combining local binary pattern with Siamese convolutional neural network. We used local binary pattern due to its capability to capture distinguishable morphological characteristics in the EEG signal. Siamese convolutional neural network was used since it can learn a similarity metric using an extremely small number of training samples for seizure episodes. With availability of a very small amount of training (seizure) samples, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by comparing the Siamese convolutional neural network with a baseline convolutional neural network.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions have received particular attention whereas a large part of clinical data is stockpiled into unstructured physician or nursing notes. In this respect, we attempt to employ NLP to provide an early prediction of the medical specialties at hospital admission. The study uses a large-scale dataset including more than 260K ED records provided by the Amiens-Picardy University Hospital in France. Our approach aims to integrate structured data with unstructured textual notes recorded at the triage stage. On one hand, a standard MLP model is used against the typical set of features. On the other hand, a Convolutional Neural Network is used to operate over the textual data. While both learning components are conducted independently in parallel. The empirical results demonstrated a promising accuracy in general. It is conceived that the study could be an additional contribution to the mounting efforts of applying NLP methods in the healthcare domain.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NLP-Based Prediction of Medical Specialties at Hospital Admission Using Triage Notes","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 9th International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","doi":"10.1109/ICHI52183.2021.00103","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 9th International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9565698/9565699/09565791.pdf","startPage":"548","endPage":"553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHI52183.2021.00103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9565699","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"NLP-Based Prediction of Medical Specialties at Hospital Admission Using Triage Notes","conferenceDate":"9-12 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9565791/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NLP-Based Prediction of Medical Specialties at Hospital Admission Using Triage Notes","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"013200a548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060348S","chronDate":"9-12 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565698","isNumber":"9565699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565698","xplore-issue":"9565699","articleId":"9565791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9565794,"authors":[{"name":"Zelalem Gero","affiliation":["Emory University, Atlanta, USA"],"firstName":"Zelalem","lastName":"Gero","id":"37088933374"},{"name":"Joyce C.

This provides an opportunity to leverage automated computer systems in assisting healthcare workers. One of the least utilized but rich source of patient information is the unstructured clinical text. In this work, we develop CATAN, a chart-aware temporal attention network for learning patient representations from clinical notes. We introduce a novel representation where each note is considered a single unit, like a sentence, and composed of attention-weighted words. The notes in turn are aggregated into a patient representation using a second weighting unit, note attention. Unlike standard attention computations which focus only on the content of the note, we incorporate the chart-time for each note as a constraint for attention calculation. This allows our model to focus on notes closer to the prediction time. Using the MIMIC-III dataset, we empirically show that our patient representation and attention calculation achieves the best performance in comparison with various state-of-the-art baselines for one-year mortality prediction and 30-day hospital readmission. Moreover, the attention weights can be used to offer transparency into our model\u2019s predictions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hospitals","Conferences","Computational modeling","MIMICs","Predictive models","Informatics","Electronic medical records"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565794","doi":"10.1109/ICHI52183.2021.00024","startPage":"83","endPage":"92","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 9th International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 9th International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9565698/9565699/09565794.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9565699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHI52183.2021.00024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565794/","displayDocTitle":"CATAN: Chart-aware temporal attention network for adverse outcome prediction","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9565794/","conferenceDate":"9-12 Aug. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100018696","fundingName":"Health"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CATAN: Chart-aware temporal attention network for adverse outcome prediction","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"013200a083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115749S","chronDate":"9-12 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565698","isNumber":"9565699","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565698","xplore-issue":"9565699","articleId":"9565794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9565817,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and School of Artificial Intelligence, Optics and Electronics (iOPEN), Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-1143-2082"},{"name":"Feiping Nie","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Interaction and Applications (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology), School of Computer Science, School of Artificial Intelligence, and Optics and Electronics (iOPEN), Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Feiping","lastName":"Nie","orcid":"0000-0002-0871-6519"},{"name":"Rong Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Interaction and Applications (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology), School of Computer Science, School of Artificial Intelligence, and Optics and Electronics (iOPEN), Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-9240-6726"},{"name":"Xuelong Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Interaction and Applications (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology), School of Computer Science, School of Artificial Intelligence, and Optics and Electronics (iOPEN), Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Xuelong","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-2924-946X"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9565817","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Graph-based dimensionality reduction methods are widely used in classification and clustering tasks due to their superior performance. The key to the performance of these methods is how to construct the graph. Although some existing methods can obtain an adaptive graph and a projection matrix simultaneously by combining manifold learning and graph construction in a unified framework, the linear constraint used in manifold learning is too hard. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method named adaptive flexible optimal graph (AFOG) for unsupervised dimensionality reduction. AFOG can obtain an adaptive flexible optimal graph by relaxing the linear constraint in the process of low-dimensional manifold mapping. At the same time, by using the principle of maximum separability, it can also obtain an effective projection matrix, which can solve out-of-sample problems. Experiments on six public benchmark data sets indicate that AFOG outperforms several other state-of-the-art methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Flexible Optimal Graph for Unsupervised Dimensionality Reduction","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3116521","endPage":"2166","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09565817.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","startPage":"2162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3116521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565817","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Principal component analysis","Manifolds","Manifold learning","Task analysis","Resource management","Optics","Entropy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive flexible optimal graph","dimensionality reduction","graph-based","unsupervised learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Flexible Optimal Graph for Unsupervised Dimensionality Reduction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565817/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9565817/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013290","fundingName":"National Key R&D Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1403501"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi","grantNumber":"2021JM-071"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62176212, 61936014 and 61772427"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"G2019KY0501"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Flexible Optimal Graph for Unsupervised Dimensionality Reduction","sourcePdf":"lsp-nie-3116521-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080338S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9565817","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":9565909,"authors":[{"name":"Abraham Akinin","affiliation":["University of California at San Diego (UCSD), La Jolla, CA, USA","Nanovision Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA","Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9583614/9565909/akini-3113648-small.gif","p":["Abraham Akinin (Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in biomedical engineering and physics from the University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA, in 2010, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in bioengineering from the University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA, in 2017 and 2020, respectively.","From 2018 to 2020, he was a Bioelectronics Design Engineer with Nanovision Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA, developing a scalable and power efficient retinal prosthesis.

In this regard, it is suggested to quantify the freshness of updates by using Age of Information (AoI) from the receiver\u2019s perspective. Specifically, the AoI measures the freshness over time. However, the freshness in the content is neglected. In this paper, we introduce an age-based utility, named as \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Age of Changed Information</i>\n (AoCI), which captures both the passage of time and the change of information content. By modeling the underlying physical process as a discrete time Markov chain, we investigate the AoCI in a time-slotted status update system, where a sensor samples the physical process and transmits the update packets to the destination. With the aim of minimizing the weighted sum of the AoCI and the update cost, we formulate an infinite horizon average cost Markov Decision Process. We show that the optimal updating policy has a special structure with respect to the AoCI and identify the condition under which the special structure exists. By exploiting the special structure, we provide a low complexity relative policy iteration algorithm that finds the optimal updating policy. We further investigate the optimal policy for two special cases. In the first case where the state of the physical process transits with equiprobability, we show that optimal policy is of threshold type and derive the closed-form of the optimal threshold. We then study a more generalized periodic Markov model of the physical process in the second case. Lastly, simulation results are laid out to exhibit the performance of the optimal updating policy and its superiority over the zero-wait baseline policy.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"578","endPage":"591","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09565910.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565910","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Markov processes","Mutual information","Monitoring","Measurement","Wireless sensor networks","Receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things","information freshness","Markov decision processes","structural analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Age of Changed Information: Content-Aware Status Updating in the Internet of Things","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9565910/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565910/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"State\u2019s Key Project of Research and Development Plan","grantNumber":"2019YFE0196400"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Research and Development Project in Key Areas","grantNumber":"2019B010158001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007471","fundingName":"Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation","grantNumber":"2021A1515012631 and 2019A1515011906"},{"fundingName":"Key Laboratory of Modern Measurement & Control Technology, Ministry of Education, Beijing Information Science & Technology University","grantNumber":"KF20201123202"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61701372"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005236","fundingName":"Chinese Universities Scientific Fund","grantNumber":"2452017560"},{"fundingName":"High-level Talents Fund of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"F2020221001"},{"fundingName":"Technological Innovation Fund of Shaanxi Academy of Forestry","grantNumber":"SXLK2021-0215"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Age of Changed Information: Content-Aware Status Updating in the Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"tcomm-xu-3119082-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096933S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9565910","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9565916,"authors":[{"name":"Ariel Podlubne","affiliation":["Chair of Adaptive Dynamic Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden (TUD), Dresden, Germany","Centre for Tactile Internet with Human-in-the-Loop (CeTI), Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden (TUD), Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9565916/podlu-3119061-small.gif","p":["Ariel Podlubne (Member, IEEE) received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineer from the National Technological University, Cord\u00f3ba, Argentina, in December 2012.

They are usually coupled with embedded computers but relying on software solutions not entirely suited for processing large amount of data concurrently and fast enough to keep real-time constrains. FPGAs are ideal candidates to enhance those systems computing capabilities while still being programmable. However, it is cumbersome to manually incorporate them into new or existing systems because providing accelerators with a specific integration capability limits their applicability. This work presents an approach to integrate multiple hardware accelerators into a robotic system. A model-based toolchain automatically generates the necessary hardware components (VHDL modules) from existing message specifications to exchange data with the accelerators. The goal is to seamlessly replace software components with FPGA-based ones while retaining the same communication interface. Instead of writing several hundred lines of VHDL, a dozen input specification lines are sufficient with our approach. The results are validated through an evaluation of all message specifications included in the latest Robot Operating System (ROS) versions. The 2295 messages evaluated show the robustness in our capabilities to support arbitrarily large ROS messages types, multiple data types, and nested messages.

The multiple eavesdroppers may overhear the confidential task offloading, which leads to information leakage. In order to address this issue, we present the minimization problem of the secrecy outage probability (SOP), by jointly taking into account the constraints from the latency and energy consumption. With the aim to improve the system secrecy performance, we then introduce three user selection criteria to choose the best user among multiple ones. Specifically, \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">criterion I</i>\n maximizes the locally computational capacity, while \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">criterion II</i>\n and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">III</i>\n maximize the secrecy capacity and data rate of main links, respectively. For these criteria, we further analyze the system secrecy performance by deriving analytical and asymptotic expressions for the SOP, from which we can conclude important insights for the system design. Finally, simulation and analytical results are provided to verify the proposed analysis. The results show that the three criteria can efficiently safeguard the MEC networks, compared to the traditional local computing and fully offloading, especially with a large value of user number.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"500","endPage":"513","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09565918.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565918","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Task analysis","Wireless communication","Energy consumption","Computational modeling","Interference","Probability","Power system reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Secure communication","mobile edge computing","user selection","latency","energy consumption","secrecy outage probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Secure Mobile Edge Computing Networks in the Presence of Multiple Eavesdroppers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9565918/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565918/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61871139/62101145"},{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Cooperation Projects of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2020A0505100060"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2021A1515011392"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100014881","fundingName":"Guangzhou University","grantNumber":"YK2020008/YJ2021003"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61971360"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"XJ2021KJZK007"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100015013","fundingName":"National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2021D05"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Mobile Edge Computing Networks in the Presence of Multiple Eavesdroppers","sourcePdf":"tcomm-fan-3119075-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118793S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9565918","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9565921,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Iacovelli","affiliation":["Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy","Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni, Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Iacovelli","orcid":"0000-0002-3551-4584"},{"name":"Angelo Coluccia","affiliation":["Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni, Parma, Italy","Universit\u00e0 del Salento, Lecce, Italy"],"firstName":"Angelo","lastName":"Coluccia","orcid":"0000-0001-7118-9734"},{"name":"Luigi Alfredo Grieco","affiliation":["Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy","Consorzio Nazionale Interuniversitario per le Telecomunicazioni, Parma, Italy"],"firstName":"Luigi Alfredo","lastName":"Grieco","orcid":"0000-0002-3443-6924"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9565921","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel models","Rician channels","Interference","Drones","Surface waves","Power system reliability","OFDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IRS","UAV","channel modeling","internet of drones"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Gain Lower Bound for IRS-Assisted UAV-Aided Communications","abstract":"The Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) capabilities of an Intelligent Reflective Surface (IRS) combined with the inherent versatility of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) can significantly enhance the communication quality between a Ground User (GU) and a Base Station (BS).

The intelligent fault diagnosis method has been widely used to accurately diagnose bearing faults. However, in engineering practice, it is difficult to obtain sufficient sample data to train the intelligent diagnosis model. Therefore, in this article, a fusion diagnosis model CGAN-2-D-CNN that combines a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) and a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2-D-CNN) is proposed for bearing fault diagnosis with small samples. Considering the problem of insufficient sample data, CGAN is used to learn the data distribution of real samples to generate new samples with similar data distribution by the confrontation training of the generator and discriminator. Then, 2-D preprocessing is conducted to convert the generated 1-D data into 2-D gray images. Finally, these images are input into the 2-D-CNN to extract the features and classify the bearing fault types. Two experimental cases are implemented to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed CGAN-2-D-CNN. The experimental results illustrate that the diagnosis accuracy of the proposed method used on the small sample data is close to that of the 2-D-CNN directly used on the enough original sample data whose size is equal to the expanded sample size. In addition, compared with the 1-D-CNN, support vector machine (SVM), and long short-term memory (LSTM) models, the 2-D-CNN model after 2-D preprocessing has the higher fault classification accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9565927/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","volume":"70","externalId":"3525712","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Conditional GAN and 2-D CNN for Bearing Fault Diagnosis With Small Samples","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51905422"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100017596","fundingName":"Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi","grantNumber":"2020JQ-630"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2020M673613XB"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conditional GAN and 2-D CNN for Bearing Fault Diagnosis With Small Samples","sourcePdf":"tim-liu-3119135-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086947S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"9259274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","xplore-issue":"9259274","articleId":"9565927","onlineDate":"08 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9565953,"authors":[{"name":"Anushka Singh","affiliation":["Master of technology, Netaji Subhas University of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Anushka","lastName":"Singh"},{"name":"Jyotsna Singh","affiliation":["Netaji Subhas University of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Jyotsna","lastName":"Singh"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3564-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3563-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0255-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2688-769X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2688-7681"}],"articleNumber":"9565953","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image forgery detection using Deep Neural Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565953","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Training","Image recognition","Transfer learning","Tools","Signal processing","Forgery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image tampering","convolution neural network (CNN)","error level analysis (ELA)","transfer learning","sharpening filter","fine-tuning"]}],"abstract":"Due to the availability of deep networks, progress has been made in the field of image recognition.

Simultaneous bidirectional transmission of 5Gbps orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based multi-band 16-QAM downlink signal and 5Gbps OFDM based 4-QAM uplink signal over a single fiber is demonstrated. The simultaneous copropagation over a single fiber reduces the infrastructure requirement by 50%, which also reduces the installation and maintenance cost. The multi-band signals for multi-serve applications are obtained at the user end by heterodyne beating of the downlink signal based on the requirement. The blank carrier for uplink transmission is extracted from the downlink signal with the tunable fiber Bragg grating (FBG) and modulated by the uplink signal. After 24km of bidirectional transmission, the error vector magnitude (EVM) has been estimated as 15.9% and 21.03% for downlink and uplink, respectively, below the FEC limit for transmission. The power penalty after transmission of 24km is 4.5dB and 2.3dB for downlink and uplink transmission, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/SPIN52536.2021.9565955","publicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9565880/9565936/09565955.pdf","startPage":"1069","endPage":"1073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIN52536.2021.9565955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9565936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Bidirectional Multiband OFDM based RoF Architecture for Simultaneous Transmission of Downlink and Uplink Signals over a Single Fiber with Mitigation of Nonlinear Effects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9565955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9565955/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Bidirectional Multiband OFDM based RoF Architecture for Simultaneous Transmission of Downlink and Uplink Signals over a Single Fiber with Mitigation of Nonlinear Effects","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"26 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9565955/","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Bidirectional Multiband OFDM based RoF Architecture for Simultaneous Transmission of Downlink and Uplink Signals over a Single Fiber with Mitigation of Nonlinear Effects","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"RP-193-355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050343S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565880","isNumber":"9565936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565880","xplore-issue":"9565936","articleId":"9565955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9565966,"authors":[{"name":"Abdul Qadir Khan","affiliation":["Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Abdul Qadir","lastName":"Khan","id":"37089000498"},{"name":"Harshit Yadav","affiliation":["Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Harshit","lastName":"Yadav","id":"37089000454"},{"name":"Paurush Bhulania","affiliation":["Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Paurush","lastName":"Bhulania","id":"37085376361"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3564-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3563-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0255-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2688-769X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2688-7681"}],"articleNumber":"9565966","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"abstract":"Design of two stage Complementry Metal Oxide Semiconductor Operational amplifier has presented in this work, where the OpAmp is designed on T-SPICE with the help of 180 nm technology, also with miller compensation technique for large gain and PSRR.

Sign language facilitates communication between the hearing and speech impaired person and the rest of society. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016, was also passed by the Indian government, which acknowledges Indian Sign Language (ISL) and mandates the use of sign language interpreters in all government-aided organizations and the public sector proceedings. Unfortunately, a large percentage of the Indian population is not familiar with the semantics of the gestures associated with ISL. To bridge this communication gap, this paper proposes a model to identify and classify Indian Sign Language gestures in real-time using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model has been developed using OpenCV and Keras implementation of CNNs and aims to classify 36 ISL gestures representing 0-9 numbers and A-Z alphabets by converting them to their text equivalents. The dataset created and used consists of 300 images for each gesture which were fed into the CNN model for training and testing purposes.

This paper presents a 10T SRAM cell at 22 nm FinFET technology to achieve improved write and read performance in the sub-threshold region. A write assist transistor incorporated in the latch structure helps the node voltages to flip easily during a write operation and improve the write performance. In addition, the issue of high and data-dependent read bitline leakage is resolved by maintaining similar operating conditions in the read port of un-selected cells independent of stored data. This enhances the read bitline voltage swing compared to the other CMOS cells. The FinFET based design of the cell maintains a high read current in the read port and reduces read access time. Compared to the conventional 8T CMOS cell, the proposed design provides 19 %, 99.9 % and 70 % improvement in RSNM, read access time and read bitline voltage swing respectively at 0.3 V. Apart from significant improvement observed in write margin and write access time, an improvement of 17 % and 77 % are also noted in hold static noise margin and retention voltage in the sub-threshold region.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"26 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9566009/","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A 22nm 10T FinFET SRAM Cell with Improved Write and Read performance in Sub-Threshold Region","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 22nm 10T FinFET SRAM Cell with Improved Write and Read performance in Sub-Threshold Region","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"RP-083-389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087704S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565880","isNumber":"9565936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565880","xplore-issue":"9565936","articleId":"9566009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9566010,"authors":[{"name":"Amulya Mahajan","affiliation":["Instrumentation and Control Engineering, Netaji Subhas University of Technology, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Amulya","lastName":"Mahajan","id":"37088998512"},{"name":"Vijander Singh","affiliation":["Instrumentation and Control Engineering, Netaji Subhas University of Technology, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Vijander","lastName":"Singh","id":"37596867500"},{"name":"Rishabh Srivastav","affiliation":["Instrumentation and Control Engineering, Netaji Subhas University of Technology, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Rishabh","lastName":"Srivastav","id":"37088999632"},{"name":"Sambhav Kapoor","affiliation":["Instrumentation and Control Engineering, Netaji Subhas University of Technology, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Sambhav","lastName":"Kapoor","id":"37088996090"},{"name":"Ekamjeet Singh","affiliation":["Instrumentation and Control Engineering, Netaji Subhas University of Technology, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Ekamjeet","lastName":"Singh","id":"37088997292"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3564-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3563-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0255-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2688-769X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2688-7681"}],"articleNumber":"9566010","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Emotion recognition","Image recognition","Convolution","Image databases","Face recognition","Neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Facial expression","facial recognition","emotion recognition","facial expression recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566010","abstract":"This paper focuses on facial emotion recognition with the help of a 2-channel convolution neural network.

The traditional methodology involves use of mammogram scan followed by various other clinical tests for assuring cancer prevailing in the body manually, which involves mistakes and delay in detection. Many times, it is detected using the biopsy method where tissue removed from the breast is studied under a microscope. This entire process is done by the histopathologies, and if he is not well trained, it may lead to wrong diagnosis. In order to improve the diagnosis by proper detection, automatic analysis of histopathology images has helped the pathologists in efficient diagnosis. Recently the Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have become a preferred deep learning method for breast cancer classification. In this paper, we have proposed CNN architecture based on Local Binary Pattern (LBP) images as input and then compare their classification results by a standard CNN based on origin images as input. Here, classification approach is proposed for automatic classification into either moderate stage or mild stage of cancer. An image dataset of 100 images is used in this approach and 80% of the dataset is used for training and the rest 20% of the images used for testing. 100% classification accuracy is obtained with CNN architecture.

It is regarded as an important bio-marker of blood perfusion in vital organs as compared to systolic blood pressure (SBP). The actual MAP can be determined by manual monitoring and complex calculations limited to occasional monitoring status. Growing personalized health care monitoring devices have already evinced a variety of health parameters to track on a daily basis with the additional advantage of continuous, noninvasive, and unobstructed measurement. This work proposes a direct strategy for the estimation of mean arterial pressure without using the systolic and diastolic BP values. By exploring 13 significant morphological features from a single PPG signal which are most related to the target MAP are derived such as Pulse Interval, Inflection Ratio etc. The estimation is performed using LSTM network with an architecture having 2- LSTM layers followed by a dropout and dense layer.

The standard metric used for the measurement of psoriasis severity and extent is known as Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). The dermatologists evaluate this score by using a sense of touch and visual examination, which is a manual, subjective, and tedious process. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a deep learning framework for a fully automatic and objective process for measuring one of the most important parameters of PASI i.e. psoriasis area score. A modified U-Net model is implemented for the intended task. The proposed method automatically segments the lesion and healthy skin regions along with background simultaneously from the raw colour images of psoriasis patients from different body regions. This helps in the automatic measurement of psoriasis lesion area from the entire skin region in terms of percentage, which provides PASI area score. The study involves 350 images from 80 different psoriasis patients. The results of the proposed method are encouraging for the automatic estimation of the PASI area score. The proposed model has also achieved better performance compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning-based models.","doi":"10.1109/SPIN52536.2021.9566039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIN52536.2021.9566039","startPage":"1137","endPage":"1142","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9565880/9565936/09566039.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9565936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning based Multi-Segmentation for Automatic Estimation of Psoriasis Area Score","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning based Multi-Segmentation for Automatic Estimation of Psoriasis Area Score","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","publicationDate":"26 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9566039/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566039/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning based Multi-Segmentation for Automatic Estimation of Psoriasis Area Score","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"RP-205-441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065435S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565880","isNumber":"9565936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565880","xplore-issue":"9565936","articleId":"9566039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9566065,"authors":[{"name":"Vipan Verma","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar, India"],"firstName":"Vipan","lastName":"Verma","id":"37088912388"},{"name":"Rajneesh Rani","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar, India"],"firstName":"Rajneesh","lastName":"Rani","id":"38232571400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3564-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3563-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0255-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2688-769X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2688-7681"}],"articleNumber":"9566065","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":21},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Computer vision","Image resolution","Image recognition","Face recognition","Brightness","Lighting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer Vision","Image processing","Deep Learning","Feature extraction and Selection techniques","Facial Expressions Recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566065","abstract":"Facial expression recognition technology has boomed over the past few years because of human-computer engagement.

So keeping it as a motivation, in our work, we aimed for such Deep CNN architecture, which can work on real-world images like images having various resolution, angles, poses, illumination, and brightness, etc. So for this, we have implemented our CNN architecture with the Kaggle challenge presented dataset FER-2013 and trained the model to recognize the basic seven expressions.

The results obtained using RNN are compared to the results obtained using Feed Forward Back propagation algorithm (FFBP). It is found that the derivatives obtained using RNN are very close to true values of derivatives with lesser standard deviation as compared to derivatives obtained using FFBP algorithm. The RNN is also validated by adding the various percentages of noises in the simulated flight data.

We apply the concept of space shift keying in satellite communication systems and discuss the outage probability of SSK based systems by using the derived result of c.d.f.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9565880/9565936/09566110.pdf","startPage":"1098","endPage":"1103","publicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","doi":"10.1109/SPIN52536.2021.9566110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIN52536.2021.9566110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9565936","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Distribution of the Difference of Two SR RV's and it's Application in Satellite Communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading channels","Rician channels","Probability density function","Software","Power system reliability","Random variables","Satellite communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Shadowed Rician","Satellite","Space Shift Keying","Difference distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"On the Distribution of the Difference of Two SR RV's and it's Application in Satellite Communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9566110/","publicationDate":"26 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Distribution of the Difference of Two SR RV's and it's Application in Satellite Communication","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"RP-198-333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082125S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565880","isNumber":"9565936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565880","xplore-issue":"9565936","articleId":"9566110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9566118,"authors":[{"name":"Kishori Shekokar","affiliation":["Navrachana University, Vadodara, Gujarat, India"],"firstName":"Kishori","lastName":"Shekokar","id":"37087353529"},{"name":"Shweta Dour","affiliation":["Navrachana University, Vadodara, Gujarat, India"],"firstName":"Shweta","lastName":"Dour","id":"37089001977"},{"name":"Gufran Ahmad","affiliation":["Dayalbagh Educational Institute (Deemed University), Agra, India"],"firstName":"Gufran","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37086039510"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3564-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3563-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0255-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2688-769X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2688-7681"}],"articleNumber":"9566118","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566118","abstract":"Epilepsy is a neurological disease which is non transmissible and affects across all ages. It is signalized by observing repetitions of seizures. Main causes of epilepsy are head injuries, low oxygen during birth, brain tumors, genetic conditions and infections like meningitis or encephalitis. A seizure came out whenever explosion of electrical impulses in brain elude their normal restricts. Traditional diagnosis techniques may take time to diagnose and it may differ in perfection as compared to automated system due to lack of expertization in each case. So this is a serious issue that disorder must be diagnose prior to the manifestation of behavioral symptoms. The main motive of this study is bestow expert model for recognizing disorders on basis of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data using Deep learning methodology. In this paper to detect epileptic seizures, author presented long short-term memory (LSTM) model on Bonn\u2019s EEG dataset. Metrics calculated to check the efficacy of the technique are accuracy, specificity and sensitivity.

Helping the machine identify the emotion and sentiment of the user plays a key role in making these interactions feel more natural. To do so, existing models for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) and Sentiment Analysis (SA) focus on the detection of either only emotion or sentiment on acted databases. Unlike these existing works, this work presents a simple model with a comparatively small speech feature vector, to detect both emotion and sentiment from the spontaneous database, Multimodal Emotion Lines Dataset (MELD). This contains voice samples similar to those in a real-time environment. Speech features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Entropy, Teager Energy Operator have been extracted from the voice samples and are classified using Logit Boost, Logistic and Multiclass classifier. The performance of the model is improved by using feature selection techniques such as Backward elimination and Gaussian distribution coefficients. The proposed model is simple, and the results are comparable to existing work on the MELD database.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9565880/9565936/09566147.pdf","startPage":"909","endPage":"915","publicationTitle":"2021 8th International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN)","doi":"10.1109/SPIN52536.2021.9566147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPIN52536.2021.9566147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9565936","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sentiment and Emotion Analysis for Effective Human-Machine Interaction during Covid-19 Pandemic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Analytical models","Emotion recognition","Databases","Speech recognition","Gaussian distribution","Signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech emotion recognition","sentiment analysis","feature selection","MELD","spontaneous dataset"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566147/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Sentiment and Emotion Analysis for Effective Human-Machine Interaction during Covid-19 Pandemic","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9566147/","publicationDate":"26 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","conferenceDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sentiment and Emotion Analysis for Effective Human-Machine Interaction during Covid-19 Pandemic","confLoc":"Noida, India","sourcePdf":"RP-164-234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122698S","chronDate":"26-27 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565880","isNumber":"9565936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565880","xplore-issue":"9565936","articleId":"9566147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9566193,"authors":[{"name":"Jianxin Shi","affiliation":["Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing (BDBC), Beijing, China","Beihang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianxin","lastName":"Shi","id":"37088990269"},{"name":"Rui Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing (BDBC), Beijing, China","Beihang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599475200"},{"name":"Muqing Xian","affiliation":["Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing (BDBC), Beijing, China","Beihang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Muqing","lastName":"Xian","id":"37088989615"},{"name":"Tianyu Wo","affiliation":["Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data and Brain Computing (BDBC), Beijing, China","Beihang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Tianyu","lastName":"Wo","id":"37410208900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3479-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3480-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9566193","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"abstract":"With the development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), various industrial intelligent applications are emerging, especially Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). The Health Condition Monitoring(HCM) of machines is an important part of PHM and has an essential purpose to improve the intelligence level of industrial machines. However, traditional monitoring methods are no longer suitable for the current adaptability, latency, bandwidth, and privacy requirements in IIoT. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven HCM architecture. Firstly, the Knowledge Distillation (KD) and a threshold method are respectively proposed for the cloud-edge collaborative training and inference mechanism. Secondly, a health condition representation method of multisensor signal data is proposed. Finally, experiments on the public rolling element bearing dataset show that our method can significantly improve latency and save bandwidth while ensuring accuracy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Condition monitoring","Training","Cloud computing","Collaboration","Rolling bearings","Computer architecture","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","condition monitoring","data privacy","fault diagnosis","groupware","inference mechanisms","Internet of Things","mechanical engineering computing","rolling bearings","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public rolling element bearing dataset","KD","knowledge distillation","industrial Internet of Things","data-driven health condition monitoring","multisensor signal data","inference mechanism","threshold method","novel data-driven HCM architecture","traditional monitoring methods","industrial machines","PHM","prognostics-health management","industrial intelligent applications","IIoT","cloud-edge collaborative architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Industrial Internet of Things","Cloud-edge Collaboration","Health Condition Monitoring","Knowledge Distillation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JCC53141.2021.00020","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Joint Cloud Computing (JCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Joint Cloud Computing (JCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9566158/9566161/09566193.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9566161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCC53141.2021.00020","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cloud-edge Collaborative Architecture for Data-driven Health Condition Monitoring of Machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566193","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Cloud-edge Collaborative Architecture for Data-driven Health Condition Monitoring of Machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566193/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9566193/","accessionNumber":"21226688","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006190","fundingName":"Research and Development"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cloud-edge Collaborative Architecture for Data-driven Health Condition Monitoring of Machines","confLoc":"Oxford, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"347900a051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072991S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9566158","isNumber":"9566161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9566158","xplore-issue":"9566161","articleId":"9566193","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9566205,"authors":[{"name":"Somchart Fugkeaw","affiliation":["Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, Thammasat University, Pathum Thani, Thailand"],"firstName":"Somchart","lastName":"Fugkeaw","id":"37294205000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3479-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3480-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9566205","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"This paper proposes a cryptographic-based access control that supports secure and efficient signcryption and decryption feature for data owners and data users in mobile cloud environment. At a core construct of our proposed scheme, a dual encryption based on AES encryption and ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and dual proxy model are integrated. In our model, data owners can encrypt and digitally sign a file by using AES key and their private key stored in the mobile devices respectively. The hash value calculation and CP-ABE encryption are outsourced to the delegated proxy called signcryption proxy. In the similar way, data users can use their mobile devices to decrypt the ciphertext encrypted by the AES key while the computing task of CP-ABE decryption is outsourced to another proxy called decryption proxy. Therefore, most extensive costs for digital signing, encryption, and decryption are offloaded to the proxies located in the cloud. This renders the confidentiality, authenticity, and non-repudiation along with the fine-grained access control for mobile cloud environment where both data owners and data users can use the mobile devices to share and access the data via cloud platform. In addition, we conducted performance evaluation to substantiate that our proposed scheme is efficient in practice.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Joint Cloud Computing (JCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9566158/9566161/09566205.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"79","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Joint Cloud Computing (JCC)","doi":"10.1109/JCC53141.2021.00024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCC53141.2021.00024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9566161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Secure and Efficient Data Sharing Scheme with Outsourced Signcryption and Decryption in Mobile Cloud Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Access control","Performance evaluation","Cloud computing","Costs","Conferences","Mobile handsets","Data models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["access control","signcryption","mobile cloud","digital signing","CP-ABE"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"A Secure and Efficient Data Sharing Scheme with Outsourced Signcryption and Decryption in Mobile Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9566205/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2021","conferenceDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Secure and Efficient Data Sharing Scheme with Outsourced Signcryption and Decryption in Mobile Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Oxford, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"347900a072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076889S","chronDate":"23-26 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9566158","isNumber":"9566161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9566158","xplore-issue":"9566161","articleId":"9566205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9566216,"authors":[{"name":"Vasileios Christou","affiliation":["University of Ioannina, Arta, Greece"],"firstName":"Vasileios","lastName":"Christou","id":"37088463454"},{"name":"Alexandros Arjmand","affiliation":["University of Ioannina, Arta, Greece"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Arjmand","id":"37086919255"},{"name":"Dimitrios Dimopoulos","affiliation":["University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Dimopoulos","id":"37085380532"},{"name":"Dimitrios Varvarousis","affiliation":["University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Varvarousis","id":"37088996318"},{"name":"Alexandros T.

The proposed system is tested using a custom-created dataset containing 10 healthy and 20 patients suffering from hemiplegia (right or left). The experimental part of the system utilized 7 sensors placed on the left and right foot, the left and right shank, the left and right thigh, and the hip of each subject. Each sensor captured a 3-dimensional (3D) signal from 3 different device types: accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope. The system utilized and split into 2-second windows only the accelerometer data, achieving a classification accuracy of 87.71%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566216/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9566216/","publicationDate":"24 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network-Based approach for Hemiplegia Detection via Accelerometer Signals","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Union"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008530","fundingName":"European Regional Development Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network-Based approach for Hemiplegia Detection via Accelerometer Signals","confLoc":"Preveza, Greece","sourcePdf":"paper_60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085838S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565881","isNumber":"9565882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565881","xplore-issue":"9565882","articleId":"9566216","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":9566231,"authors":[{"name":"Georgia Foutsitzi","affiliation":["University of Ioannina, Arta, Greece"],"firstName":"Georgia","lastName":"Foutsitzi","id":"37087940204"},{"name":"Christos Gogos","affiliation":["University of Ioannina, Arta, Greece"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Gogos","id":"37298789200"},{"name":"Aris Magklaras","affiliation":["University of Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Aris","lastName":"Magklaras","id":"37088570724"},{"name":"Nikolaos Antoniadis","affiliation":["University of Ioannina, Arta, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Antoniadis","id":"37089001846"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2742-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-2743-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9566231","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":26},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Piezoelectric materials","Aluminum","Pareto optimization","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Generators","Finite element analysis","Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566231","abstract":"In this work, the optimal design of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wing spar by multi-objective optimization genetic algorithms is studied. An electromechanical finite element model (FEM) for piezolaminated bimorph cantilever structure with embedded piezoceramics is used combined with multiobjective genetic algorithms. The FEM formulation is based on laminated plate theory combined with the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) for which each piezoelectric layer has one additional electrical degree of freedom. Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III) and Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (GDE3) algorithm have been used to optimize the geometric and electric circuit parameters of a UAV generator for maximum power output and minimum mass added by the embedded piezoceramics. It is shown that the proposed algorithms are effective in developing optimal Pareto front curves for maximum electrical power output of the generator spar and minimum mass add by the embedded piezoceramics. Comparison of the generated solutions on the Pareto Front for UAV wing spar design shows that all three algorithms achieve solutions that closely resemble a constructed reference Pareto optimal front.","doi":"10.1109/SEEDA-CECNSM53056.2021.9566231","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 6th South-East Europe Design Automation, Computer Engineering, Computer Networks and Social Media Conference (SEEDA-CECNSM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEEDA-CECNSM53056.2021.9566231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9565882","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th South-East Europe Design Automation, Computer Engineering, Computer Networks and Social Media Conference (SEEDA-CECNSM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9565881/9565882/09566231.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Objective Design Optimization of Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566231/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Design Optimization of Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9566231/","publicationDate":"24 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2021","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Design Optimization of Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","confLoc":"Preveza, Greece","sourcePdf":"paper_85.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053275S","chronDate":"24-26 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9565881","isNumber":"9565882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9565881","xplore-issue":"9565882","articleId":"9566231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":9566340,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanouil Andrianakis","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Emmanouil","lastName":"Andrianakis"},{"name":"Georgios Vougioukas","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Vougioukas"},{"name":"Evangelos Giannelos","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Evangelos","lastName":"Giannelos"},{"name":"Orestis Giannakopoulos","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Orestis","lastName":"Giannakopoulos"},{"name":"Georgios Apostolakis","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Apostolakis"},{"name":"Konstantinos Skyvalakis","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Skyvalakis"},{"name":"Aggelos Bletsas","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Aggelos","lastName":"Bletsas"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-290-112-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4202-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9566340","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566340","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Soil measurements","Soil moisture","Lighting","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Safety","MONOS devices"]}],"abstract":"Due to its ultra-low-power and low-complexity character, backscatter radio technology has been recently employed in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This work puts forth experimental study on drone (UAV)-based interrogation of a backscatter environmental WSN; the latter can measure various environmental attributes (e.g., soil moisture), assisting the farmers towards more productive and greener operation. Three backscatter radio architectures are experimentally compared: a) monostatic, where a single embedded software-defined radio (SDR) is used for illuminating the sensors, receiving and decoding the sensor-backscattered signal, b) bistatic illumination from a drone and c) bistatic illumination from a pedestrian; in the latter two architectures, a remote SDR received and processed the sensor-backscattered signals. For the specific small-scale sensor deployment, it was surprisingly found that the bistatic pedestrian illumination was roughly twice as effective compared to the bistatic drone illumination, which was again twice as effective compared to the mono static drone illumination. Safety issues relevant to low-altitude flights in the monostatic architecture were also raised. Future work will focus on larger-scale backscatter sensor deployments.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9566321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SpliTech52315.2021.9566340","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9566320/9566321/09566340.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.23919/SpliTech52315.2021.9566340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Drone Interrogation (and its Low-Cost Alternative) in Backscatter Environmental Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Drone Interrogation (and its Low-Cost Alternative) in Backscatter Environmental Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9566340/","publicationDate":"8 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566340/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Drone Interrogation (and its Low-Cost Alternative) in Backscatter Environmental Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Bol and Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057257S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9566320","isNumber":"9566321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9566320","xplore-issue":"9566321","articleId":"9566340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9566357,"authors":[{"name":"Nils Jakob Johannesen","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Agder, Kristiansand, Norway"],"firstName":"Nils Jakob","lastName":"Johannesen"},{"name":"Mohan Lal Kolhe","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Agder, Kristiansand, Norway"],"firstName":"Mohan Lal","lastName":"Kolhe"},{"name":"Morten Goodwin","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Agder, Kristiansand, Norway"],"firstName":"Morten","lastName":"Goodwin"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-290-112-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4202-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9566357","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566357","abstract":"Electrical demand forecasting is essential for power generation capacity planning and integrating environment-friendly energy sources. In addition, load predictions will help in developing demand-side management in coordination with renewable power generation. Meteorological conditions influence urban area load pattern; therefore, it is vital to include weather parameters for load predictions. Machine Learning algorithms can effectively be used for electrical load predictions considering impact of external parameters. This paper explores and compares the basic Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN); Simple Recurrent Neural Networks (Vanilla RNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). Vanilla RNNs are fully connected neural networks where the output from the previous time step is being fed to the next time step. GRUs are networks with a gating mechanism: a forget gate. LSTM networks also, in addition to a forget gate, include an output gate. Even though the recurrent structure in itself is robust for efficient forecasting, pre-processing of data (including load, weather) is important to enhance the performance. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces and extracts the main components of available data. This work shows that PCA improves the performance of RNNs with use of weather parameters. The historical electrical load dataset from Sydney region is used to test the load forecasting using these techniques considering meteorological parameters. Through load forecasting, it is observed that for the 30 minutes predictions, GRU trained with a reduced number of principal components performs best for a typical period with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.74%.","doi":"10.23919/SpliTech52315.2021.9566357","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9566320/9566321/09566357.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SpliTech52315.2021.9566357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9566321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing Recurrent Neural Networks using Principal Component Analysis for Electrical Load Predictions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Renewable energy sources","Recurrent neural networks","Load forecasting","Urban areas","Demand forecasting","Logic gates","Reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["load forecasting","principal component analysis","smart grid","load time series","recurrent neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566357/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Comparing Recurrent Neural Networks using Principal Component Analysis for Electrical Load Predictions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9566357/","publicationDate":"8 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing Recurrent Neural Networks using Principal Component Analysis for Electrical Load Predictions","confLoc":"Bol and Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062944S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9566320","isNumber":"9566321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9566320","xplore-issue":"9566321","articleId":"9566357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":9566383,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelrahman S.

In general, resource management is an important issue in cellular networks that can highly effect their performance. In this paper, an optimisation problem is formulated to assign each user to an optimal access point and a wavelength at a given time. This problem can be solved using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). However, using MILP is not considered a practical solution due to its complexity and memory requirements. In addition, accurate information must be provided to perform the resource allocation. Therefore, the optimisation problem is reformulated using reinforcement learning (RL), which has recently received tremendous interest due to its ability to interact with any environment without prior knowledge. In this paper, the resource allocation optimisation problem in VLC systems is investigated using the basic Q-learning algorithm. Two scenarios are simulated to compare the results with the previously proposed MILP model. The results demonstrate the ability of the Q-learning algorithm to provide optimal solutions close to the MILP model without prior knowledge of the system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Q-learning algorithm for resource allocation in WDMA-based optical wireless communication networks","publicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech)","doi":"10.23919/SpliTech52315.2021.9566383","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 6th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies (SpliTech)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9566320/9566321/09566383.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/SpliTech52315.2021.9566383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9566321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566383","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Q-learning algorithm for resource allocation in WDMA-based optical wireless communication networks","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9566383/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","publicationDate":"8 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)","grantNumber":"EP/H040536/1,EP/K016873/1,EP/S016570/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Q-learning algorithm for resource allocation in WDMA-based optical wireless communication networks","confLoc":"Bol and Split, Croatia","sourcePdf":"26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087645S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9566320","isNumber":"9566321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9566320","xplore-issue":"9566321","articleId":"9566383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9566406,"authors":[{"name":"Rao Muhammad Umer","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science University of Udine,Udine,Italy"],"firstName":"Rao Muhammad","lastName":"Umer"},{"name":"Asad Munir","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science University of Udine,Udine,Italy"],"firstName":"Asad","lastName":"Munir"},{"name":"Christian Micheloni","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science University of Udine,Udine,Italy"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Micheloni"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-290-112-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4202-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"9566406","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":15},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566406","abstract":"Recently, most of state-of-the-art single image super-resolution (SISR) methods have attained impressive performance by using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). The existing SR methods have limited performance due to a fixed degradation settings, i.e. usually a bicubic downscaling of low-resolution (LR) image. However, in real-world settings, the LR degradation process is unknown which can be bicubic LR, bilinear LR, nearest-neighbor LR, or real LR. Therefore, most SR methods are ineffective and inefficient in handling more than one degradation settings within a single network.

What we are now witnessing is an undoubted change of trend towards a decentralized and decarbonized electric grid, where the electric generation based on local resources will take on special relevance. In this context, the encouragement of collective self-consumption becomes one of the key issues when it comes to taking steps forward to this end. One of the aspects that will contribute to this aim is the development of a consumption-forecasting tool. Hence, a load-forecasting model based on NARX Neural Network is proposed in the following paper. The prediction of the next day (24h) load profile of an individual building is carried out aiming an optimal management of the flexible loads so to achieve the maximum self-consumption. To ensure a consistent behavior of the NARX Neural Network model, identification and removing of outliers, together with data normalization and fixing common time interval has been carried out.

Essentially different from most current literature, a novel switching law is developed to depict the dynamic behavior of switched memristive neural networks, in which the sojourn probabilities of each subsystem are assumed to be nonhomogeneous, and a higher-level deterministic switching signal is proposed to regulate proper feedback switching information by means of the average dwell time approach. Meanwhile, to alleviate the constraint network bandwidth resource efficiently, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism with a novel threshold parameter is proposed in determining if the current data should be released or not. By resorting to the Lyapunov functional technique and the stochastic analysis strategy, some sufficient conditions are addressed to ensure the stochastic stability of the augmented switched memristive neural networks. In the end, the effectiveness and superiority of the developed results are verified by a numerical example.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2021.3117694","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/9629436/09566479.pdf","startPage":"4924","endPage":"4934","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9629436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2021.3117694","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566479/","displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Event-Triggered Approach to State Estimation for Switched Memristive Neural Networks With Nonhomogeneous Sojourn Probabilities","volume":"68","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9566479/","dateOfInsertion":"30 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"12161011 and 62173100"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004607","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province","grantNumber":"2020GXNSFAA159049 and 2020GXNSFFA297003"},{"fundingName":"Guangxi Science and Technology Base and Specialized Talents","grantNumber":"Guike AD20159057"},{"fundingName":"Training Program for 1000 Young and Middle-Aged Cadre Teachers in Universities of Guangxi Province"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant by the Korean Government (Ministry of Science and ICT)","grantNumber":"2019R1A5A8080290"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Event-Triggered Approach to State Estimation for Switched Memristive Neural Networks With Nonhomogeneous Sojourn Probabilities","sourcePdf":"tcsi-cheng-3117694-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106438S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"9629436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","xplore-issue":"9629436","articleId":"9566479","onlineDate":"11 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9566506,"authors":[{"name":"Bon-Hong Koo","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Bon-Hong Koo is currently a Ph.D. student in the School of Integrated Technology, Yonsei University, Korea.

Because conventional wireless communication technologies face challenges in realizing new applications (e.g., in-body area networks for health monitoring) and necessitate the substitution of information carriers, researchers have shifted their interest to molecular communications (MC). Although remarkable progress has been made in this field over the last decade, advances have been far from acceptable for the achievement of its application objectives. A crucial problem of MC is the low data rate and high error rate inherent in particle dynamics specifications, in contrast to wave-based conventional communications. Therefore, it is important to investigate the resources by which MC can obtain additional information paths and provide strategies to exploit these resources. This study aims to examine techniques involving resource aggregation and exploitation to provide prospective directions for future progress in MC. In particular, we focus on state-of-the-art studies on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We discuss the possible advantages of applying MIMO to various MC system models. Furthermore, we survey various studies that aimed to achieve MIMO gains for the respective models, from theoretical background to prototypes. Finally, we conclude this study by summarizing the challenges that need to be addressed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Operations in Molecular Communications: Theory, Prototypes, and Open Challenges","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.110.2000984","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/9566482/09566506.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.110.2000984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9566482","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566506/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2021","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Operations in Molecular Communications: Theory, Prototypes, and Open Challenges","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9566506/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","publicationDate":"September 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Operations in Molecular Communications: Theory, Prototypes, and Open Challenges","sourcePdf":"029CHAE_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037806S","chronDate":"September  2021","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"9566482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","xplore-issue":"9566482","articleId":"9566506","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9566518,"authors":[{"name":"Pai Chet Ng","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Pai Chet Ng obtained her Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

To date, more than 100 contact tracing applications have been published to slow down the spread of highly contagious Covid-19. Despite subtle variabilities among these applications, all of them achieve contact tracing by manipulating the following three components: use of a personal device to identify the user while designing a secure protocol to anonymize the user's identity; leverage networking technologies to analyze and store the data; and exploit rich sensing features on the user device to detect the interaction among users and thus estimate the exposure risk. This article reviews the current digital contact tracing based on these three components. We focus on two personal devices that are intimate to the user: smartphones and wearables. We discuss the centralized and decentralized networking approaches that are used to facilitate the data flow. Lastly, we investigate the sensing feature available on smartphones and wearables to detect the proximity between any two users and present experiments comparing the proximity sensing performance between these two personal devices.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.001.2100002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/9566482/09566518.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.001.2100002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9566482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personal Devices for Contact Tracing: Smartphones and Wearables to Fight Covid-19","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566518/","displayDocTitle":"Personal Devices for Contact Tracing: Smartphones and Wearables to Fight Covid-19","volume":"59","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2021","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9566518/","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personal Devices for Contact Tracing: Smartphones and Wearables to Fight Covid-19","sourcePdf":"014SPACHOS_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039254S","chronDate":"September  2021","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"9566482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","xplore-issue":"9566482","articleId":"9566518","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9566567,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Soldi","affiliation":["NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE), Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Giovanni Soldi is a scientist at CMRE.

In many countries, drastic restrictive measures adopted by political authorities, such as national lockdowns, have not prevented the outbreak of the new pandemic's waves. In this article, we propose an integrated detection-estimation-forecasting framework that, using publicly available data, is designed to: learn relevant features of the pandemic (e.g., the infection rate); detect as quickly as possible the onset (or the termination) of an exponential growth of the contagion; and reliably forecast the pandemic evolution. The proposed solution is validated by analyzing the COVID-19 second and third waves in the United States.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/9566482/09566567.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"22","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.101.2001252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.101.2001252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9566482","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quickest Detection and Forecast of Pandemic Outbreaks: Analysis of COVID-19 Waves","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["COVID-19","Pandemics","Human factors","Predictive models","Signal processing","Reliability engineering","Social factors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566567/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Quickest Detection and Forecast of Pandemic Outbreaks: Analysis of COVID-19 Waves","volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9566567/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2021","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"AFOSR","grantNumber":"FA9500-18-1-0463"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quickest Detection and Forecast of Pandemic Outbreaks: Analysis of COVID-19 Waves","sourcePdf":"012GAGLIONE_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048711S","chronDate":"September  2021","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"9566482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","xplore-issue":"9566482","articleId":"9566567","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":9566601,"authors":[{"name":"Shaoshuai Fan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9566601/fan-3119072-small.gif","p":["Shaoshuai Fan (Member, IEEE) received the M.S. degree in information and communication engineering from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information system from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2015.","From 2015 to 2017, he was a Post-Doctoral Researcher with BUPT, where he is currently a Lecturer.

A carrier-phase based clock offset estimation method is first proposed to achieve precise clock synchronization among base stations, and proved to achieve the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) asymptotically. A fusion method is developed to fuse the estimated positions of a mobile station (MS) based on time-difference-of-arrival, with the estimated position changes based on the temporal changes of carrier phase measurements. While circumventing the integer ambiguities of the carrier phase measurements, the fusion method provides quality interim estimates of the MS positions, at which the measurements can be linearized to resolve the integer ambiguities. As a result, precise MS positions can be obtained based on the disambiguated carrier phase measurements. Numerical simulations show that the proposed carrier phase positioning can achieve a centimeter-level accuracy in wireless cellular networks.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119072","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09566601.pdf","startPage":"564","endPage":"577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Carrier Phase-Based Synchronization and High-Accuracy Positioning in 5G New Radio Cellular Networks","volume":"70","issue":"1","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9566601/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566601/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61801044"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Univ. of Posts and Telecommun.-China Mobile Research Institute Joint Innovation Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Carrier Phase-Based Synchronization and High-Accuracy Positioning in 5G New Radio Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-fan-3119072-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129668S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9566601","onlineDate":"11 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9566708,"authors":[{"name":"Anton Kovalyov","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Anton","lastName":"Kovalyov","orcid":"0000-0003-4128-4620","id":"37088634772"},{"name":"Kashyap Patel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kashyap","lastName":"Patel","id":"37088476340"},{"name":"Issa Panahi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Issa","lastName":"Panahi","orcid":"0000-0002-1852-3104","id":"37301126200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2644-1322"}],"articleNumber":"9566708","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Loudspeakers","Calibration","Synchronization","Microphone arrays","Three-dimensional displays","Geometry","Acoustic arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microphone array","calibration","localization","synchronization","PSO"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566708","abstract":"This work presents a methodology for the joint calibration and synchronization of two arrays of microphones and loudspeakers. The problem is modeled as estimation of the rigid motion of one array with respect to the other, as well as estimation of the synchronization mismatch between the two. The proposed method uses dedicated signals emitted by the loudspeakers of the two arrays to compute a set of time of arrival (TOA) estimates. Through a simple transformation, estimated TOAs are converted into a set of linearly independent time difference of arrival (TDOA) measurements, which are modeled by a system of nonlinear equations in the unknown parameters of interest. A maximum likelihood estimate is then given as the solution to a nonlinear weighted least squares (NWLS) problem, which is optimized applying a parallelizable variant of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In this paper, we also derive the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB), and benchmark it against the proposed method in a series of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

To improve the reliability of the clustering information obtained by the model, we propose a biclustering collaborative learning (BCL) framework derived from an identity disentanglement adaptation network (IDA-Net). IDA-Net encodes the identity and style of the input image and transfers the style on the premise of maintaining identity consistency. By comparing the clustering results obtained on the same dataset before and after the transfer process, BCL can select hard samples with higher confidence for model optimization. In each iteration, we design a conditional batch hard triplet loss to optimize the two networks. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets (Maket1501, DukeMTMC-reID and MSMT17) demonstrate the superior performance of BCL over the state-of-the-art methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09566733.pdf","startPage":"2142","endPage":"2146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3119208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3119208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biclustering Collaborative Learning for Cross-Domain Person Re-Identification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Feature extraction","Collaborative work","Sun","Image coding","Generators","Forestry"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Person re-identification","unsupervised learning","domain adaptation","clustering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Biclustering Collaborative Learning for Cross-Domain Person Re-Identification","volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9566733/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2572019BH03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005046","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province","grantNumber":"LH2019C003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biclustering Collaborative Learning for Cross-Domain Person Re-Identification","sourcePdf":"lsp-guo-3119208-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070071S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9566733","onlineDate":"11 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9566776,"authors":[{"name":"Yawogan Jean Eudes Gbodjo","affiliation":["TETIS Research Unit, National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/9314330/9566776/eudes-3119191-small.gif","p":["Yawogan Jean Eudes Gbodjo received the M.Sc. degree in geomatics from the University of Jean Jaures, Toulouse, France, in 2018.

In order to make a step further with respect to previous studies, which investigate multitemporal SAR and optical data or multitemporal/multiscale optical combinations, here, we propose a deep learning framework that simultaneously integrates all these input sources, specifically multitemporal SAR/optical data and fine-scale optical information at their native temporal and spatial resolutions. Our proposal relies on a patch-based multibranch convolutional neural network (CNN) that exploits different per-source encoders to deal with the specificity of the input signals. In addition, we introduce a new self-distillation strategy to boost the per-source analyses and exploit the interplay among the different input sources.

The rapidly growing utility and popularity of point cloud processing strongly motivate a plethora of research activities on large-scale point cloud processing and feature extraction. In this work, we investigate point cloud resampling based on hypergraph signal processing (HGSP). We develop a novel method to extract sharp object features and reduce the data size of point cloud representation. By directly estimating hypergraph spectrum based on hypergraph stationary processing, we design a spectral kernel-based filter to capture high-dimensional interactions among point signal nodes and to better preserve object surface outlines. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of hypergraph in representing point clouds, and demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm under noise.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Point Cloud Resampling via Hypergraph Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3119257","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09566809.pdf","startPage":"2117","endPage":"2121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3119257","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566809/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Point Cloud Resampling via Hypergraph Signal Processing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9566809/","dateOfInsertion":"02 November 2021","publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2029848 and 2002937"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Point Cloud Resampling via Hypergraph Signal Processing","sourcePdf":"lsp-ding-3119257-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056062S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9566809","onlineDate":"11 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9566812,"authors":[{"name":"Yansheng Qiu","affiliation":["National Engineering Research Center for Multimedia Software, School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yansheng","lastName":"Qiu","orcid":"0000-0002-5619-0902"},{"name":"Jun Chen","affiliation":["National Engineering Research Center for Multimedia Software, School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0003-1376-0167"},{"name":"Zheng Wang","affiliation":["National Engineering Research Center for Multimedia Software, School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-3846-9157"},{"name":"Xiao Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0003-0770-9891"},{"name":"Chia-Wen Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Wen","lastName":"Lin","orcid":"0000-0002-9097-2318"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"9566812","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"abstract":"Low-light image enhancement aims to improve an image's visual quality, which is essential for many downstream computer vision and multimedia tasks. Existing spatial-domain enhancement methods barely focus on the regions containing object boundaries, which take the most informative characteristics. However, solely focusing on enhancing high-frequency details not only causes over-sharpening of an image but also leads to color distortion. In this letter, we propose a novel spatio-spectral feature fusion network (S2F2N), that involves a frequency-feature representation branch (FRB) and a spatial-feature representation branch (SRB) to learn the domain-specific representation individually. Moreover, a spatial-channel mixed attention block (MAB) is introduced to learn the joint representation of spatio-spectral features for final image relighting. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can produce high fidelity results for low-light images.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatio-Spectral Feature Fusion for Low-Light Image Enhancement","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2021.3118640","endPage":"2161","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/9325893/09566812.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","startPage":"2157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2021.3118640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9325893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566812","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency-domain analysis","Convolution","Image enhancement","Discrete wavelet transforms","Training","Image color analysis","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet","low-light enhancement","spatio-spectral fusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatio-Spectral Feature Fusion for Low-Light Image Enhancement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9566812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","volume":"28","htmlLink":"/document/9566812/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62071338, 61801335 and 61862015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatio-Spectral Feature Fusion for Low-Light Image Enhancement","sourcePdf":"lsp-qiu-3118640-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065609S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"9325893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","xplore-issue":"9325893","articleId":"9566812","onlineDate":"11 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":9566874,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Shehata","affiliation":["Terahertz Engineering Laboratory, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Shehata","id":"37086058286"},{"name":"Ke Wang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Wang","id":"37088466338"},{"name":"Julian Webber","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Webber","id":"37085361339"},{"name":"Masayuki Fujita","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Fujita","id":"37276710800"},{"name":"Tadao Nagatsuma","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadao","lastName":"Nagatsuma","id":"37271290400"},{"name":"Withawat Withayachumnankul","affiliation":["Terahertz Engineering Laboratory, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Withawat","lastName":"Withayachumnankul","id":"38561150200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9424-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-9425-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2035"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2162-2027"}],"articleNumber":"9566874","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE 802.15 Standard","Shape","Spectral efficiency","Conferences","Bit error rate","Standards"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.15.3d Standard","pulse shaping","terahertz communications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9566874","doi":"10.1109/IRMMW-THz50926.2021.9566874","publicationTitle":"2021 46th International Conference on Infrared, Millimeter and Terahertz Waves (IRMMW-THz)","abstract":"We propose a pulse shape design that fully complies with the spectral emission requirements of the IEEE 802.15.3d Standard.

In the first concept, we use amplitude and phase levels to form a simple MDS code, whereas, in the second one, in-phase and quadrature components of codeword elements are used to construct the MDS code. We depict practical schemes for using the proposed concepts with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). We analyze the performance in terms of the minimum Euclidean distance and bit error rate. We also show that the proposed techniques exhibit desirable properties such as efficient low-complexity detection, very simple bits-to-symbols, and symbols-to-bits mappings, and a better error performance when compared to the OFDM-IM and related schemes. More importantly, contrary to the vast majority of IM studies that focus on showing the superiority of the IM techniques against conventional modulation techniques, we show that modulation concepts based on a well-known MDS code can achieve better error performance than the IM and related schemes while exhibiting a structure as simple as these schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"118","endPage":"131","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09567657.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9567657","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Codes","OFDM","Indexes","Encoding","Complexity theory","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum distance separable (MDS) code","modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modulation Based on a Simple MDS Code: Achieving Better Error Performance Than Index Modulation and Related Schemes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9567657/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9567657/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Bristol Innovation and Research Laboratory of Toshiba Research Europe Ltd."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation Based on a Simple MDS Code: Achieving Better Error Performance Than Index Modulation and Related Schemes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yarkin-3119365-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088797S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9567657","onlineDate":"11 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9567658,"authors":[{"name":"Limei Hu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Limei","lastName":"Hu","orcid":"0000-0001-8899-0771"},{"name":"Zhengchuan Chen","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengchuan","lastName":"Chen","orcid":"0000-0002-2289-5621"},{"name":"Yunjian Jia","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Yunjian","lastName":"Jia"},{"name":"Min Wang","affiliation":["School of Optoelectronics Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0001-7838-8947"},{"name":"Tony Q.

We formulate a optimisation framework in terms of UAVs\u2019 deployment, power allocation at MBS, phase-shift of RIS, and blocklength of URLLC.

We reveal that the key to showing this non-universality result is determined by the stability of the underlying codes. More concretely, for an ordered and complete channel family and a sequence of low-density parity-check code ensembles, we determine a stability threshold associated with them, which gives rise to a sufficient condition under which the sequence is not universal under belief propagation decoding. Moreover, we show that the same stability threshold applies to blockwise or bitwise maximum \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a posteriori</i>\n decoding as well.

A practical system model that takes into account the presence of phase error due to quantization at the IRS when a) source-destination (SD) link is present and b) SD link is absent is considered. First, an exact expression is derived, and then we derive three simple approximations for the OP using the following approaches: (i) uni-variate dimension reduction, (ii) moment matching and, (iii) Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence minimization. The resulting expressions for OP are simple to evaluate and quite tight even in the tail region. The validity of these approximations is demonstrated using extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We also study the impact of the number of bits available for quantization, the position of IRS with respect to the source and destination and the number of IRS elements on the OP for systems with and without an SD link. We also demonstrate how the method of moment matching and KL divergence minimization can be used to analyze systems experiencing spatial correlation between the IRS elements.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119357","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09567678.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Outage Probability Expressions for an IRS-Assisted System With and Without Source-Destination Link for the Case of Quantized Phase Shifts in <i>\u03ba \u2013 \u03bc</i> Fading","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9567678/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9567678/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Probability Expressions for an IRS-Assisted System With and Without Source-Destination Link for the Case of Quantized Phase Shifts in <italic>\u03ba \u2013 \u03bc</italic> Fading","sourcePdf":"tcomm-subhash-3119357-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127558S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9567678","onlineDate":"11 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9567679,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, the spatial ordering of skeletal joints during the entire action recognition lifecycle is found to be fixed across datasets and frameworks. Intuition inspired us to investigate through experimentation, the influence of multiple random skeletal joint ordered features on the performance of deep learning systems. Therefore, the argument: can joint order independent learning for skeletal action recognition practicable? If practicable, the goal is to discover how many different types of randomly ordered joint feature representations are sufficient for training deep networks. Implicitly, we further investigated on multiple features and deep networks that recorded highest performance on jumbled joints. This work proposes a novel idea of learning skeletal joint volumetric features on a spectrally graded CNN to achieve joint order independence. Intuitively, we propose 4 joint features called as quad joint volumetric features (QJVF), which are found to offer better spatio temporal relationships between time series joint data when compared to existing features. Consequently, we propose a Spectrally graded Convolutional Neural Network (SgCNN) to characterize spatially divergent features extracted from jumbled skeletal joints. Finally, evaluation of the proposed hypothesis has been experimented on our 3D skeletal action KLHA3D102, KLYOGA3D datasets along with benchmarks, HDM05, CMU and NTU RGB D. The results demonstrated that the joint order independent feature learning is achievable on CNNs trained on quantified spatio temporal feature maps extracted from randomly shuffled skeletal joints from action sequences.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119455","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09567679.pdf","startPage":"139611","endPage":"139626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9567679/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Can Skeletal Joint Positional Ordering Influence Action Recognition on Spectrally Graded CNNs: A Perspective on Achieving Joint Order Independent Learning","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9567679/","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"research project scheme titled \u201cVisual\u2013Verbal Machine Interpreter Fostering Hearing Impaired and Elderly\u201d through the \u201cTechnology Interventions for Disabled and Elderly\u201d Program, SEED Division, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"SEED/TIDE/013/2014(G)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Can Skeletal Joint Positional Ordering Influence Action Recognition on Spectrally Graded CNNs: A Perspective on Achieving Joint Order Independent Learning","sourcePdf":"access-kishore-3119455-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167688S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9567679","onlineDate":"11 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9567688,"authors":[{"name":"Ngo Tan Vu Khanh","affiliation":["School of Business Information Technology, University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9567688/khanh-3119318-small.gif","p":["Ngo Tan Vu Khanh received the B.A. degree in information technology from the Ho Chi Minh City University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in 2004, the M.S. degree in computer information system technology from the Asia Institute of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in management information system from Soongsil University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2014.","In 2009, he was the Vice Head of the Software Technology Department, Ti\u00ean Giang University.

The secondary system consists of a secondary transmitter (ST) and multiple secondary users, which are allowed to access the same spectrum of licensed users (i.e., the primary system). Adopting linear beamforming at ST, we formulate the optimization problem of the energy-efficient maximization for the secondary system under the power constraint at ST and interference power constraints at primary receivers. In the short blocklength regime, the rate function is more complex and computationally intractable than the traditional Shannon rate function, which makes the formulated problem more difficult to solve. By leveraging techniques from the Dinkelbach method and the inner approximation method, we first devise newly approximated functions to convexify nonconvex constraints, and the iterative algorithm is then developed to obtain at least a locally optimal solution. To further enhance the energy efficiency of the secondary system, we consider a joint optimization of beamforming and antenna selection at ST, where binary variables are introduced to establish the operation modes of transmit antennas. To solve the mixed-integer nonconvex problem, we incorporate the penalty function into the objective function to dealing with the uncertainty of binary variables. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the fast convergence and merits of the proposed algorithms, as well as to confirm the role of antenna selection in improving energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119318","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09567688.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119318","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"144676","endPage":"144686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Design of Beamforming and Antenna Selection in Short Blocklength Regime for URLLC in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9567688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Joint Design of Beamforming and Antenna Selection in Short Blocklength Regime for URLLC in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9567688/","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9567688/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004692","fundingName":"University of Economics Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Design of Beamforming and Antenna Selection in Short Blocklength Regime for URLLC in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"access-khanh-3119318-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082297S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9567688","onlineDate":"11 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBYNCND","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9567692,"authors":[{"name":"Khubaib Ahmed Qureshi","affiliation":["DHA Suffa University, Karachi, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9567692/qures-3119404-small.gif","p":["Khubaib Ahmed Qureshi is currently affiliated with the Department of Computer Science, DHA Suffa University, Karachi, Pakistan, as an Assistant Professor, and the Head of the Data Science Program.

It puts a tremendous strain on society by damaging reputation, public trust, freedom of expression, journalism, justice, truth, and democracy. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to detect and contain unreliable information. Multiple techniques have been proposed to detect fake news propagation in tweets based on tweets content, propagation on the network of users, and the profile of the news generators. Generating human-like content allows deceiving content-based methods. Network-based methods rely on the complete graph to detect fake news, resulting in late detection. User profile-based techniques are effective for bots or fake accounts detection. However, they are not suited to detect fake news from original accounts. To deal with the shortcomings in existing methods, we introduce a source-based method focusing on the news propagators\u2019 community, including posters and re-tweeters to detect such contents. Propagators are connected using follower-following relations. A feature set combining the connectivity patterns of news propagators with their profile features is used in a machine learning framework to perform binary classification of tweets. Complex network measures and user profile features are also examined separately. We perform an extensive comparative analysis of the proposed methodology on a real-world COVID-19 dataset, exploiting various machine learning and deep learning models at the community and node levels. Results show that hybrid features perform better than network features and user features alone. Further optimization demonstrates that Ensemble\u2019s boosting model CATBoost and deep learning model RNN are the most effective, with an AUC score of 98%. Furthermore, preliminary results show that the proposed solution can also handle fake news in the political and entertainment domain using a small training set.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09567692.pdf","startPage":"139636","endPage":"139656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex Network and Source Inspired COVID-19 Fake News Classification on Twitter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9567692","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9567692/","displayDocTitle":"Complex Network and Source Inspired COVID-19 Fake News Classification on Twitter","volume":"9","publicationDate":"2021","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9567692/","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Complex Network and Source Inspired COVID-19 Fake News Classification on Twitter","sourcePdf":"access-qureshi-3119404-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152259S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9567692","onlineDate":"11 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-25"},{"_id":9567703,"authors":[{"name":"Pavel Panteleev","affiliation":["Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia"],"bio":{"p":["Pavel Panteleev received the M.S. degree in computer science from Moscow State Aviation Technological University in 2001 and the Ph.D. (Candidate of Science) degree in mathematics from Moscow State University in 2006.

Nevertheless, the 6G design process is at its preliminary stages. The reality today is that hardware, technologies and new materials required to effectively meet the unprecedented performance targets required for future 6G services and network operation, have not been designed, tested or even do not exist yet. Today, a solid vision on the cost-benefit trade-offs of machine learning and artificial intelligence support for 6G network and services operation optimization is missing. This includes the possible support from hardware efficiency, operation effectiveness and, the immeasurable cost due to data acquisition-transfer-processing. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. This is the first paper deriving crucial 6G key performance indicators on hardware and technology design. Second, we present a new hardware technologies design methodology conceived to enable the effective software-hardware components integration required to meet the challenging performance envisioned for future 6G networks. Third, we suggest a paradigm shift towards goal-oriented and semantic communications, in which a totally new opportunity of joint design of hardware, artificial intelligence and effective communication is offered. The proposed vision is consolidated by our recent results on hardware, technology and machine learning performance.","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC53450.2021.9567793","publicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2021 - IEEE 47th European Solid State Circuits Conference (ESSCIRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSCIRC 2021 - IEEE 47th European Solid State Circuits Conference (ESSCIRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9567713/9567736/09567793.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC53450.2021.9567793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9567736","startPage":"275","endPage":"282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward 6G: From New Hardware Design to Wireless Semantic and Goal-Oriented Communication Paradigms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9567793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Toward 6G: From New Hardware Design to Wireless Semantic and Goal-Oriented Communication Paradigms","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-22 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9567793/","conferenceDate":"13-22 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9567793/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward 6G: From New Hardware Design to Wireless Semantic and Goal-Oriented Communication Paradigms","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"C064-D1L-2-1-9319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058262S","chronDate":"13-22 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9567713","isNumber":"9567736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9567713","xplore-issue":"9567736","articleId":"9567793","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9567798,"authors":[{"name":"Sangyeop Lee","affiliation":["Grad.

All resistors are implemented as multielement pseudo-resistors, which feature high linearity, robustness against process and temperature variations, and a very wide tuning range of more than five decades. While state-of-the-art TIAs are mainly implemented with either resistive or capacitive feedback, the proposed TIA uses a capacitive-resistive feedback network to combine the best of both topologies. The TIA features a noise floor of 0.6 fA/\u2713Hz at its maximum transimpedance of 150 G\u03a9 and a bandwidth of 2.9 MHz at its minimum transimpedance of 440 k\u03a9. A subsequent inverting amplifier stage provides an optional pole-zero compensation to extend the TIA's overall bandwidth by a factor of up to 180 or with an absolute limit of 2.3 MHz. An additional dc servo loop, which incorporates a tunable integrator and a tunable dc feedback resistor, can be used to prevent large dc currents from flowing through the main signal path. Its dc transimpedance can be adjusted separately from the ac transimpedance, and the crossover frequency is adjustable over a range of more than five decades.

In this work, two array elements are combined in two cascaded stages for extremely wideband operation. Combined load resonances are distributed and adjusted appropriately in each of the combining stages to achieve a flat response over the band of 38.5-60.5GHz.

Furthermore, to make it fast, we change the algorithm to process asynchronously. Before this, the AAD algorithm works in offline and worked in synchronous processing. Although AAD was altered to receive online data from IoT devices, the algorithm performance is still slow.

In this paper, the entropy generation is used to quantify the energy dissipation, which is regarded as one of the main performance characteristics of LED's degradation process. Considering the thermodynamic characteristics of entropy generation in the LED failure, a hybrid degradation prediction model based on the permutation entropy (PE) and data-driven methods was proposed. Firstly, a thermal aging test was designed for white LEDs in which the entropy generation rates (EGRs) of LEDs were extracted from the online collected thermoelectric performance parameters. Then, the EGRs of LEDs were treated as a time-series signal to perform phase space reconstruction and calculate PEs. Finally, both neural network model and Wiener process based data-driven methods were used to process the PEs. This hybrid model links the thermodynamic entropy of LEDs with its optical performance. The results show that: (1) Entropy generation based on thermodynamics can characterize the degradation process of LEDs; (2) The proposed hybrid degradation prediction model based on the PE and Wiener method can achieve early failure warning of LEDs before the actual failure occurs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Thermodynamics","Temperature dependence","Uncertainty","Temperature","Energy dissipation","Predictive models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Light-emitting diode","Entropy generation","Permutation entropy","Neural network","Wiener process"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEPT52650.2021.9568181","publicationTitle":"2021 22nd International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 22nd International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9567715/9567716/09568181.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9567716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEPT52650.2021.9568181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid degradation modeling of light-emitting diode using permutation entropy and data-driven methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid degradation modeling of light-emitting diode using permutation entropy and data-driven methods","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568181/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"14 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9568181/","conferenceDate":"14-17 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"The National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51805147"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid degradation modeling of light-emitting diode using permutation entropy and data-driven methods","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"493.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065121S","chronDate":"14-17 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9567715","isNumber":"9567716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9567715","xplore-issue":"9567716","articleId":"9568181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9568280,"authors":[{"name":"Ioanna Souvatzoglou","affiliation":["University of Piraeus, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioanna","lastName":"Souvatzoglou","id":"37087031984"},{"name":"Athanasios Papadimitriou","affiliation":["University of Piraeus, Greece"],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Papadimitriou","id":"37085439824"},{"name":"Aitzan Sari","affiliation":["University of Piraeus, Greece"],"firstName":"Aitzan","lastName":"Sari","id":"38235623600"},{"name":"Vasileios Vlagkoulis","affiliation":["University of Piraeus, Greece"],"firstName":"Vasileios","lastName":"Vlagkoulis","id":"37086939715"},{"name":"Mihalis Psarakis","affiliation":["University of Piraeus, Greece"],"firstName":"Mihalis","lastName":"Psarakis","id":"37374522900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1609-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1610-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2765-933X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2576-1501"}],"articleNumber":"9568280","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Single event upsets","Random access memory","Artificial neural networks","Very large scale integration","Topology","Registers"]}],"abstract":"Neural Networks (NNs) are increasingly used in the last decade in several demanding applications, such as object detection and classification, autonomous driving, etc. Among different computing platforms for implementing NNs, FPGAs have multiple advantages due to design flexibility and high performance-to-watt ratio. Moreover, approximation techniques, such as quantization, have been introduced, which reduce the computational and storage requirements, thus enabling the integration of larger NNs into FPGA devices. On the other hand, FPGAs are sensitive to radiation-induced Single Event Upsets (SEUs). In this work, we perform an in-depth reliability analysis in an FPGA-based Binarized Fully Connected Neural Network (BNN) accelerator running a statistical fault injection campaign. The BNN benchmark has been produced by FINN, an open-source framework that provides an end-to-end flow from abstract level to design, making it easy to design customized FPGANN accelerators, while it also supports various approximation techniques. The campaign includes the injection of faults in the configuration memory of a state-of-the-art Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGA running the BNN, as well an exhaustive fault injection in the user flip flops. We have analyzed the fault injection results characterizing the SEU vulnerability of the circuit per network layer, per clock cycle, and register. In general, the results show that the BNNs are inherently resilient to soft errors, since a low portion of SEUs in the configuration memory and the flip flops, cause system crashes or misclassification errors.","doi":"10.1109/DFT52944.2021.9568280","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9568273/9568279/09568280.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT52944.2021.9568280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9568279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing the Single Event Upset Vulnerability of Binarized Neural Networks on SRAM FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568280/","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing the Single Event Upset Vulnerability of Binarized Neural Networks on SRAM FPGAs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"6 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9568280/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing the Single Event Upset Vulnerability of Binarized Neural Networks on SRAM FPGAs","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"001_DFTS_2021_Souvatzoglou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057263S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9568273","isNumber":"9568279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9568273","xplore-issue":"9568279","articleId":"9568280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-26"},{"_id":9568285,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The traffic sign detection and recognition system (TSDR) play an essential role in the intelligent transportation system (ITS). TSDR can be utilized for driver assistance and, eventually, driverless cars to reduce accidents. When driving an automobile, the driver's attention is usually drawn to the road. On the other hand, most traffic signs are situated on the side of the road, which may have contributed to the collision. TSDR allows drivers to view traffic sign information without having to divert their attention. Due to the existence of a large background, clutter, fluctuating degrees of illumination, varying sizes of traffic signs, and changing weather conditions, TSDR is an important but difficult process in intelligent transport systems. Many efforts have been made to find answers to the major issues that they face. The objective of this study addresses road traffic sign detection and recognition using a technique that initially detects the bounding box of a traffic sign. Then the detected traffic sign will be recognized for usage in a speeded-up process. Since safe driving necessitates real-time traffic sign detection, the YOLOv4 network was employed in this research. YOLOv4 was evaluated on our dataset, which consisted of manual annotations to identify 43 distinctive traffic signs classes. It was able to achieve an average recognition accuracy of 84.7%. Overall, the work adds by presenting a basic yet effective model for real-time detection and recognition of traffic signs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-16 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568285/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/9568285/","publicationDate":"16 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"16-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic road traffic signs detection and recognition using \u2018You Only Look Once\u2019 version 4 (YOLOv4)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic road traffic signs detection and recognition using \u2018You Only Look Once\u2019 version 4 (YOLOv4)","confLoc":"Colombo, Sri Lanka","sourcePdf":"SC-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04433S","chronDate":"16-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9568272","isNumber":"9568277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9568272","xplore-issue":"9568277","articleId":"9568285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9568298,"authors":[{"name":"Marcel Merten","affiliation":["University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Merten","id":"37088998872"},{"name":"Sebastian Huhn","affiliation":["University of Bremen, Germany","Cyber-Physical Systems, DFKI GmbH, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Sebastian","lastName":"Huhn","id":"37085849139"},{"name":"Rolf Drechsler","affiliation":["University of Bremen, Germany","Cyber-Physical Systems, DFKI GmbH, Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Drechsler","id":"37276502700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1609-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1610-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2765-933X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2576-1501"}],"articleNumber":"9568298","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568298","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heating systems","Fault tolerance","Memory management","Fault tolerant systems","Artificial neural networks","Very large scale integration","Hardware"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DFT52944.2021.9568298","pdfPath":"/iel7/9568273/9568279/09568298.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9568279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT52944.2021.9568298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Codeword-based Compactor for On-Chip Generated Debug Data Using Two-Stage Artificial Neural Networks","abstract":"The steadily increasing complexity of state-of-the-art designs requires enhanced capabilities for post-silicon test and debug. By this, the demands concerning the quality as well as the diagnostic capability are met. Several sophisticated techniques have been proposed in the past to address these new challenges. However, these techniques heavily enlarge the on-chip generated data that has to be stored in rarely available and highly expensive memory and, especially, to be transferred via a low-speed interface. Thus, applying data compression is a highly beneficial objective to reduce the dedicated on-chip memory and the required transfer time. This work proposes a novel compression technique, which significantly reduces the volume of on-chip generated debug data by orchestrating a deliberately parameterized two-stage neural network. More precisely, a codeword-based compression procedure is realized, which can be directly implemented in hardware and, hence, be seamlessly integrated into an existing test/debug infrastructure. So far, it has not been possible to realize such compression by classical (algorithmic) approaches allocating only reasonable hardware resources. The experimental evaluation validates that the proposed scheme achieves similar results as the off-chip codeword-based approach being applied for incoming test data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568298/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9568298/","publicationDate":"6 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Codeword-based Compactor for On-Chip Generated Debug Data Using Two-Stage Artificial Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Codeword-based Compactor for On-Chip Generated Debug Data Using Two-Stage Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"031_DFTS_2021_Merten.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105302S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9568273","isNumber":"9568279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9568273","xplore-issue":"9568279","articleId":"9568298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9568315,"authors":[{"name":"Shiron Thalagala","affiliation":["University of Macau, China"],"firstName":"Shiron","lastName":"Thalagala"},{"name":"Chamila Walgampaya","affiliation":["University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"Chamila","lastName":"Walgampaya"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0965-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-0966-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2613-8662"}],"articleNumber":"9568315","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568315","abstract":"Automated inspection of surface defects is beneficial for casting product manufacturers in terms of inspection cost and time, which ultimately affect overall business performance. Intelligent systems that are capable of image classification are widely applied in visual inspection as a major component of modern smart manufacturing. Image classification tasks performed by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently shown significant performance over the conventional machine learning techniques. Particularly, AlexNet CNN architecture, which was proposed at the early stages of the development of CNN architectures, shows outstanding performance. In this paper, we investigate the application of AlexN et CNN architecture-based transfer learning for the classification of casting surface defects. We used a dataset containing casting surface defect images of a pump impeller for testing the performance. We examined four experimental schemes where the degree of the knowledge obtained from the pre-trained model is varied in each experiment. Furthermore, using a simple grid search method we explored the best overall setting for two crucial hyperparameters. Our results show that despite the simple architecture, AlexN et with transfer learning can be successfully applied for the recognition of casting surface defects of the pump impeller.","doi":"10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568315","startPage":"129","endPage":"136","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems Engineering (SCSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9568272/9568277/09568315.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 International Research Conference on Smart Computing and Systems Engineering (SCSE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SCSE53661.2021.9568315","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9568277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of AlexNet convolutional neural network architecture-based transfer learning for automated recognition of casting surface defects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Casting","Visualization","Transfer learning","Impellers","Computer architecture","Inspection","Convolutional neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["automated inspection","casting defect detection","convolutional neural networks","hyperparameters","transfer learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Application of AlexNet convolutional neural network architecture-based transfer learning for automated recognition of casting surface defects","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/9568315/","publicationDate":"16 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"16-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of AlexNet convolutional neural network architecture-based transfer learning for automated recognition of casting surface defects","confLoc":"Colombo, Sri Lanka","sourcePdf":"SC-21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068032S","chronDate":"16-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9568272","isNumber":"9568277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9568272","xplore-issue":"9568277","articleId":"9568315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-30"},{"_id":9568339,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Gao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Gao"},{"name":"Jiajun Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jiajun","lastName":"Xiao"},{"name":"Pedro Reviriego","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Reviriego"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1609-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1610-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2765-933X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2576-1501"}],"articleNumber":"9568339","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Discrete Fourier transforms","Fault tolerant systems","Filter banks","Single event upsets","Random access memory","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital channelizer","Reliability","SRAM-FPGAs","Single Event Upsets","Fault Injection"]}],"abstract":"Digital channelizers are widely used in on-board processing (OBP) platforms to extract narrowband sub-channels from a wideband signal. The combination of a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and a polyphase filter bank is recognized as an efficient structure for the channelizer. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are a popular option for the implementation of digital channelizers due to their large computing capacity and good re-configurability. However, FPGA based digital channelizers will suffer single-event upsets (SEUs) on the space platform. This paper implements an 8-channel digital channelizer on Xilinx Zynq SoC, and performs hardware fault injection experiments to evaluate the reliability of the channelizer to SEUs on the configuration memory. In particular, the effect of SEUs on the DFT part and the polyphase filter bank part are examined separately. Experiment results show that about 75% of the SEUs will not affect the operation of the digital channelizer. For the DFT part, SEUs on most critical bits will cause wrong outputs of 8 or 4 sub-channels, and a very small portion of SEUs will cause no outputs of 8 or 4 sub-channels. On the other hand, the effect of the SEUs on the phase filter will be amplified by the DFT, so that all the sub-channels can be corrupted. These initial evaluation results can be valuable to guide the design of efficient fault tolerance schemes for parallel channelizers in future OBP platforms.","doi":"10.1109/DFT52944.2021.9568339","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9568273/9568279/09568339.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT52944.2021.9568339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9568279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability Evaluation of Digital Channelizers Implemented on SRAM - FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568339/","displayDocTitle":"Reliability Evaluation of Digital Channelizers Implemented on SRAM - FPGAs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9568339/","publicationDate":"6 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100012818","fundingName":"Madrid Community research project TAPIR-CM","grantNumber":"P2018/TCS-4496"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability Evaluation of Digital Channelizers Implemented on SRAM - FPGAs","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"005_DFTS_2021_Gao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048097S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9568273","isNumber":"9568279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9568273","xplore-issue":"9568279","articleId":"9568339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9568340,"authors":[{"name":"Elaheh Malekzadeh","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Elaheh","lastName":"Malekzadeh"},{"name":"Nezam Rohbani","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Nezam","lastName":"Rohbani"},{"name":"Zhonghai Lu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zhonghai","lastName":"Lu"},{"name":"Masoumeh Ebrahimi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Masoumeh","lastName":"Ebrahimi"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1609-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1610-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2765-933X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2576-1501"}],"articleNumber":"9568340","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Fault tolerance","Program processors","Sensitivity","Fault tolerant systems","Discrete Fourier transforms","Single event upsets"]}],"abstract":"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are showing superior advantages in different domains and are opening their path into critical applications where reliability is the main concern. DNNs can be executed in different hardware platforms, including general-purpose processors which usually operate under floating-point (FP) numbering systems. Considering the small range of weights in DNNs stored in the FP format, some bits remain constant as 0 or 1 for all weights. On the other hand, a single event upset may flip a bit, increasing or decreasing the value of a weight. In this paper, we analyze the effect of bit flips in a sample network of LeNetS, and show the sensitivity of convolution layers to faults and the vulnerability of D NN s to a single fault in a specific bit position. This is while the network is inherently robust against bit flips in the other bit positions. We then show that the choice of activation functions and pooling techniques could alleviate the negative effects of faults to a large extend.","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9568273/9568279/09568340.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of Faults on DNNs: A Case Study","doi":"10.1109/DFT52944.2021.9568340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9568279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT52944.2021.9568340","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of Faults on DNNs: A Case Study","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","publicationDate":"6 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9568340/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001858","fundingName":"VINNOVA (Sweden 's Innovation Agency) through the Trust-E project of the Eureka PENTA and EURIPIDES programmes"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001862","fundingName":"VR (Swedish Research Council)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of Faults on DNNs: A Case Study","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"004_DFTS_2021_Malekzadeh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081289S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9568273","isNumber":"9568279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9568273","xplore-issue":"9568279","articleId":"9568340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9568343,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Chang","affiliation":["National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Chang"},{"name":"Yu-Guang Chen","affiliation":["National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Guang","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Po-Yeh Huang","affiliation":["National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Yeh","lastName":"Huang"},{"name":"Jin-Fu Li","affiliation":["National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jin-Fu","lastName":"Li"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1609-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1610-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2765-933X"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2576-1501"}],"articleNumber":"9568343","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Aging-Aware CMOS SRAM Structure Design for Boolean Logic In-Memory Computing","abstract":"In-memory computing (IMC), which processes data directly in memory arrays through analog signal capture, provides fast and efficient Boolean logic computation.

Recently, a 16-bit floating point format called Brain-Float 16 (bf16) has been proposed and implemented in hardware accelerators.

In this paper, we perform a comparison of the robustness of state-of-the art CNNs implemented with 8-bit integer, Brain-Float 16 and 32-bit floating point formats. We also introduce an error detection and masking technique, called opportunistic parity (OP), which can detect and mask errors in the weights with zero storage overhead. With this technique, the robustness of floating point weights to bit-flips can be improved by up to three orders of magnitude.","doi":"10.1109/DFT52944.2021.9568363","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI and Nanotechnology Systems (DFT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9568273/9568279/09568363.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFT52944.2021.9568363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9568279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-Overhead Protection for CNN Weights","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568363/","displayDocTitle":"Zero-Overhead Protection for CNN Weights","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9568363/","publicationDate":"6 Oct. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","conferenceDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Zero-Overhead Protection for CNN Weights","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"002_DFTS_2021_Burel.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053956S","chronDate":"6-8 Oct. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9568273","isNumber":"9568279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9568273","xplore-issue":"9568279","articleId":"9568363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9568439,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Fen Hsieh","affiliation":["Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chia-Fen","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37896367700"},{"name":"Che-Min Su","affiliation":["Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Che-Min","lastName":"Su","id":"37089002787"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4143-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4144-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2768-4156"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2768-4148"}],"articleNumber":"9568439","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568439","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Technological innovation","Computational modeling","Network intrusion detection","Network security","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intrusion Detection","Machine Learning","Deep Neural Network","Network Security","Feature Selection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICASI52993.2021.9568439","pdfPath":"/iel7/9568276/9567900/09568439.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 7th International Conference on Applied System Innovation (ICASI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 7th International Conference on Applied System Innovation (ICASI)","startPage":"22","endPage":"25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9567900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASI52993.2021.9568439","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DNNIDS: A Novel Network Intrusion Detection Based on Deep Neural Network","abstract":"With the rapid development of the network, network security is a relatively important issue.

Furthermore, the most important aspect of cognitive radio networks is security, and it is one of the features that should be given particular consideration, particularly in the field of security. We concentrate on general VANETs protection mechanisms in this article, which is divided into three sections. The first section provides a comprehensive overview of VANETs security features, risks, and requirements. To implement a robust VANETs infrastructure that allows for effective contact between parties, these requirements must be taken into account. Current security architectures and well-known security specification protocols are described in detail. The second approach relies on reclassifying the various VANET attacks and remedies that have been discussed in the literature. The third approach compares each of these innovations in VANETs using well-known security principles. Then we go through some of the open problems and technical challenges surrounding VANETs security, which can help researchers decide whether or not to pursue this field.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICICT52195.2021.9568469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9567896","startPage":"167","endPage":"173","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 International Conference on Communication & Information Technology (ICICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9568275/9567896/09568469.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Security Challenges with Cognitive Radio Environments for VANETS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-6 June 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9568469/","displayDocTitle":"The Security Challenges with Cognitive Radio Environments for VANETS","conferenceDate":"5-6 June 2021","publicationDate":"5 June 2021","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Security Challenges with Cognitive Radio Environments for VANETS","confLoc":"Basrah, Iraq","sourcePdf":"29-The_Security_Challenges_with_Cognitive.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068297S","chronDate":"5-6 June 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9568275","isNumber":"9567896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9568275","xplore-issue":"9567896","articleId":"9568469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9568486,"authors":[{"name":"Helat A.

Spectrum-to-space mapping is achieved through two dual-port chip integrated waveguide (CIW)-based leaky-wave antennas (LWAs). Interfacing with the two LWAs, we integrate two transmitting and receiving chains operating between 360- and 400-GHz range in a single chip realized in a 65-nm bulk CMOS process. Utilizing the carefully engineered dispersive nature of the LWA and its frequency-dependent radiation patterns, we create unique spectrum-to-space calibration maps for both 1-D and 2-D angular localizations. The measured one-shot localization error variance is less than 1\u00b0 in 1-D space with 200-Hz-resolution bandwidth (BW) and less than 2\u00b0 in 2-D space for a 20-Hz-resolution BW. The high-resolution nature of the localization principle in a single-shot fashion makes this approach attractive for multi-wireless node localization, link discovery, beam-forming, beam-management, and beam-optimization methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"THz Prism: One-Shot Simultaneous Localization of Multiple Wireless Nodes With Leaky-Wave THz Antennas and Transceivers in CMOS","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2021.3115407","endPage":"3854","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/9625642/09568636.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"3840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2021.3115407","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9625642","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568636","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Location awareness","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Antenna measurements","Semiconductor device measurement","Frequency measurement","Dispersion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","antenna","beam management","beamforming","chip integrated waveguide (CIW)","CMOS","frequency multiplier","leaky-wave antenna","link discovery","localization","substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)","terahertz (THz)","traveling wave antenna","waveguide"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"THz Prism: One-Shot Simultaneous Localization of Multiple Wireless Nodes With Leaky-Wave THz Antennas and Transceivers in CMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568636/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9568636/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"23 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office"},{"fundingName":"Mistletoe Research Fellowship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"THz Prism: One-Shot Simultaneous Localization of Multiple Wireless Nodes With Leaky-Wave THz Antennas and Transceivers in CMOS","sourcePdf":"jssc-saeidi-3115407-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105059S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"9625642","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","xplore-issue":"9625642","articleId":"9568636","onlineDate":"12 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":9568648,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Singh","affiliation":["IMEC Netherlands, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/9625642/9568648/singh-3116895-small.gif","p":["Gaurav Singh received the B.Tech. degree from DAIICT, Gandhinagar, India, in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree (cum laude) in microelectronics from Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands, in 2011.","From 2007 to 2009, he was working with Cypress Semiconductor, India, as an Application Engineer, defining next generation memory and mixed-signal programmable systems on chip products.

Such \u201csingle snapshot imaging\u201d provides timely situational awareness, but can utilize neither platform motion, as in synthetic aperture radar, nor track targets across time, as in Kalman filtering and its variants. Associating measurements with targets becomes a fundamental bottleneck in this setting. In this paper, we present a computationally efficient method to extract 2D position and velocity of multiple targets using a linear array of FMCW radar sensors by identifying and exploiting inherent geometric features to drastically reduce the complexity of spatial association. The proposed framework is robust to detection anomalies, and achieves order of magnitude lower complexity compared to conventional methods.

Data analytics is an important application scenario for embedded systems. Unfortunately, due to the limitation of the capacity of the embedded device, the scale of problems handled by the embedded system is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel data analytics method, called G-TADOC, for efficient text analytics directly on compression on embedded GPU systems. A large amount of data can be compressed and stored in embedded systems, and can be processed directly in the compressed state, which greatly enhances the processing capabilities of the systems. Particularly, G-TADOC has three innovations. First, a novel fine-grained thread-level workload scheduling strategy for GPU threads has been developed, which partitions heavily-dependent loads adaptively in a fine-grained manner. Second, a GPU thread-safe memory pool has been developed to handle inconsistency with low synchronization overheads. Third, a sequence-support strategy is provided to maintain high GPU parallelism while ensuring sequence information for lossless compression. Moreover, G-TADOC involves special optimizations for embedded GPUs, such as utilizing the CPU-GPU shared unified memory. Experiments show that G-TADOC provides 13.2\u00d7 average speedup compared to the state-of-the-art TADOC. G-TADOC also improves performance-per-cost by 2.6\u00d7 and energy efficiency by 32.5\u00d7 over TADOC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring Data Analytics Without Decompression on Embedded GPU Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2021.3119402","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/9603995/09568774.pdf","startPage":"1553","endPage":"1568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2021.3119402","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9603995","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568774/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2022","displayDocTitle":"Exploring Data Analytics Without Decompression on Embedded GPU Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/9568774/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2021","publicationDate":"1 July 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1004401"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61732014, 62172419, U20A20226 and 61802412"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality","grantNumber":"4202031"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua University-Peking Union Medical College Hospital Initiative Scientific Research Program","grantNumber":"20191080594"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture","grantNumber":"CARCHA202007"},{"fundingName":"GHfund A","grantNumber":"20210701"},{"fundingName":"CCF-Tencent Open Research Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring Data Analytics Without Decompression on Embedded GPU Systems","sourcePdf":"tpds-zhang-3119402-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13609S","chronDate":"July 1 2022","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"9603995","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","xplore-issue":"9603995","articleId":"9568774","onlineDate":"12 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":9568854,"authors":[{"name":"Kunzan Liu","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kunzan","lastName":"Liu","orcid":"0000-0002-3923-3720"},{"name":"Zijian Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zijian","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-1634-9077"},{"name":"Linglong Dai","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Linglong","lastName":"Dai","orcid":"0000-0002-4250-7315"},{"name":"Shenheng Xu","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shenheng","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0003-0105-8194"},{"name":"Fan Yang","affiliation":["Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology (BNRist), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-0362-4236"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9568854","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading channels","Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Power demand","Optimization","MIMO communication","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)","sub-connected architecture","energy efficiency (EE)","beamforming design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568854","abstract":"To overcome the \u201cmultiplicative fading effect\u201d introduced by passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), the concept of active RIS has been recently proposed to amplify the radiated signals. However, the existing fully-connected architecture of active RIS consumes high power due to the additionally integrated active components. To address this issue, we propose the sub-connected architecture of active RIS. Different from fully-connected architecture, where each element integrates a dedicated power amplifier, in the sub-connected architecture, multiple elements control their phase shifts independently but share a same power amplifier, which significantly reduces the number of power amplifiers for power saving at the cost of fewer degrees of freedom (DoFs) for beamforming design. Fortunately, our analysis reveals that performance loss introduced by the sub-connected architecture is slight, indicating that it can achieve much higher energy efficiency (EE). Furthermore, we formulate the EE maximization problem in the active RIS-aided system for both architectures and develop a corresponding joint beamforming design. Simulation results verify the proposed sub-connected architecture as an energy-efficient realization of active RIS.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3119696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2021.3119696","startPage":"167","endPage":"171","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/9674048/09568854.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9674048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface: Fully-Connected or Sub-Connected?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","displayDocTitle":"Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface: Fully-Connected or Sub-Connected?","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2022","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9568854/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568854/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2020YFB1807201"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62031019"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission through the H2020-MSCA-ITN META WIRELESS Research Project","grantNumber":"956256"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface: Fully-Connected or Sub-Connected?","sourcePdf":"lcomm-dai-3119696-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090581S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"9674048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","xplore-issue":"9674048","articleId":"9568854","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":9568856,"authors":[{"name":"Sharu Theresa Jose","affiliation":["King\u2019s Communications, Learning, and Information Processing (KCLIP) Laboratory, King\u2019s College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Sharu Theresa Jose (Member, IEEE) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from the TKM College of Engineering, Kollam, India, in 2011, the M.Tech. degree in systems and control from the IIT Roorkee in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree from the Systems and Control Engineering Group, IIT Bombay, in 2018.

The inductive bias is encoded by hyperparameters that determine aspects of the model class or training algorithm, such as initialization or learning rate. Meta-learning assumes that the learning tasks belong to a task environment, and that tasks are drawn from the same task environment both during meta-training and meta-testing. This, however, may not hold true in practice. In this paper, we introduce the problem of transfer meta-learning, in which tasks are drawn from a target task environment during meta-testing that may differ from the source task environment observed during meta-training. Novel information-theoretic upper bounds are obtained on the transfer meta-generalization gap, which measures the difference between the meta-training loss, available at the meta-learner, and the average loss on meta-test data from a new, randomly selected, task in the target task environment. The first bound, on the average transfer meta-generalization gap, captures the meta-environment shift between source and target task environments via the KL divergence between source and target data distributions. The second, PAC-Bayesian bound, and the third, single-draw bound, account for this shift via the log-likelihood ratio between source and target task distributions. Furthermore, two transfer meta-learning solutions are introduced. For the first, termed Empirical Meta-Risk Minimization (EMRM), we derive bounds on the average optimality gap. The second, referred to as Information Meta-Risk Minimization (IMRM), is obtained by minimizing the PAC-Bayesian bound. IMRM is shown via experiments to potentially outperform EMRM.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3119605","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"474","endPage":"501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3119605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9660615","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9660615/09568856.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Task analysis","Training","Transfer learning","Loss measurement","Hospitals","Upper bound","Risk management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transfer meta-learning","information-theoretic generalization bounds","PAC-Bayesian bounds","single-draw bounds","information risk minimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transfer Meta-Learning: Information- Theoretic Bounds and Information Meta-Risk Minimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568856/","volume":"68","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9568856/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2021","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100010663","fundingName":"European Research Council (ERC) through the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme","grantNumber":"725731"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transfer Meta-Learning: Information- Theoretic Bounds and Information Meta-Risk Minimization","sourcePdf":"tit-jose-3119605-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135279S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9660615","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9660615","articleId":"9568856","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":9568858,"authors":[{"name":"Arafat Al-Dweik","affiliation":["Center for Cyber Physical Systems, Khalifa University (KU), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","Western University, London, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9568858/aldwe-3119368-small.gif","p":["Arafat Al-Dweik (Senior Member, IEEE) received the M.S.

The proposed NOMA system can utilize amplitude-coherent detection (ACD) which requires only the channel amplitude for equalization purposes. In what follows, three different designs for realizing the detection of the proposed NOMA are investigated. One is based on the maximum likelihood (ML) principle, while the other two are based on successive interference cancellation (SIC). Closed-form expressions for the BER of all detectors are derived and compared with the BER of the coherent ML detector. The obtained results, which are corroborated by simulations, demonstrate that, in most scenarios, the BER is dominated by multiuser interference rather than the absence of the channel phase information. Consequently, the BER using ML and ACD are comparable for various cases of interest. The paper also shows that the SIC detector is just an alternative approach to realize the ML detector, and hence, both detectors provide the same BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"245","endPage":"263","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09568858.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568858","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Receivers","Detectors","Silicon carbide","Complexity theory","Bit error rate","Modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","non-coherent detection","channel estimation","amplitude coherent","amplitude shift keying (ASK)","phase estimation","multiple access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient NOMA Design Without Channel Phase Information Using Amplitude-Coherent Detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9568858/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568858/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Khalifa University Competitive Internal Research Award","grantNumber":"CIRA 2020-056"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004052","fundingName":"King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"},{"fundingName":"European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation Programme","grantNumber":"812991"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient NOMA Design Without Channel Phase Information Using Amplitude-Coherent Detection","sourcePdf":"tcomm-aldweik-3119368-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.184037S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9568858","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23","associateArticle":[{"associateType":"Preprint","associateDoi":"10.36227/techrxiv.12195999.v1"}]},{"_id":9568860,"authors":[{"name":"Ma\u0142gorzata Wasilewska","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing and Telecommunications, Institute of Radiocommunications, Pozna\u0144 University of Technology, Pozna\u0144, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9568860/wasil-3119524-small.gif","p":["Ma\u0142gorzata Wasilewska (Student Member, IEEE) received the M.Sc. degree from the Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Pozna\u0144 University of Technology (PUT), in 2017, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Institute of Radiocommunications.

We first propose a new algorithm to adaptively select an appropriate set of multi-antenna access points (APs) to serve each user at any time instant. A multi-level hidden Markov model (HMM) is constructed to predict the trajectory of a user and forecast the changing set of serving APs for the user over time. Given the selected, time-changing sets of serving APs, we also formulate a new multi-objective power control problem to minimize a weighted sum of the energy and delay costs of the users. By employing Bernoulli bandit learning (BBL) and Gaussian bandit learning (GBL), two new energy-delay-aware power control strategies are developed to adapt unpredictable channel dynamics, minimize the energy-delay costs online, and remain effective over a long time even when sharp changes occur in the channels. Numerical results demonstrate that the new predictive selection of serving APs and the new learning-based energy-delay-aware power control policies can significantly improve the reliability of uplink transmissions in dynamic CF massive MIMO networks, as compared to state-of-the-art static oracle solutions.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119708","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09568873.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Delay-Aware Power Control for Reliable Transmission of Dynamic Cell-Free Massive MIMO","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9568873/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568873/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Delay-Aware Power Control for Reliable Transmission of Dynamic Cell-Free Massive MIMO","sourcePdf":"tcomm-lv-3119708-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106614S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9568873","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9568875,"authors":[{"name":"Aya Nabil","affiliation":["Faculty of Computers and Information Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9568875/nabil-3119596-small.gif","p":["Aya Nabil received the B.Sc. degree from the Information System Department, Faculty of Computer and Information Sciences, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt, in 2017.

Students are facing various difficulties in courses like \u201cProgramming\u201d and \u201cData Structures\u201d through undergraduate programs, which is why failure and dropout rates in these courses are high. Therefore, EDM is used to analyze students\u2019 data gathered from various educational settings to predict students\u2019 academic performance, which would help them to achieve better results in their future courses. The main goal of this paper is to explore the efficiency of deep learning in the field of EDM, especially in predicting students\u2019 academic performance, to identify students at risk of failure. A dataset collected from a public 4-year university was used in this study to develop predictive models to predict students\u2019 academic performance of upcoming courses given their grades in the previous courses of the first academic year using a deep neural network (DNN), decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor. In addition, we made a comparison between various resampling methods to solve the imbalanced dataset problem, such as SMOTE, ADASYN, ROS, and SMOTE-ENN. From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed DNN model can predict students\u2019 performance in a data structure course and can also identify students at risk of failure at an early stage of a semester with an accuracy of 89%, which is higher than models like decision tree, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09568875.pdf","startPage":"140731","endPage":"140746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of Students\u2019 Academic Performance Based on Courses\u2019 Grades Using Deep Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119596","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568875/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of Students\u2019 Academic Performance Based on Courses\u2019 Grades Using Deep Neural Networks","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9568875/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Prediction of Students\u2019 Academic Performance Based on Courses\u2019 Grades Using Deep Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"access-nabil-3119596-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095422S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9568875","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9568877,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Wu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China","Chongqing College of Electronic Engineering, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9568877/wu-3119544-small.gif","p":["Juan Wu received the M.S. degree in communication and information system from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2006, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

First, the SC decoding is designed to decode polar codes on insertion/deletion channels and the joint weight distribution is derived to measure the occurrence probability of different scenarios. Some scenarios with small occurrence probability can be pruned to obtain lower decoding complexity with negligible performance loss. Inspired by this, a fixed pruning strategy (FPS) is proposed to reduce the decoding complexity, which can prune as many scenarios as possible with the given performance requirement. By exploiting the periodicity of the joint weight distribution, the upper bound of the block error rate of the pruned SC decoding is derived. Furthermore, according to the convergence of the upper bound, a dynamic self-adjusting pruning strategy is designed to further reduce the decoding complexity and improve the flexibility of the pruning algorithm. Simulation results show that the decoding complexity of the proposed pruning-based decoding algorithms is significantly reduced compared to the state-of-the-art scenario simplified SC decoding algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119692","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119692","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"45","endPage":"58","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09568885.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568885","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Complexity theory","Polar codes","Codes","Upper bound","Heuristic algorithms","Watermarking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Polar codes","dynamic self-adjusting","successive cancellation","insertion/deletion error channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Complexity Successive-Cancellation Decoding for Polar Codes on Channels With Insertions and Deletions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9568885/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568885/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (\u201cPolar Codes over Insertion/Deletion Channel\u201d","grantNumber":"61871009"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012240","fundingName":"Academic Excellence Foundation of BUAA for Ph.D. Students","grantNumber":"BY1702114"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"202006020121"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Complexity Successive-Cancellation Decoding for Polar Codes on Channels With Insertions and Deletions","sourcePdf":"tcomm-sun-3119692-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096618S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9568885","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9568899,"authors":[{"name":"Bofeng Yuan","affiliation":["Qualcomm Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9568899/yuan-3119690-small.gif","p":["Bofeng Yuan received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in communication and information system from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California at Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA, in 2018.

However, several additional energy theft channels are introduced by the automation of the metering system. With data analysis techniques, adapting the smart grid significantly reduces energy theft loss. In this article, we proposed deep learning methods for the identification of power theft. A three-stage technique has been devised, which includes selection, extraction, and classification of features. In the selection phase, the average hybrid feature importance determines the most important features and high priority. The feature extraction technique employs the ZFNET method to remove the unwanted features. For the detection of electric fraud, we have applied Long Short Term Memory method embedded in Convolutional Neural Network technique (CNN-LSTM). Meta-heuristic techniques, including Black Widow Optimization (BWO) and Blue Monkey Optimization (BMO), are used to calculate optimized values for the hyperparameters of CNN-LSTM. The tuning of hyperparameters of the classifier helps in better training on data. After extensive simulation, our proposed methods CNN-LSTM-BMO and CNN-LSTM-BWO achieved an accuracy of 91% and 93%. Our proposed methods outperform all the existing compared schemes. The performance of our models has attained high accuracy and low error rate. Furthermore, the statistical analysis also shows the superiority of the proposed methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Meters","Support vector machines","Smart grids","Feature extraction","Convolutional neural networks","Smart meters","Optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimization techniques","smart grid","deep learning methods","ensembler","black widow optimizer","CNN"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119575","startPage":"141154","endPage":"141166","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09568902.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Method CNN-LSTM Ensembler Based on Black Widow and Blue Monkey Optimizer for Electricity Theft Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Method CNN-LSTM Ensembler Based on Black Widow and Blue Monkey Optimizer for Electricity Theft Detection","publicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9568902/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Novel Method CNN-LSTM Ensembler Based on Black Widow and Blue Monkey Optimizer for Electricity Theft Detection","sourcePdf":"access-ayub-3119575-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.312072S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9568902","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9568906,"authors":[{"name":"Chanwoong Hwang","affiliation":["Hoseo University, Asan, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9568906/hwang-3119573-small.gif","p":["Chanwoong Hwang received the B.S. degree in information security from Hoseo University, Asan, South Korea, in 2020, where he is currently pursuing the M.Sc. degree with the Information Security Department.

These changes increase the likelihood of security vulnerabilities and accidents. As the risk of cyberattacks on ICS has increased, various anomaly detection studies are being conducted to detect abnormal situations in industrial processes. However, anomaly detection in ICS suffers from numerous false alarms. When false alarms occur, multiple sensors need to be checked, which is impractical. In this study, when an anomaly is detected, sensors displaying abnormal behavior are visually presented through XAI-based analysis to support quick practical actions and operations. Anomaly Detection has designed and applied better anomaly detection technology than the first prize at HAICon2020, an ICS security threat detection AI contest hosted by the National Security Research Institute last year, and explains the anomalies detected in its model.

The following DL application areas are covered: i) radar waveform and antenna array design; ii) passive or low probability of interception (LPI) radar waveform recognition; iii) automatic target recognition (ATR) based on high range resolution profiles (HRRPs), Doppler signatures, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images; and iv) radar jamming/clutter recognition and suppression. Although DL is unanimously praised as the ultimate solution to many bottleneck problems in most of existing works on similar topics, both the positive and the negative sides of stories about DL are checked in this work. Specifically, two limiting factors of the real-life performance of deep neural networks (DNNs), limited training samples and adversarial examples, are thoroughly examined. By investigating the relationship between the DL-based algorithms proposed in various papers and linking them together to form a full picture, this work serves as a valuable source for researchers who are seeking potential research opportunities in this promising research field.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9568916/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","publicationDate":"2021","volume":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Deep-Learning for Radar: A Survey","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"1004-XZA20014"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation from Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20200420"},{"fundingName":"Research Funds for New Faculty of NUAA","grantNumber":"1004-YAH19111"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Deep-Learning for Radar: A Survey","sourcePdf":"access-geng-3119561-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.244688S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9568916","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9568920,"authors":[{"name":"Tuan Thanh Nguyen","affiliation":["Science, Mathematics and Technology Cluster, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Tuan Thanh Nguyen received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2014 and 2019, respectively.

In a SECC, each codeword is divided into smaller non-overlapping windows, called subblocks, and every subblock is constrained to carry sufficient energy. In a SWCC, however, the energy constraint is enforced over every window. In this work, we focus on the binary channel, where sufficient energy is achieved theoretically by using relatively high weight codes, and study the bounded SECCs and bounded SWCCs, where the weight in every window is bounded between a minimum and maximum number. Particularly, we focus on the cases of parameters that there is no rate loss, i.e. the channel capacity is one, and propose two methods to construct capacity-approaching codes with low redundancy and linear-time complexity, based on Knuth\u2019s balancing technique and sequence replacement technique. These methods can be further extended to construct SECCs and SWCCs. For certain codes parameters, our methods incur only one redundant bit. We also impose the minimum distance constraint for error correction capability of the designed codes, which helps to reduce the error propagation during decoding as well.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Design of Subblock Energy-Constrained Codes and Sliding Window-Constrained Codes","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2021.3119568","endPage":"7924","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/9622121/09568920.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"7914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2021.3119568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9622121","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568920","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Redundancy","Encoding","Complexity theory","Optical transmitters","Indexes","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy-harvesting","constrained codes","error correction codes","encoding","decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Design of Subblock Energy-Constrained Codes and Sliding Window-Constrained Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568920/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2021","volume":"67","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/9568920/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001459","fundingName":"Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund Tier 2","grantNumber":"MOE2019-T2-2-123"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Design of Subblock Energy-Constrained Codes and Sliding Window-Constrained Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-nguyen-3119568-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108395S","chronDate":"Dec.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"9622121","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"9622121","articleId":"9568920","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-22"},{"_id":9568938,"authors":[{"name":"Geeth P.

Hence, the European telecommunications standard institute (ETSI) has defined four packet types, with varying priority levels, to be used as broadcast packets in such communication. This paper studies the medium access control (MAC) layer performance of IEEE 802.11p and cellular-V2X (C-V2X) Mode 4 using discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) based models, while considering parallel multi-priority data streams. The overall model consists of four queue models with their respective traffic generators, which are appropriately linked with the DTMCs modeling the MAC layer operations of IEEE 802.11p and C-V2X Mode 4. Closed-form solutions for the steady-state probabilities of the models are obtained, which are then utilized to derive expressions for key performance indicators at the MAC layer. Numerical results are provided to draw insights on the MAC layer performance of the two technologies. IEEE 802.11p is comparatively superior in average delay, and at maintaining fairness among multi-priority data streams, whereas C-V2X Mode 4 exhibits better collision resolution, which leads to its higher throughput. The paper also includes design insights on possible performance enhancements for future releases.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119703","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"592","endPage":"605","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09568938.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568938","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Data models","Quality of service","Magnetohydrodynamics","Analytical models","Vehicle-to-everything","Standards"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative environmental notification messages","C-V2X Mode 4","decentralized environmental notification messages","discrete-time Markov chain","IEEE 802.11p","medium access control","vehicle-to-vehicle communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Effect of Concurrent Multi-Priority Data Streams on the MAC Layer Performance of IEEE 802.11p and C-V2X Mode 4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9568938/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568938/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme","grantNumber":"857031"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland 6Genesis Flagship","grantNumber":"318927"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009689","fundingName":"AHEAD/RA3/RIC/MRT/ITS-Multidisciplinary Transport Development Project of the University of Moratuwa under World Bank","grantNumber":"6026-LK/ 8743-LK"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Effect of Concurrent Multi-Priority Data Streams on the MAC Layer Performance of IEEE 802.11p and C-V2X Mode 4","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wijesiri-3119703-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099688S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9568938","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9568942,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Alberto Aranda","affiliation":["ARIES Research Center, Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9568942/arand-3119633-small.gif","p":["Luis Alberto Aranda received the B.Sc. degree in industrial engineering and the M.Sc. in robotics from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain, in 2012 and 2015 respectively, and the Ph.D. degree (Hons.) in industrial engineering from the Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, Madrid, Spain, in 2018.","He worked as a Project Engineer with Zeus Creative Technologies S.L. developing various computer vision projects, from 2013 to 2014.

However, an FPGA-based platform could also be exploited to support the emulation of transient and permanent errors for designs intended to work in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or radiation-hardened devices such as antifuse FPGAs. In this context, the obtention of a particular set of bits to flip is required to be able to emulate these error models. The main difficulty of this approach lies in determining the mentioned set of bits, which is due to the unavailability of a public description of the bitstream and the lack of FPGA architecture details. To help with this issue, we present a methodology to determine specific configuration memory bits from SRAM-based FPGAs that, when flipped, emulate permanent or transient upsets in any flip-flop element of the design under test. This methodology is proved in recent FPGA technologies and provides great control and precision in reliability experiments for harsh environments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568942/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9568942/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","volume":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reliability Analysis of ASIC Designs With Xilinx SRAM-Based FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Reliability Analysis of ASIC Designs With Xilinx SRAM-Based FPGAs","sourcePdf":"access-aranda-3119633-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081157S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9568942","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9568952,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xi\u2019an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9568952/wu-3119609-small.gif","p":["Jin Wu received the B.S. degree in automation major and the M.S. degree in control science and engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, in 1998 and 2001, respectively.

First of all, a residual module is added to the 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) to avoid problems such as gradient dispersion caused by the deepening of the network layer; Secondly, not only the global average pooling layer but also the global maximum pooling layer is used in the SENet network, which can fully extract global information and achieve feature calibration. In the meantime, expand the SENet network to three-dimensional, which can make the connection of the spatiotemporal feature channels closer. Afterwards, the 3D-SE module is introduced into the R3D network, which can enhance the effective spatiotemporal features and suppress the invalid spatiotemporal features; Since, because LSTM can perform timing modeling on high-level features and learn more effective feature information, the LSTM network is introduced into the SE-R3D network. Finally, Softmax is used for classification. Experimental results show that the recognition rate of the SE-R3D-LSTM network on the UCF101 data set reaches 96.5%.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119609","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09568952.pdf","startPage":"141002","endPage":"141012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568952/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"Behavior Recognition Algorithm Based on the Fusion of SE-R3D and LSTM Network","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9568952/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61834005, 61772417, 61802304, 61602377 and 61634004"},{"fundingName":"Shaanxi Province International Science and Technology Cooperation Project","grantNumber":"xyt2018KW-006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Behavior Recognition Algorithm Based on the Fusion of SE-R3D and LSTM Network","sourcePdf":"access-an-3119609-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077464S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9568952","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":9568953,"authors":[{"name":"Hengjia Wei","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Hengjia Wei received the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China, in 2014.","He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with Capital Normal University, Beijing, China, from 2014 to 2016, and a Research Fellow with the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, from 2016 to 2019.

Take the advantage of owning wireless infrastructures, the telco operator is motivated to build a content platform for entering the market of content. In this paper, we consider a content platform belonging to the telco operator, which can provide periodically-updated contents with small Age of Information (AoI), namely, fresh contents. The content update consumes radio resource resulting in a trade-off between the AoI and the latency. We adopt the contract theory to monetize contents considering the above two factors in a realistic asymmetric information scenario. Necessary and sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the feasibility of the contract. We further propose the optimal update schemes and the corresponding fees, which maximizes the utility of the operator. Simulation reveals that the proposed contract enables the users, who attach importance to the freshness, to obtain frequently updating contents.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09568955.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119693","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Towards Small AoI and Low Latency via Operator Content Platform: A Contract Theory-Based Pricing","volume":"70","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9568955/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568955/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U20A20158"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012166","fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2018YFB1801104"},{"fundingName":"Ningbo S&T Major Project","grantNumber":"2019B10079"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2020QNA5011"},{"fundingName":"ZJU-SUTD Innovation, Design and Entrepreneurship Alliance"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Small AoI and Low Latency via Operator Content Platform: A Contract Theory-Based Pricing","sourcePdf":"tcomm-wang-3119693-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123993S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9568955","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9568962,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanzhe Geng","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/9681827/9568962/geng-3119689-small.gif","p":["Yuanzhe Geng received the B.S. degree from Hohai University, China, in 2019.

To reduce outage probability, existing studies propose many schemes for relay selection and power allocation, which are usually based on the assumption of exact channel state information (CSI). However, it is difficult to obtain perfect instantaneous CSI in practical situations where channel states change rapidly, and thus traditional methods would not perform well. Considering these factors, we turn to the emerging reinforcement learning (RL) methods for solutions. RL methods do not need any prior knowledge of CSI, but use neural network for approximation and decision after interacting with communication environment. Nevertheless, conventional RL methods, including most deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods, cannot perform well when the search space is too large. In addition, non-stationarity is a common problem when using hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), which is caused by the changing behavior in different hierarchies. Therefore, we first propose a DRL framework with an outage-based reward function, which is then used as a baseline. Then, we further design an HRL framework and training algorithm. By decomposing relay selection and power allocation into two hierarchical optimization objectives, and combining on- policy and off-policy methods in the HRL framework, our method successfully address the sparse reward and non-stationary problem. Simulation results reveal that compared with traditional DRL method, the proposed HRL training algorithm can converge faster and reduce the outage probability by 8% in two-hop relay network with the same outage threshold.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3119689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9681827","startPage":"171","endPage":"184","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/9681827/09568962.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9568962","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Resource management","Probability","Power system reliability","Optimization","Signal to noise ratio","Relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative communication","outage probability","relay selection","power allocation","hierarchical reinforcement learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Relay Selection and Power Optimization in Two-Hop Cooperative Relay Network","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2022","isJournal":true,"volume":"70","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2022","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2022","htmlLink":"/document/9568962/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568962/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"42171404 and 61771345"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003399","fundingName":"Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality","grantNumber":"19511102002"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan Project","grantNumber":"21220713100"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Relay Selection and Power Optimization in Two-Hop Cooperative Relay Network","sourcePdf":"tcomm-geng-3119689-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095786S","chronDate":"Jan.  2022","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"9681827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","xplore-issue":"9681827","articleId":"9568962","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2022","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-23"},{"_id":9568965,"authors":[{"name":"Mobeen Ahmad","affiliation":["Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/9312710/9568965/ahmad-3119655-small.gif","p":["Mobeen Ahmad received the B.S. degree in electrical (computer) engineering from COMSATS University, Lahore, Pakistan, in 2013, and the M.S. degree in robotics and intelligent machine engineering from the National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2016.

Plant disease detection is an important area of deep learning which has been addressed by many recent methods. However, there is a dire need to optimize these solutions for resource-constrained portable devices such as smartphones. This is a challenging problem because deep learning models are resource extensive in nature. This paper proposes an efficient method to systematically classify plant disease symptoms using convolutional neural networks. These networks are memory efficient and when coupled with the proposed training configuration it enables rapid development of industrial applications by reducing the training times. Another critical problem arises with the improper distribution of samples among classes known as the class imbalance problem, which is addressed by employing a simple statistical methodology. Transfer learning is a known technique for training small datasets which transfers pre-trained weights learned on a large dataset. However, during transfer learning, negative transfer learning is a common problem. Therefore, a stepwise transfer learning approach is proposed which can help in fast convergence, while reducing overfitting and preventing negative transfer learning during knowledge transfer across domains. The system is trained and evaluated on two plant disease datasets i.e., PlantVillage (a publicly available dataset) and pepper disease dataset provided by the National Institute of Horticultural and Herbal Science, Republic of Korea. The pepper dataset is particularly challenging as it contains images from different parts of the plant such as the leaf, pulp, and stem. The proposed system has dominated the previous works on the PlantVillage dataset and achieved 99% and 99.69% accuracy on the Pepper dataset and PlantVillage datasets, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119655","startPage":"140565","endPage":"140580","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09568965.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Plant Disease Detection in Imbalanced Datasets Using Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks With Stepwise Transfer Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568965/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Plant Disease Detection in Imbalanced Datasets Using Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks With Stepwise Transfer Learning","volume":"9","htmlLink":"/document/9568965/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"21203278","publicationDate":"2021","dateOfInsertion":"19 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003627","fundingName":"Cooperative Research Program for Agriculture Science and Technology Development through the Rural Development Administration, Republic of Korea","grantNumber":"PJ015686"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korean Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)]","grantNumber":"2021R1F1A106168711"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Plant Disease Detection in Imbalanced Datasets Using Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks With Stepwise Transfer Learning","sourcePdf":"access-han-3119655-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093326S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9568965","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-12-13"},{"_id":9568974,"authors":[{"name":"Lechen Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lechen","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Xia Lei","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Lei","orcid":"0000-0001-8137-0529"},{"name":"Yue Xiao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Xiao","orcid":"0000-0002-2127-8947"},{"name":"Teng Ma","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China","Guangdong Communications and Networks Institute, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Ma","orcid":"0000-0003-1179-5024"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"9568974","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"Novel communication technology based on large intelligent surface (LIS), which manipulates the phase of the incident waves to enhance the communication quality, has been proposed as a promising candidate for future wireless communication systems and standards.

One promising way to treat noisy labels is to use the small-loss trick based on the memorization effect, that is, clean and noisy samples are identified by observing the network\u2019s loss during training. Co-teaching+ is a state-of-the-art method that simultaneously trains two networks with small-loss selection using the \u201cupdate by disagreement\u201d strategy; however, it suffers from the problem that the selected samples tend to become noisy as the number of iterations increases. This phenomenon means that clean small-loss samples will be biased toward agreement data, which is the set of samples for which the two networks have the same prediction. This paper proposes an adaptive sample selection method to train deep neural networks robustly and prevent noise contamination in the disagreement strategy. Specifically, the proposed method calculates the threshold of the small-loss criterion by considering the loss distribution of the whole batch at each iteration. Then, the network is backpropagated by extracting samples below this threshold from the disagreement data. Combining the disagreement and agreement data of the two networks can suppress the degradation of the true-label rate of training data in a mini batch. Experiments were conducted using five commonly used benchmarks, MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, NEWS, and T-ImageNet to verify the robustness of the proposed method to noisy labels. The results show the proposed method improves generalization performance in an image classification task with simulated noise rates of up to 50%.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119582","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/9312710/09568980.pdf","startPage":"141131","endPage":"141143","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9312710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training Robust Deep Neural Networks on Noisy Labels Using Adaptive Sample Selection With Disagreement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9568980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Training Robust Deep Neural Networks on Noisy Labels Using Adaptive Sample Selection With Disagreement","volume":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","htmlLink":"/document/9568980/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004044","fundingName":"Kansai University Organization for Research and Development of Innovative Science and Technology (ORDIST) Research Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Training Robust Deep Neural Networks on Noisy Labels Using Adaptive Sample Selection With Disagreement","sourcePdf":"access-yoshida-3119582-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105742S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"9312710","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","xplore-issue":"9312710","articleId":"9568980","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":9569039,"authors":[{"name":"Shahrokh Hamidi","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Shahrokh","lastName":"Hamidi","id":"38352509800"},{"name":"Safieddin Safavi Naeini","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Safieddin Safavi","lastName":"Naeini","id":"37296964300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4864-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4865-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2576-7046"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"9569039","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","Imaging","Receiving antennas","Radar","Interference","Radar imaging","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDM MIMO FMCW radar","high resolution imaging"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we will be using a 79 G Hz Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar and apply the Code Division Multiplexing (CDM) method to increase the number of elements virtually.

In fact, using coded signals the effect of interference can be alleviated considerably.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE53047.2021.9569039","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (CCECE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569025/9569028/09569039.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE53047.2021.9569039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569028","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CDM Based Virtual FMCW MIMO Radar Imaging at 79 GHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CDM Based Virtual FMCW MIMO Radar Imaging at 79 GHz","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-17 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569039/","conferenceDate":"12-17 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"12 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9569039/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CDM Based Virtual FMCW MIMO Radar Imaging at 79 GHz","confLoc":"ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"1570712780.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061139S","chronDate":"12-17 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569025","isNumber":"9569028","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569025","xplore-issue":"9569028","articleId":"9569039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569046,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the solutions reported in state-of-the art literature, forecasting the changes in pollution levels is usually based on the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs), globally trained for a given area, e.g. a city. In contrast, we propose to equip the sensors with hardware-implemented ANN s that could make the prediction based on data that the network obtains from the place where particular sensor is installed. Such networks require appropriate hardware optimization to maintain low energy consumption of the overall sensor. For this reason, in this paper we present a method of optimizing one of more complex components that is involved in determining the value of neuron weights in the network training process. In this work, we focus on the backpropagation (BP) learning algorithm, which results from the widespread use of this type of network in predicting air pollution levels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569046/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569046/","publicationDate":"12 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"The Use of Artificial Neural Networks in Predicting Air Pollution in Cities - Hardware Implementation Issues","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Use of Artificial Neural Networks in Predicting Air Pollution in Cities - Hardware Implementation Issues","confLoc":"Nis, Serbia","sourcePdf":"MIEL2021_59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061215S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569024","isNumber":"9569026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569024","xplore-issue":"9569026","articleId":"9569046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9569080,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The problem is not trivial, especially in situations in which the structure of data to be classified by the neural network (NN) after completing the learning phase is not known. To cope with this problem, one of the solutions is to conduct comprehensive tests of the ANN with training it with data sets that differ in the distribution of the learning patterns in the input data space. In order to prepare such sets, appropriate tools are required that introduce the ability of a broad parameterization. In the proposed work, an advanced data generator has been developed, which based on a specific variability of particular predefined parameters, generates a collection of learning data sets. The obtained sets are then used to optimize the learning process of selected algorithms of self-organizing ANNs. The NN then automatically retrieves subsequent data sets from specific location, and as a response generates reports with an assessment of the quality of the learning process. The aim of the proposed investigations is to optimize the structure of selected ANNs, so as to obtain their minimum complexity, important in case of their hardware implementation.","doi":"10.1109/MIEL52794.2021.9569102","startPage":"267","endPage":"270","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Microelectronics (MIEL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569024/9569026/09569102.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd International Conference on Microelectronics (MIEL)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIEL52794.2021.9569102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Training Set Generator for Use in Self-Organizing Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Shape","Training data","Scattering","Artificial neural networks","Tools","Generators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Training Set Generator for Use in Self-Organizing Neural Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569102/","publicationDate":"12 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"12-14 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Training Set Generator for Use in Self-Organizing Neural Networks","confLoc":"Nis, Serbia","sourcePdf":"MIEL2021_58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070191S","chronDate":"12-14 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569024","isNumber":"9569026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569024","xplore-issue":"9569026","articleId":"9569102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9569148,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Recently, deep-learning-based methods have made significant progress for this task, while many challenges remain tackled. Firstly, it is hard to guarantee the objectivity of manual evaluation facial attractiveness, which results in labeling bias of training data. Secondly, the training data with attractiveness score required for a robust predictor is in severe shortage. For the former problem, we adopt the ELO rating algorithm prevalently used in sports to dynamically reorder the ranking of training images according to the comparisons between images. We propose a method based on attribute-induced regression with a multi-task Convolution Neural Network to overcome training data shortage for the last challenge. The method employs facial attributes of facial parts such as eyes, nose, mouth to restrain and reduce the facial attractiveness prediction problem\u2019s solution space. We collected, labeled, and ranked an Asian female face dataset with attributes for facial attractiveness analysis.

Channel prediction is a flexible way to combat channel aging without the cost of scarce time-frequency resources. Long short term memory (LSTM) is a class of neural networks, capable of processing data that has long-term dependence in time series. In this paper, an LSTM-based channel predictor is designed to achieve a longer range of predictions. Precoding matrix indicator (PMI) and rank indicator (RI) are two indicators related to precoding and the number of precoding matrices forming the codebook increased with the number of antenna ports. Furthermore, we try to calculate PMI/RI with the aid of the neural network. Through the simulation experiment, we test the performance of the LSTM channel predictor and the PMI/RI selector. The result illustrates that our predictor achieves considerable channel capacity gain and our selector shows high accuracy. Moreover, the generalization ability of the LSTM predictor for different antenna configurations is studied.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569267","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569267.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","startPage":"598","endPage":"603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Prediction and PMI/RI Selection in MIMO-OFDM Systems Based on Deep Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel Prediction and PMI/RI Selection in MIMO-OFDM Systems Based on Deep Learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569267/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9569267/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Prediction and PMI/RI Selection in MIMO-OFDM Systems Based on Deep Learning","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570715582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050453S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569292,"authors":[{"name":"Sandra Roger","affiliation":["Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, Burjassot (Valencia), Spain"],"firstName":"Sandra","lastName":"Roger","id":"37391695800"},{"name":"Carmen Botella-Mascarell","affiliation":["Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, Burjassot (Valencia), Spain"],"firstName":"Carmen","lastName":"Botella-Mascarell","id":"37284757900"},{"name":"Diego Lloria","affiliation":["Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, Burjassot (Valencia), Spain"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Lloria","id":"37089021385"},{"name":"Maximo Cobos","affiliation":["Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia, Burjassot (Valencia), Spain"],"firstName":"Maximo","lastName":"Cobos","id":"37391729100"},{"name":"G\u00e1bor Fodor","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, 16400, Sweden"],"firstName":"G\u00e1bor","lastName":"Fodor","id":"37270461500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569292","dbTime":"1 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Runtime","Channel estimation","Estimation","Complexity theory","Sparse matrices","Root mean square"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mmWave","channel estimation","MIMO","analog beamforming","transformed spatial domain"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569292","abstract":"High-accuracy angle of arrival (AoA) and angle of departure (AoD) estimation is critical for cell search, stable communications and positioning in millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular systems. Moreover, the design of low-complexity AoA/AoD estimation algorithms is also of major importance in the deployment of practical systems to enable a fast and resource-efficient computation of beamforming weights. Parametric mmWave channel estimation allows to describe the channel matrix as a combination of direction-dependent signal paths, exploiting the sparse characteristics of mmWave channels. In this context, a fast Transformed Spatial Domain Channel Estimation (TSDCE) algorithm was recently proposed to perform parametric channel estimation with low complexity, which in turn results in a full characterization of the transmitting and receiving angles for dominant signal paths. In this paper, we analyze the AoA/AoD estimation capability and accuracy of the TSDCE algorithm in detail. We find that the TSDCE algorithm has a significant performance advantage with respect to the traditional approach, which is based on frequency domain processing, in complexity-constrained environments, especially at high signal-to-noise ratios.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569292","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569292.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity AoA and AoD Estimation in the Transformed Spatial Domain for Millimeter Wave MIMO Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569292/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity AoA and AoD Estimation in the Transformed Spatial Domain for Millimeter Wave MIMO Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569292/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003359","fundingName":"Generalitat Valenciana"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity AoA and AoD Estimation in the Transformed Spatial Domain for Millimeter Wave MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570724789.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064003S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9569296,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Wang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Automotive Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Jongeun Ha","affiliation":["Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jongeun","lastName":"Ha"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1468-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1467-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4754-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-9464"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2471-6146"}],"articleNumber":"9569296","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569296","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Recurrent neural networks","Text recognition","Shape","Education","Computer architecture","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural scenes","neural nets","recurrent neural nets","text analysis","text detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural scene text recognition","scene text recognition problem","challenging sub-fields","computer vision","deep learning","recognition task","convolutional recurrent neural network architecture","CRNN","feature extraction","sequence modeling","attention mechanism","previous scene text recognition systems","mainstream CNN network structures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scene text recognition","Convolutional recurrent neural network","Attention Mechanism"]}],"abstract":"In this article, we explore the scene text recognition problem, which is one of the challenging sub-fields of computer vision.

The NU does not use its own battery energy to relay to FU, and harvests energy using SWIPT principles from the BS. In this paper we consider a more practical nonlinear energy harvesting model for the first time in such a framework. We show that use of the idealized linear EH model leads to gross over-estimation of FU performance. Considering the time-splitting (TS) energy harvesting (EH) protocol, and modelling the self-interference at the FD NU, expressions are derived for the FU and NU outage probabilities in closed-form. Further, we show that by optimal selection of the TS parameter performance of FU can be further enhanced.

In this paper this technique is demonstrated with a Fifth Generation (5G) New Radio (NR) 8x4 MIMO radio. Dual polarized precoders are designed that utilize all 64 power amplifiers creating a wide sector beam.

However, mmWave signals usually suffer from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, which will affect mmWave MIMO-based UE localization performance. Hence, it is non-trivial to reveal how NLOS propagation affect mmWave-based UE localization performance. In this paper, we give a unified analysis framework for UE localization performance gain from harnessing NLOS propagation. Firstly, a closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bound on mmWave MIMO-based UE localization is derived to shed lights on its performance limit. Secondly, NLOS propagation-caused localization error for conventional UE localization methods without harnessing multipath effect is analysed. Finally, the information contribution from NLOS channel is quantified, which sheds light on how to smartly harness NLOS propagation and the associated UE localization performance gain.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How Much Localization Performance Gain Could Be Reaped by 5G mmWave MIMO Systems from Harnessing Multipath Propagation?","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569349","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569349.pdf","startPage":"1215","endPage":"1221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"How Much Localization Performance Gain Could Be Reaped by 5G mmWave MIMO Systems from Harnessing Multipath Propagation?","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569349/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How Much Localization Performance Gain Could Be Reaped by 5G mmWave MIMO Systems from Harnessing Multipath Propagation?","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570711542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05586S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569355,"authors":[{"name":"Alexei Davydov","affiliation":["Next Generation and Standards, Intel Corporation, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexei","lastName":"Davydov"},{"name":"Victor Sergeev","affiliation":["Next Generation and Standards, Intel Corporation, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Sergeev"},{"name":"Artyom Putilin","affiliation":["Next Generation and Standards, Intel Corporation, Nizhny Novgorod, Russia"],"firstName":"Artyom","lastName":"Putilin"},{"name":"Bishwarup Mondai","affiliation":["Next Generation and Standards, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bishwarup","lastName":"Mondai"},{"name":"Thushara Hewavithana","affiliation":["Network Platform Group, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Thushara","lastName":"Hewavithana"},{"name":"Apostolos Papathanassiou","affiliation":["Next Generation and Standards, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Apostolos","lastName":"Papathanassiou"},{"name":"Avik Sengupta","affiliation":["Next Generation and Standards, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Avik","lastName":"Sengupta"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569355","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5},"abstract":"Uplink massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) improves network spectral efficiency by enabling simultaneous transmission from multiple users through spatial multiplexing. Although the centralized radio access network (C-RAN) architecture can meet the increased signal processing requirements, the large number of used antenna elements creates challenges for the fronthaul (FH) links required to transport a large amount of traffic from remote radio units (RRUs) to the centralized baseband unit (BBU). To reduce the FH link load, different baseband splitting options between RRUs and BBU are considered in practical C-RAN networks. More specifically, low complexity maximum ratio combining (MRC) beamforming at the RRU can be used to reduce the number of spatial dimensions of the received signals before transporting them to the BBU for further baseband processing. Despite the high compression efficiency of the MRC-based approach, we find that its performance is not sufficiently robust under channel varying conditions due to rapid user mobility. In this paper, we propose a functional split based on an extension of MRC compression at the RRU which provides better uplink performance for scenarios with high mobility, while guaranteeing moderate FH link throughput and low signal processing complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569355.pdf","startPage":"1117","endPage":"1121","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uplink Massive MIMO Functional Split for C-RAN System Under Rapid User Mobility Conditions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","Spectral efficiency","Receivers","Massive MIMO","Throughput","MIMO","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","NR","C-RAN","High mobility","Uplink","Massive MIMO","Fronthaul capacity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Massive MIMO Functional Split for C-RAN System Under Rapid User Mobility Conditions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569355/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Massive MIMO Functional Split for C-RAN System Under Rapid User Mobility Conditions","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570714055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065668S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569356,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Doumit","affiliation":["Lab-STICC, UMR CNRS 6285, IMT Atlantique, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Doumit"},{"name":"Marie-Jos\u00e9pha Youssef","affiliation":["Lab-STICC, UMR CNRS 6285, IMT Atlantique, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Marie-Jos\u00e9pha","lastName":"Youssef"},{"name":"Charbel Abdel Nour","affiliation":["Lab-STICC, UMR CNRS 6285, IMT Atlantique, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Charbel Abdel","lastName":"Nour"},{"name":"Joumana Farah","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Lebanese University, Roumieh, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Joumana","lastName":"Farah"},{"name":"Catherine Douillard","affiliation":["Lab-STICC, UMR CNRS 6285, IMT Atlantique, Brest, France"],"firstName":"Catherine","lastName":"Douillard"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569356","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","NOMA","Simulation","Quality of service","Reliability engineering","Resource management","Internet of Things"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-orthogonal multiple access","uncoordinated system","relays","multi-armed bandits","full duplex","power allocation"]}],"abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a major driving use case of future communication systems. 5G and beyond networks should be properly designed to meet the quality of service (QoS) requirements of IoT devices in terms of massive access, data rates, latency and reliability.

In the considered setting, IoT devices aim at organizing their transmissions, without any coordination, on the available frequency channels and power levels. To enhance performance, we propose the deployment of full-duplex relays as well as the use of non-orthogonal multiple access and queuing at the level of the relays. A new algorithm, based on the multi-player multi-armed bandits framework, is proposed with the aim of reducing the transmit power of IoT devices. Simulation results validate the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Results also confirm the superior performance of the proposed technique in terms of satisfying QoS requirements and reducing the needed user transmit power when compared to two baseline schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation in Full-Duplex Uncoordinated Communication Systems with NOMA","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569356","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569356.pdf","startPage":"1104","endPage":"1110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569356","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation in Full-Duplex Uncoordinated Communication Systems with NOMA","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569356/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation in Full-Duplex Uncoordinated Communication Systems with NOMA","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570711936.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074295S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569372,"authors":[{"name":"K S Shafrin","affiliation":["School of Electrical Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Goa, Ponda, India"],"firstName":"K S","lastName":"Shafrin"},{"name":"K S Sanila","affiliation":["School of Electrical Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Goa, Ponda, India"],"firstName":"K S","lastName":"Sanila"},{"name":"Neelakandan Rajamohan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Goa, Ponda, India"],"firstName":"Neelakandan","lastName":"Rajamohan"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569372","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Radio frequency","Simulation","Bit error rate","Modulation","Detectors","Receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Space time block coding","Block sparsity","Compressive sensing","Quadrature spatial modulation"]}],"abstract":"Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) technology is emerging as a pragmatic approach to guarantee tremendous data traffic for future wireless communication systems. In this paper, a transmission scheme described as a space-time block coded structured quadrature spatial modulation (STBC-SQSM) for the mMIMO system is proposed. The STBC-SQSM scheme guarantees the diversity benefits of the STBC system. Moreover, the SQSM symbols take over the conventional STBC constellation points to convey additional information bits by antenna indices rather than individually by STBC blocks. Besides, it requires only a limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains despite the enormous data rate achieved by employing spatial multiplexing of multiple QSM symbols. Further, the proposed system proposes a structured Bayesian compressive sensing (S-BCS) and a structured multipath orthogonal matching pursuit (S-mOMP) based detectors with significantly reduced computational complexity. The simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme renders a more beneficial bit error rate (BER) performance and spectral gain than the existing systems.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569372","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569372.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","startPage":"788","endPage":"793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space Time Block Coding and Structured Multiplexing for Quadrature Spatial Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space Time Block Coding and Structured Multiplexing for Quadrature Spatial Modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569372/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9569372/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space Time Block Coding and Structured Multiplexing for Quadrature Spatial Modulation","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570712030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070504S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569379,"authors":[{"name":"Bitan Banerjee","affiliation":["University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"firstName":"Bitan","lastName":"Banerjee"},{"name":"Robert C.

Estimation of downlink CSI from uplink CSI using second order channel statistics, namely the channel covariance matrix (CCM), is a promising approach. However, published work so far has rarely applied machine learning techniques to solve this problem using CCMs, most probably due to the unavailability of a direct mapping function or parametric model for supervised learning to convert from uplink to downlink CCMs. In this paper, we develop a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) method for uplink-to-downlink CCM conversion. To apply the CGAN-based method, we convert the uplink and downlink CCMs to images and use image translation techniques for CGANs. The normalized mean square error performance of the proposed CGAN is evaluated for several antenna array sizes and with both perfect and imperfect knowledge of the CCMs. Our results demonstrate performance improvement over existing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569379","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569379.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","startPage":"940","endPage":"946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards FDD Massive MIMO: Downlink Channel Covariance Matrix Estimation Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Towards FDD Massive MIMO: Downlink Channel Covariance Matrix Estimation Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569379/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9569379/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards FDD Massive MIMO: Downlink Channel Covariance Matrix Estimation Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570715455.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078884S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569397,"authors":[{"name":"Yasser Naguib Ahmed","affiliation":["Cairo University, Giza, Egypt"],"firstName":"Yasser Naguib","lastName":"Ahmed"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569397","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569397","abstract":"It is well known that massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems rely on highly accurate channel state information (CSI).

Generally, student performance prediction can be achieved by tracing the evolution of each student\u2019s knowledge states via a series of learning activities. However, previous studies mainly focus on predicting the grade of students. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies focus on student competition award prediction, which is vital for students\u2019 development and learning process. In this paper, we aim to predict students\u2019 programming competition awards by building machine learning models with basic features and competition-related features extracted from 107 students. Specifically, we employ two kinds of data-driven-based features, which are basic features and programming competition-related features. The basic features are the personal and grade information of students in programming courses. The programming competition-related features are the performance data of students in the programming competition training activities. The empirical results show that the random forest model can achieve the best performance among all models with an Accuracy of 0.89, an F-measure of 0.88, a Precision of 0.90, and a Recall of 0.85.

To provide some insights, DRL-based beam management in the massive MIMO systems is studied in this paper. First, a DRL-based beam management scheme has been designed for beyond the fifth generation and the sixth generation (B5G/6G) systems, which can support the collaborative beam selections of multiple panels with low complexity and fast convergence. Second, a system-level simulation platform is developed to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme in B5G/6G systems. Finally, the system-level simulation results are provided, which show that our proposed scheme can achieve much higher spectrum efficiency than the referred evaluation results given by international telecommunication union (ITU).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9569435/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Multi-Panel Beam Management in Massive MIMO Systems: Algorithm Design and System-Level Simulation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Multi-Panel Beam Management in Massive MIMO Systems: Algorithm Design and System-Level Simulation","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570728247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068041S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":9569446,"authors":[{"name":"Thushan Sivalingam","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Thushan","lastName":"Sivalingam"},{"name":"Samad Ali","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Samad","lastName":"Ali"},{"name":"Nurul Huda Mahmood","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Nurul","lastName":"Huda Mahmood"},{"name":"Nandana Rajatheva","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Nandana","lastName":"Rajatheva"},{"name":"Matti Latva-Aho","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Latva-Aho"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569446","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569446","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Performance evaluation","Deep learning","Training","Simulation","Perturbation methods","Neurons"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex spreading","deep learning","grant-free","massive machine-type communication","multi user detection","MUSA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569446","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569446.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Neural Network-Based Blind Multiple User Detection for Grant-free Multi-User Shared Access","abstract":"Multi-user shared access (MUSA) is introduced as advanced code domain non-orthogonal complex spreading sequences to support a massive number of machine-type communications (MTC) devices.

With this partial reciprocity, we propose a multi-path beamforming scheme with a predefined codebook.

The second stage then predicts channel coefficients from this reconstructed signal. A drawback of this algorithm is that certain second moments of the channel statistics are required. In case of high-resolution (no quantization) observations, a recently introduced neural network based approach was able to predict channels even without the use of second order statistics. A low-SNR formulation of the proposed two stage algorithm motivates us to employ the neural network based method also in the case of one-bit quantization. Numerical simulations demonstrate the validity of this approach.

Moreover, non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA)-enabled schemes are promising schemes to realize the target spectral efficiency, low latency, and user fairness requirements in future networks. In this paper, an energy-efficient cooperative NOMA (CNOMA) scheme that guarantees the minimum required rate for the cell-edge users in an indoor THz-MISO communications network is proposed. The proposed cooperative scheme consists of three stages: (i) beamforming stage that allocates base-station (BS) beams to THz cooperating cell-center users using analog beamforming with the aid of the cosine similarity metric, (ii) user pairing stage that is tackled using the Hungarian algorithm, and (iii) power allocation stage for both the BS THz-NOMA transmit power and the cooperation power of the cooperating cell-center users, which are optimized sequentially. The obtained results quantify the energy efficiency (EE) of the proposed scheme and shed new light on the performance of multi-user THz-NOMA-enabled networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569475.pdf","startPage":"483","endPage":"489","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569475","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Coverage Enhancement of Indoor THz-MISO Systems: An FD-NOMA Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Array signal processing","Spectral efficiency","5G mobile communication","Energy efficiency","Resource management","Communication networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","user cooperation","full-duplex (FD)","terahertz (THz) communication","energy efficiency (EE)","beamforming","user pairing","power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Coverage Enhancement of Indoor THz-MISO Systems: An FD-NOMA Approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569475/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004055","fundingName":"King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Coverage Enhancement of Indoor THz-MISO Systems: An FD-NOMA Approach","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570716403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104387S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569480,"authors":[{"name":"Vikram Singh","affiliation":["Center of Excellence in Wireless Technology (CEWiT), Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras)"],"firstName":"Vikram","lastName":"Singh"},{"name":"Abhijeet Abhimanyu Masal","affiliation":["Center of Excellence in Wireless Technology (CEWiT), Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras)"],"firstName":"Abhijeet Abhimanyu","lastName":"Masal"},{"name":"J.

This work proposes a position estimation method using a full dimension massive multiple-input multiple-output (MaMIMO) system in cellular networks. The user equipment (UE) estimates the time of flight/arrival (ToA) from multiple BSs using estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariant technique (ESPRIT). A novel method that selects a subset of the accurate ToA measurements and uses it to estimate the position of the target UE based on multilateration is proposed. The simulation results demonstrate that there is a significant improvement in positioning accuracy over the conventional methods, and the proposed method closely matches the genie-aided algorithm for small subsets, and outperforms it for large subsets. The proposed method achieves 20 cm positioning accuracy for 90% of the UEs in indoor factory (InF) scenarios using practical 3GPP channel models. It also satisfies the ITU requirement for Industry 4.0 and requires a low transmission and measurement overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Precision Positioning using Multi-cell Massive MIMO system for 5G and beyond","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569480","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569480.pdf","startPage":"1234","endPage":"1240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569480","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"High Precision Positioning using Multi-cell Massive MIMO system for 5G and beyond","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569480/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Precision Positioning using Multi-cell Massive MIMO system for 5G and beyond","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570715510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05154S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569480","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569500,"authors":[{"name":"Saud Khan","affiliation":["School of Engineering, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Saud","lastName":"Khan"},{"name":"Salman Durrani","affiliation":["School of Engineering, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Salman","lastName":"Durrani"},{"name":"Xiangyun Zhou","affiliation":["School of Engineering, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Xiangyun","lastName":"Zhou"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569500","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Wireless communication","Maximum likelihood detection","Transfer learning","Estimation","Channel estimation","Detectors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intelligent Reflecting Surface","deep learning","transfer learning","detection"]}],"abstract":"This work investigates the data detection problem in an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) aided downlink communication between a multi-antenna access point (AP) and multiple user equipments (UEs). We utilise a deep learning-based approach, with a maximum likelihood detection (MLD)-based loss function, thereby bypassing the resource-consuming channel training and estimation requirement for detection. The proposed detection framework first trains a base deep neural network (DNN) offline with the simulated samples of the channel coefficients and IRS phase shifts in the IRS-assisted communications scenario. To deal with the significant challenge of the channel getting outdated, domain adaptation under the transfer learning paradigm is leveraged, i.e., the initial layers of the DNN are frozen, and the remaining layers are retrained on a smaller number of the received signal samples online to account for the channel mismatch. Our results show that the proposed detector achieves BER results close to the lower bound and outperforms conventional benchmark techniques, with relatively lower complexity.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569500","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569500.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","startPage":"555","endPage":"560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transfer Learning Based Detection for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transfer Learning Based Detection for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569500/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9569500/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transfer Learning Based Detection for Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Communications","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570713863.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098301S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569512,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Zeng","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Zeng"},{"name":"Lintao Zhang","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Lintao","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Yuliang Tang","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Yuliang","lastName":"Tang"},{"name":"Yanglong Sun","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Yanglong","lastName":"Sun"},{"name":"Yuqi Ruan","affiliation":["Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Yuqi","lastName":"Ruan"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1468-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-1467-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-4754-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2473-9464"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2471-6146"}],"articleNumber":"9569512","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569512","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Connected vehicles","Vehicle-to-infrastructure","Simulation","Heuristic algorithms","Power control","Vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autonomous vehicles","nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","sub-band selection","power control"]}],"abstract":"There exits difficulty in environment sensing for autonomous vehicles in Internet of vehicles (IoV) networks. The autonomous vehicle can obtain a full sense of the environment from connected vehicles by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications and make better decisions for driving safety. However, limited spectrum resources cannot adapt to the increasing number of communication links and the traditional frequency multiplexing will lead to serious co-frequency interference and fail to connect more vehicles. Therefore, we develop a resource allocation scheme through jointly optimizing sub-band selection and power control based on V2X Network. Meanwhile, the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is adopted for multi-V2V communication that shares the spectrum allocated to vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. Considering time-varying channel conditions caused by vehicle movement and power control over a continuous range in a vehicular environment, we investigate a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to maximize the sum transmission rate of the V2I links and V2V links while ensuring the quality of service of V2V links. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed solution can effectively optimize the total throughput.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSE51940.2021.9569512","publicationTitle":"2021 16th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 16th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569243/9569247/09569512.pdf","startPage":"622","endPage":"627","doi":"10.1109/ICCSE51940.2021.9569512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Resource Allocation Based on Reinforcement Learning for NOMA Vehicular Cooperative Communication Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-21 Aug. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Resource Allocation Based on Reinforcement Learning for NOMA Vehicular Cooperative Communication Networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-21 Aug. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9569512/","publicationDate":"17 Aug. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569512/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Resource Allocation Based on Reinforcement Learning for NOMA Vehicular Cooperative Communication Networks","confLoc":"Lancaster, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"332089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047976S","chronDate":"17-21 Aug. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569243","isNumber":"9569247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569243","xplore-issue":"9569247","articleId":"9569512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9569523,"authors":[{"name":"Jean Dion","affiliation":["b<>com, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Dion"},{"name":"Julien Lallet","affiliation":["b<>com, France","Nokia Bell Labs, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Lallet"},{"name":"Laurent Beaulieu","affiliation":["b<>com, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Beaulieu"},{"name":"Patrick Savelli","affiliation":["b<>com, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Savelli"},{"name":"Philippe Bertin","affiliation":["b<>com, France","Orange Labs, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Bertin"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569523","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":9},"abstract":"Cloud Radio Access Network consists in deporting and pooling radio processing on shared servers for a better use of computing resources, more agile operations, and thus optimizing costs and energy performance. Some of these processes at the radio physical layer are highly demanding in terms of computing power, which implies high energy consumption. Our approach enables the automatic activation of hardware programmable acceleration resources that are better suited to these processes in terms of performance and energy efficiency. Low-Density Parity-Check Forward Error Correction functions standardized in 5th Generation of Mobile Networks are offloaded on these hardware acceleration resources. Kubernetes-based orchestration is made compatible with the use of a edge computing accelerated heterogeneous infrastructure (CPU, GPU, FPGA) that can be distributed at the edge of the operator\u2019s network to deploy the RAN Distributed Unit. We assess the proof-of-concept implementation of our approach and evaluate cost in data offloading and energy consumption. This prefigures a full cloud orchestration for 5G access, such as recommended in the O-RAN consortium.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569523.pdf","startPage":"1061","endPage":"1066","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569523","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud Native Hardware Accelerated 5G virtualized Radio Access Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Energy consumption","Costs","Power demand","5G mobile communication","Life estimation","Software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","Cloud RAN","vRAN","FPGA","LDPC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569523/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Cloud Native Hardware Accelerated 5G virtualized Radio Access Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569523/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud Native Hardware Accelerated 5G virtualized Radio Access Network","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570715542.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081687S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569523","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569529,"authors":[{"name":"Zeeshan Sattar","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications, Inc., Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Zeeshan","lastName":"Sattar"},{"name":"Afshin Haghighat","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications, Inc., Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Afshin","lastName":"Haghighat"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569529","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":19},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface waves","Simulation","Phase shifters","Receivers","Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces","Complexity theory","Land mobile radio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable intelligent surface","Millimeter wave","Array gain","6G","Spectral efficiency"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces the concept of a nearly passive reconfigurable intelligent surface where each unit cell can only provide an invariable constant phase-shift.

In this paper, we propose two novel group-based deep neural network active user detection (AUD) schemes for the grant-free sparse code multiple access (SCMA) system in mMTC uplink framework. The proposed AUD schemes learn the nonlinear mapping, i.e., multi-dimensional codebook structure and the channel characteristic. This is accomplished through the received signal which incorporates the sparse structure of device activity with the training dataset. Moreover, the offline pre-trained model is able to detect the active devices without any channel state information and prior knowledge of the device sparsity level. Simulation results show that with several active devices, the proposed schemes obtain more than twice the probability of detection compared to the conventional AUD schemes over the signal to noise ratio range of interest.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569538","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569538.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","startPage":"635","endPage":"641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning-Based Active User Detection for Grant-free SCMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep Learning-Based Active User Detection for Grant-free SCMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569538/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9569538/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep Learning-Based Active User Detection for Grant-free SCMA Systems","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570711901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058109S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569544,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Amidzadeh","affiliation":["Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Amidzadeh"},{"name":"Hanan Al-Tous","affiliation":["Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Hanan","lastName":"Al-Tous"},{"name":"Giuseppe Caire","affiliation":["Communications and Information Theory Chair, TU Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Caire"},{"name":"Olav Tirkkonen","affiliation":["Aalto University, Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Olav","lastName":"Tirkkonen"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569544","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cellular networks","Wireless communication","Multicast algorithms","OFDM","Simulation","Interference","Probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless caching","cache placement and delivery policy","multipoint multicast transmission","resource allocation","inter-carrier interference","inter-block interference"]}],"abstract":"We consider optimal cache placement and delivery for Orthogonal Multipoint Multicasting (OMPMC) cellular systems. In OMPMC, all Base Stations (BSs) that cache a file transmit identical signals in a dedicated frequency resource. The simultaneous transmissions create artificial multipath propagation, which creates Inter-Block Interference (IBI) and Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing systems where the Cyclic Prefix (CP) is shorter than the maximum propagation delay. The placement of files at BS caches is based on a probabilistic model. A file request is in outage if the average signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio associated with a request is less than a threshold. We formulate the cache policy and bandwidth allocation as a joint optimization problem aiming to minimize the total outage probability, and considering the effect of IBI and ICI. Despite that the outage probability does not have a closed form expression, we are able to devise an algorithm to find the optimal solution based on predictor-corrector approach.

In this paper, we analyze the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of planar antenna arrays in Massive MIMO systems for Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation. With the help of Random Matrix Theory, we prove that for Massive antenna arrays with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) multipath signals, instantaneous CRLB for AoA estimation converges toward a deterministic value, regardless of channel distribution. In this scenario, CRLB is a function of channel variance instead of instantaneous realizations. Then, antenna selection is studied, and it is shown that using different subsets significantly affects the CRLB of a planar array. Numerical results confirm the convergence of deterministic results and indicate the benefits of antenna selection and the importance of the selection strategy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of CRLB for AoA estimation in Massive MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569552","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569552.pdf","startPage":"1395","endPage":"1400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569552/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of CRLB for AoA estimation in Massive MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569552/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of CRLB for AoA estimation in Massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570710545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081537S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569556,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Staat","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Staat"},{"name":"Harald Elders-Boll","affiliation":["TH K\u00f6ln \u2013 University of Applied Sciences, Cologne, Germany"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Elders-Boll"},{"name":"Markus Heinrichs","affiliation":["TH K\u00f6ln \u2013 University of Applied Sciences, Cologne, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Heinrichs"},{"name":"Rainer Kronberger","affiliation":["TH K\u00f6ln \u2013 University of Applied Sciences, Cologne, Germany"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Kronberger"},{"name":"Christian Zenger","affiliation":["PHYSEC GmbH, Bochum, Germany","Ruhr University Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Zenger"},{"name":"Christof Paar","affiliation":["Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy, Bochum, Germany"],"firstName":"Christof","lastName":"Paar"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569556","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Quantization (signal)","Prototypes","Public key","Hardware","Entropy","Transceivers"]}],"abstract":"Physical layer key generation is a promising candidate for cryptographic key establishment between two wireless communication parties. It offers information-theoretic security and is an attractive alternative to public-key techniques. Here, the inherent randomness of wireless radio channels is used as a shared entropy source to generate cryptographic key material. However, practical implementations often suffer from static channel conditions which exhibit a limited amount of randomness. In the past, considerable research efforts have been made to address this fundamental limitation. However, current solutions are not generic or require dedicated hardware extensions such as reconfigurable antennas. In this paper, we propose a novel wireless key generation architecture based on randomized channel responses from an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). Due to its passive nature, a cooperative IRS is well-suited to provide randomness for conventional resource-constrained radios. We conduct the first practical studies to successfully demonstrate IRS-based physical-layer key generation with an OFDM system. In a static environment, using a single subcarrier only, our IRS-assisted prototype system achieves a key generation rate (KGR) of 97.39 bps with 6.5% key disagreement rate (KDR) after quantization, while passing standard randomness tests.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569556","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569556.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","startPage":"745","endPage":"751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Wireless Key Generation for Low-Entropy Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Wireless Key Generation for Low-Entropy Environments","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569556/","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9569556/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Wireless Key Generation for Low-Entropy Environments","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570709908.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079072S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569556","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569557,"authors":[{"name":"Hanwen Cao","affiliation":["Munich Research Center, Huawei Technologies D\u00fcsseldorf GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Hanwen","lastName":"Cao"},{"name":"Mate Boban","affiliation":["Munich Research Center, Huawei Technologies D\u00fcsseldorf GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Mate","lastName":"Boban"},{"name":"Josef Eichinger","affiliation":["Munich Research Center, Huawei Technologies D\u00fcsseldorf GmbH, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Eichinger"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569557","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["6G mobile communication","Wireless networks","Attenuation","Throughput","Propagation losses","Resource management","Uplink"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Terahertz (THz)","Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS)","Wireless Propagation","Antenna Array","Wireless Relay"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Terahertz Communications Enhanced by IRS","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569557.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569557","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569557","abstract":"Terahertz (THz) spectrum band has garnered a lot of interest recently, due to the advances in supporting radio electronics and the existence of hundreds of Gigahertz of available spectrum.

To exploit spatial multiplexing, accurate channel estimation through pilot signals is needed. In mMTC systems, it is impractical to allocate a unique orthogonal pilot sequence to each UE as it would require too long pilot sequences, degrading the spectral efficiency. This work addresses the design of channel features from correlated fading channels to assist the pilot assignment in multi-sector mMTC systems under pilot reuse of orthogonal sequences. In order to reduce pilot collisions and to enable pilot reuse, we propose to extract features from the channel covariance matrices that reflect the level of orthogonality between the UEs channels. Two features are investigated: covariance matrix distance (CMD) feature and CMD-aided channel charting (CC) feature. In terms of symbol error rate and achievable rate, the CC-based feature shows superior performance than the CMD-based feature and baseline pilot assignment algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569562","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","startPage":"654","endPage":"659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569562.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spectral efficiency","Partial transmit sequences","Interference","Feature extraction","MIMO","Space division multiplexing","Resource management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Spatial Correlation for Pilot Reuse in Single-Cell mMTC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569562/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569562/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002341","fundingName":"Academy of Finland"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Spatial Correlation for Pilot Reuse in Single-Cell mMTC","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570715898.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082986S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9569579,"authors":[{"name":"Md Jahid Hasan","affiliation":["CNRS, Centrale Marseille, Institut Fresnel Marseille, France Oledcomm SAS, Aix-Marseille University, France"],"firstName":"Md Jahid","lastName":"Hasan"},{"name":"Mohammad Ali Khalighi","affiliation":["CNRS, Centrale Marseille, Institut Fresnel Marseille, Aix-Marseille University, France"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Ali Khalighi"},{"name":"Luis Nero Alves","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es Departamento de Electr\u00f3nica, Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es e Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade de Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Luis Nero","lastName":"Alves"},{"name":"Bastien B\u00e9chadergue","affiliation":["Laboratoire d\u2019Ing\u00e9nierie des-Syst\u00e8mes de Versailles, Universit\u00e9 de Versailles-Saint-Quentin, V\u00e9lizy-Villacoublay, France"],"firstName":"Bastien","lastName":"B\u00e9chadergue"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569579","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Biomedical equipment","Biomedical optical imaging","Radio transmitters","Probability","Adaptive optics","Robustness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless body area networks","optical-orthogonal frequency-division multiple access","synchronization errors","optical wireless communications"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the use of infrared-based optical wireless communications for multi-user uplink wireless body-area networks. We propose the use of optical-orthogonal frequency division multiple access (O-OFDMA) signaling to manage the multiple access (MA) requirement for relatively high-rate medical applications. In particular, we consider asymmetrically clipped O-OFDMA and analyze its performance in terms of bit-error-rate and outage probability in the presence of multi-user time synchronization errors.

In addition, owing to the diversification of applications using WLANs, transmission opportunities have been proportionally greater in the uplink direction, from MSs to base stations (BSs), than ever. Furthermore, most of this data is transmitted using Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Therefore, WLANs need to provide opportunities for frame transmission in each direction according to the ratio of TCP traffic intensity. In this study, we propose a TCP-aware frame transmission method that makes effective use of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) transmission as introduced in the IEEE 802.11ax standard to improve the TCP throughput of the entire WLAN while realizing the allocation of such frame transmission opportunities. In an environment where TCP flows are transmitted in both uplink and downlink directions, the proposed method transmits each frame by using OFDMA transmission and Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) adaptively and selectively according to the buffering status of TCP data segments and ACKs in each direction.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569586.pdf","startPage":"1024","endPage":"1029","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TCP-Aware OFDMA Transmission Based on Traffic Intensity in Downlink and Uplink Directions in IEEE 802.11ax Wireless LANs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","Protocols","OFDM","IEEE 802.11ax Standard","Downlink","Throughput","Resource management"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.11ax","Wireless LAN","OFDMA","TCP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"TCP-Aware OFDMA Transmission Based on Traffic Intensity in Downlink and Uplink Directions in IEEE 802.11ax Wireless LANs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569586/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TCP-Aware OFDMA Transmission Based on Traffic Intensity in Downlink and Uplink Directions in IEEE 802.11ax Wireless LANs","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570711961.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090087S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569589,"authors":[{"name":"Hongjiang Lei","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Hongjiang","lastName":"Lei"},{"name":"Chen Zhu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Zhu"},{"name":"Ki-Hong Park","affiliation":["CEMSE Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ki-Hong","lastName":"Park"},{"name":"Weijia Lei","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Communication Engineering, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Weijia","lastName":"Lei"},{"name":"Imran Shafique Ansari","affiliation":["James Watt School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Imran Shafique","lastName":"Ansari"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569589","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Geometry","NOMA","Three-dimensional displays","Monte Carlo methods","Stochastic processes","Probability","Physical layer security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["physical layer security","nonorthogonal multiple access","secrecy outage probability","unmanned aerial vehicle"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the secure communication performance of nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication systems in presence of aerial eavesdroppers.

IRS has the capability to beamform and relays the received radio signal from the transmitter to the desired receiver. This has made the IRS a promising candidate technology for the beyond fifth-generation (5G) cellular standards. In this work, the performance of an IRS-assisted wireless communication system is investigated and compared with the full-duplex (FD) relay-assisted system in the presence of non-ideal transmitters. Specifically, the performance is compared in terms of channel capacity and energy efficiency (EE). The results show that the IRS can never achieve more capacity than the ideal FD relaying, in the presence of a non-ideal transmitter, irrespective of the placement of IRS and relay. Further increasing the number of REs, the capacity saturates with an upper bound that equals to the capacity provided by the relay-assisted system. However, increasing the number of REs results in the reduction of the EE for IRS-assisted systems, which are otherwise known to be highly energy-efficient.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569598.pdf","startPage":"513","endPage":"518","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces Versus Full-Duplex Relaying: Performance Comparison for Non-Ideal Transmitter Case","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Upper bound","Channel capacity","Radio transmitters","Scattering","Receivers","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intelligent reflecting surface","energy efficiency","decode-and-forward","channel capacity","non-linearity","full-duplex","self-interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces Versus Full-Duplex Relaying: Performance Comparison for Non-Ideal Transmitter Case","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569598/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces Versus Full-Duplex Relaying: Performance Comparison for Non-Ideal Transmitter Case","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570715445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057181S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569615,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Min Lu","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Min","lastName":"Lu"},{"name":"Jang-Ping Sheu","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jang-Ping","lastName":"Sheu"},{"name":"Yung-Ching Kuo","affiliation":["National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Ching","lastName":"Kuo"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569615","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Deep learning","Location awareness","Measurement","Time difference of arrival","Navigation","Neural networks","Predictive models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Indoor positioning","ultra-wideband","fingerprint","deep learning","time difference of arrival"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569615","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569615.pdf","startPage":"1260","endPage":"1266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep Learning for Ultra-Wideband Indoor Positioning","abstract":"In recent years, the Ultra-wideband (UWB) system has been investigated for indoor localization and navigation by academia and industry.

The five features are received signal strength indication (RSSI), time of arrival (ToA), time difference of arrival (TDoA), first path (FP) amplitude from channel impulse response (CIR), and metric Mc (the ratio of the first path amplitude to peak amplitude).

Specifically, the spectrum efficiency maximization problem for hybrid precoding architecture is hard to solve by the single-layer iterative algorithm. The dual-layer penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm has been proposed to address the problem. Although the PDD algorithm achieves significant performance, it requires high computational complexity, which hinders its practical applications in real-time systems. To address this issue, we first propose a novel framework for deep-unfolding, where a dual-layer deep-unfolding neural network (DLDUNN) is formulated. We then apply the proposed frame-work to solve the spectrum efficiency maximization problem for hybrid precoding architecture. An efficient DLDUNN is designed based on unfolding the iterative PDD algorithm into a layer-wise structure. We also introduce some trainable parameters in place of the high-complexity operations. Simulation results show that the DLDUNN presents the performance of the PDD algorithm with remarkably reduced complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569633/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569633/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Precoding Design Based on Dual-Layer Deep-Unfolding Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Precoding Design Based on Dual-Layer Deep-Unfolding Neural Network","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570715477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09222S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":9569646,"authors":[{"name":"Anand Jee","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Jee"},{"name":"Kamal Agrawal","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Kamal","lastName":"Agrawal"},{"name":"Shankar Prakriya","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Shankar","lastName":"Prakriya"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569646","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["NOMA","Base stations","Diversity reception","Probability","Performance gain","Throughput","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)","coordinated direct and relay transmission (CDRT)","amplify-and-forward (AF)","energy efficiency (EE)"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the performance of a new coordinated direct and relay transmission (CDRT) NOMA framework in which a base station (BS) communicates directly to a near user (NU), and through an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay to a far user (FU). In the first signaling phase, the BS transmits superposed symbols to both NU and relay (R), whereas in the second phase R amplifies and re-transmits the signal from the BS. In this framework, the NU optimally combines the signals from BS and R, which gives it a significant performance advantage, and allows it to harness a diversity of two. This serves as an incentive to NU to participate in NOMA signalling to assist the FU. We derive closed form expressions for the outage probability and throughput of NU and FU. We elaborate on how the power allocation and target rates can be optimally chosen so as to maximize the NU throughput while ensuring a desired FU throughput. Computer simulation results validate the improved energy efficiency of the scheme and accuracy of the derived expressions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of a New Framework for Coordinated Direct AF Relay-Aided Downlink NOMA","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569646","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569646.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569646","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569646","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569646/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a New Framework for Coordinated Direct AF Relay-Aided Downlink NOMA","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569646/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a New Framework for Coordinated Direct AF Relay-Aided Downlink NOMA","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570715489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063479S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569676,"authors":[{"name":"Yihua Ma","affiliation":["ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yihua","lastName":"Ma"},{"name":"Zhifeng Yuan","affiliation":["ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhifeng","lastName":"Yuan"},{"name":"Weimin Li","affiliation":["ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Weimin","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Zhigang Li","affiliation":["ZTE Corporation, Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Zhigang","lastName":"Li"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569676","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569676","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Simulation","Loading","Massive MIMO","Intercell interference","Optimization","Periodic structures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grant-free","massive MIMO","multi-pilot","contention-based","mMTC"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569676","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569676.pdf","startPage":"703","endPage":"707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Irregular Superimposed Multi-pilot for Grant-free Massive MIMO","abstract":"Massive MIMO provides a high spatial degree of freedom (DoF) to support multiple users.

In practice, mmWave signals suffer from small-scale fading, which degrades UE localization. Moreover, mmWave MIMO-based UE localization is a non-convex optimization problem, and the bruteforce application of conventional optimization methods will result in a poor solution or lead to large computational cost. In order to address the above challenges, we propose a novel simultaneous localization and channel estimate (SLCE) algorithm, where the UE location parameters and small-scale fading coefficients are jointly optimized. In such a case, the disturbance of small-scale fading on UE localization is alleviated. Thanks to our problem-specific update rule design, the proposed SLCE algorithm achieves a large performance gain over existing baseline methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569680.pdf","startPage":"1208","endPage":"1214","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Localization and Channel Estimation for 5G mmWave MIMO Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Location awareness","Fading channels","5G mobile communication","Millimeter wave technology","Channel estimation","Optimization methods","Performance gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Localization","5G mmWave MIMO communications","channel estimate","small-scale channel fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Localization and Channel Estimation for 5G mmWave MIMO Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569680/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Localization and Channel Estimation for 5G mmWave MIMO Communications","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570711531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083049S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569685,"authors":[{"name":"Vidit Saxena","affiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden","Ericsson Research, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Vidit","lastName":"Saxena"},{"name":"Hugo Tullberg","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Hugo","lastName":"Tullberg"},{"name":"Joakim Jald\u00e9n","affiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Joakim","lastName":"Jald\u00e9n"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569685","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569685","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Fading channels","Adaptation models","Computational modeling","Modulation","Interference","Throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Link Adaptation","Modulation and Coding Scheme","Multi-armed bandits","Reinforcement Learning","Cellular Networks","Rate Sampling"]}],"abstract":"Wireless links use adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) to optimize data transmission over a dynamic channel. Traditional AMC schemes rely on simple heuristics to track the instantaneous channel state. While attractive for their low implementation and operational complexity, these schemes are known to be suboptimal in a large range of operating environments. Further, several such schemes require careful parameter tuning, which can be both expensive and error-prone. In this paper, we propose latent Thompson sampling (LTS) for AMC, which efficiently tracks the wireless channel by modeling a latent, low-dimensional, channel state. LTS features both a low computational complexity and fast learning dynamics, and requires minimal tuning effort. We evaluate LTS in stationary as well as fading wireless channels, where LTS improves the link throughput by up to 100% compared to state-of-the-art schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569685","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569685.pdf","startPage":"610","endPage":"616","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Based Adaptive Modulation and Coding with Latent Thompson Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Model-Based Adaptive Modulation and Coding with Latent Thompson Sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9569685/","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569685/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Based Adaptive Modulation and Coding with Latent Thompson Sampling","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570711823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060449S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-26"},{"_id":9569713,"authors":[{"name":"Duc-Dung Tran","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Duc-Dung","lastName":"Tran"},{"name":"Shree Krishna Sharma","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Shree Krishna","lastName":"Sharma"},{"name":"Symeon Chatzinotas","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Symeon","lastName":"Chatzinotas"},{"name":"Isaac Woungang","affiliation":["Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Isaac","lastName":"Woungang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569713","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":12},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Codes","System performance","Simulation","Land mobile radio","Convergence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mMTC","SCMA","Q-Learning","short-packet communications"]}],"abstract":"In massive machine-type communications (mMTC) networks, the ever-growing number of MTC devices and the limited radio resources have caused a severe problem of random access channel (RACH) congestion. To mitigate this issue, several potential multiple access (MA) mechanisms including sparse code MA (SCMA) have been proposed. Besides, the short-packet transmission feature of MTC devices requires the design of new transmission and congestion avoidance techniques as the existing techniques based on the assumption of infinite data-packet length may not be suitable for mMTC networks. Therefore, it is important to find novel solutions to address RACH congestion in mMTC networks while considering SCMA and short-packet communications (SPC). In this paper, we propose an SCMA-based random access (RA) method, in which Q-learning is utilized to dynamically allocate the SCMA codebooks and time-slot groups to MTC devices with the aim of minimizing the RACH congestion in SPC-based mMTC networks. To clarify the benefits of our proposed method, we compare its performance with those of the conventional RA methods with/without Q-learning in terms of RA efficiency and evaluate its convergence. Our simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in overloaded systems, i.e., the number of devices is higher than the number of available RA slots. Moreover, we illustrate the sum rate comparison between SPC and long-packet communications (LPC) when applying the proposed method to achieve more insights on SPC.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Q-Learning-Based SCMA for Efficient Random Access in mMTC Networks With Short Packets","publicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569713","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 IEEE 32nd Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569244/9569245/09569713.pdf","startPage":"1334","endPage":"1338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC50174.2021.9569713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Q-Learning-Based SCMA for Efficient Random Access in mMTC Networks With Short Packets","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569713/","dateOfInsertion":"22 October 2021","publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Q-Learning-Based SCMA for Efficient Random Access in mMTC Networks With Short Packets","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"1570715241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051121S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569244","isNumber":"9569245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569244","xplore-issue":"9569245","articleId":"9569713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569717,"authors":[{"name":"Deshi Ye","affiliation":["College of Computer Science Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Deshi","lastName":"Ye"},{"name":"Songyang Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Songyang","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Can Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Can","lastName":"Wang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7586-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-7281-7587-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-9589"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2166-9570"}],"articleNumber":"9569717","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Greedy algorithms","Processor scheduling","Bandwidth","Channel allocation","Collaborative work","Delays","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Federated learning","Wireless Network","Client Selection","Algorithm Design"]}],"abstract":"Device selection is a central issue for federated learning (FL) in a network with limited bandwidth resources, e.g., OFDMA.

But their solution does not guarantee optimality and the computational complexity of the problem remains open. To address this issue, we propose a new algorithm that optimally solves this problem in polynomial-time by casting it into a joint cardinality-constrained device selection and bandwidth allocation problem.

However, edge/mobile devices contain only limited computation capability with battery power, so an energy-efficient DNN training processor is necessary to realize on-device training. Although there are a lot of surveys on energy-efficient DNN inference hardware, the training is quite different from the inference. Therefore, analysis and optimization techniques targeting DNN training are required. This article aims to provide an overview of energy-efficient DNN processing that enables on-device training. Specifically, it will provide hardware optimization techniques to overcomes the design challenges in terms of distinct dataflow, external memory access, and computation. In addition, this paper summarizes key schemes of recent energy-efficient DNN training ASICs. Moreover, we will also show a design example of DNN training ASIC with energy-efficient optimization techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Overview of Energy-Efficient Hardware Accelerators for On-Device Deep-Neural-Network Training","publicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Solid-State Circuits Society","doi":"10.1109/OJSSCS.2021.3119554","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Open Journal of the Solid-State Circuits Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/8782712/8816720/09569757.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OJSSCS.2021.3119554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8816720","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569757/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","chronOrPublicationDate":"2021","displayDocTitle":"An Overview of Energy-Efficient Hardware Accelerators for On-Device Deep-Neural-Network Training","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/9569757/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2021","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2021","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010418","fundingName":"Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) grant"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Korea Government (MSIP, On-Device Instant Learning Complex Intelligence Processor Architecture and ADAS Design for Self-Driving Platform)","grantNumber":"2019-0-01372"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Overview of Energy-Efficient Hardware Accelerators for On-Device Deep-Neural-Network Training","sourcePdf":"ojsscs-lee-3119554-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148113S","chronDate":"2021","xplore-pub-id":"8782712","isNumber":"8816720","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8782712","xplore-issue":"8816720","articleId":"9569757","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":9569808,"authors":[{"name":"Bernardo Sata","affiliation":["ISAE-SUPAERO, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Bernardo","lastName":"Sata","id":"37089003758"},{"name":"Aizar Berlanga","affiliation":["ISAE-SUPAERO, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Aizar","lastName":"Berlanga","id":"37089004666"},{"name":"Caroline P.

The main advantage lies in the fact that it can draw fine distinctions, patterns, or hidden information of data explicitly without complex mathematical considerations. This study aimed to use the neural network on regression problem to achieve a better performance with a lower computational cost. After constructing the initial architecture, we added randomized weights and biases to the model. The performance of the model is evaluated on a well-known benchmark regression dataset named Auto MPG. The datasets were split among train, validation, and testing in a ratio of 50%-30%-20%. After subsequent tuning of hyperparameters, the refined architecture was able to perform predicting regression variable with a great efficiency and less computational time. The metrics of accuracy were taken as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage of error (MAPE). Comparative study with the others state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms reveals the effectiveness of the proposed ANN. Evaluating the experimental results, it was obvious that, most often ANN did lead the other approaches with all the metrics of accuracy with a least computational time. It is also seen that, in some cases, though ANN revealed a very competitive result with other approaches, however the reduction in computational cost overcame the drawbacks and put neural network in leading.","doi":"10.1109/SMC53803.2021.9569881","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 5th Annual Systems Modelling Conference (SMC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569842/9569864/09569881.pdf","publicationTitle":"2021 5th Annual Systems Modelling Conference (SMC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMC53803.2021.9569881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of Artificial Neural Network on Regression Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Measurement","Computational modeling","Artificial neural networks","Computer architecture","Predictive models","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["regression analysis","artificial neural network","backpropagation","deep learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Sept. 2021","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Artificial Neural Network on Regression Analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/9569881/","publicationDate":"14 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","conferenceDate":"14-15 Sept. 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of Artificial Neural Network on Regression Analysis","confLoc":"Canberra, Australia","sourcePdf":"02_PID326711.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078277S","chronDate":"14-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569842","isNumber":"9569864","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569842","xplore-issue":"9569864","articleId":"9569881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":9569921,"authors":[{"name":"Guilin Deng","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Technology, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Guilin","lastName":"Deng","id":"37088941821"},{"name":"Yang Zeng","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Technology, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37087137829"},{"name":"Qi Yang","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Technology, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088217880"},{"name":"Zhaoyang Ma","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Technology, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoyang","lastName":"Ma","id":"37088941396"},{"name":"Bin Deng","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science and Technology, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Deng","id":"37409498100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3853-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-6654-3854-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2639-4537"},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISSN","value":"2639-4545"}],"articleNumber":"9569921","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid modeling","Three-dimensional displays","Fast Fourier transforms","Frequency-domain analysis","Millimeter wave technology","Imaging","Terahertz materials"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["1D MIMO","3D Imaging","Non-Uniform Scanning","non-uniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT)"]}],"abstract":"In short-range millimeter-wave (MMW) 3D imaging applications, scanning 1-D multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array shows the advantages in low cost and fast data acquisition comparing to traditional single-input-single-output (SISO) and 2D MIMO techniques.

Simulation and experimental results show significant improvement in imaging efficiency comparing to traditional methods such as back projection (BP) algorithm, while maintaining the imaging quality.","doi":"10.1109/UCMMT53364.2021.9569921","publicationTitle":"2021 14th UK-Europe-China Workshop on Millimetre-Waves and Terahertz Technologies (UCMMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2021 14th UK-Europe-China Workshop on Millimetre-Waves and Terahertz Technologies (UCMMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/9569843/9569839/09569921.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UCMMT53364.2021.9569921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9569839","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D Imaging Algorithm for Non-Uniform Scanning 1D MIMO Array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569921","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3D Imaging Algorithm for Non-Uniform Scanning 1D MIMO Array","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569921/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"13 Sept. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2021","htmlLink":"/document/9569921/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61971427"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Imaging Algorithm for Non-Uniform Scanning 1D MIMO Array","confLoc":"Lancaster, United Kingdom","sourcePdf":"2021210523_Deng_49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036962S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2021","xplore-pub-id":"9569843","isNumber":"9569839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"9569843","xplore-issue":"9569839","articleId":"9569921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-05"},{"_id":9569951,"authors":[{"name":"Chua-Chin Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Undersea Technology (IUT), National Sun Yat-sen University (NSYSU), Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/9627316/9569951/wang-3115970-small.gif","p":["Chua-Chin Wang (Senior Member, IEEE) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY, USA, in 1992.","Since 1998, he has been a Full Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University (NSYSU), Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

proprietary technologies. This prevents transformation toward Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet of Things. Open platform communications unified architecture (OPC UA) is a standardized protocol that addresses these problems with uniform and semantic communication across all levels of the hierarchy. However, its adoption in embedded field devices, such as sensors and actuators, is still lacking due to prohibitive memory and power requirements of software implementations. We have developed a dedicated hardware engine that offloads processing of the OPC UA protocol and enables the realization of compact and low-power field devices with OPC UA support. As part of a proof-of-concept embedded system, we have implemented this engine in a 22-nm FDSOI technology, representing the first ASIC implementation of an OPC UA server. We measured performance, power consumption, and memory footprint of our test chip and compared it with a software implementation based on open62541 and a Raspberry Pi 2B. Our OPC UA hardware engine is 50 times more energy efficient and only requires 36 KiB of memory. The complete system consumes only 24 mW under full load, making it suitable for low-power embedded applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9594522/09569952.pdf","startPage":"1998","endPage":"2002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3117401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3117401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Implementation of an OPC UA Server for Industrial Field Devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Software","Random access memory","Hardware","Servers","Semiconductor device measurement","Semantics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FDSOI","field devices","industrial automation","Internet of Things","open platform communications unified architecture (OPC UA)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Implementation of an OPC UA Server for Industrial Field Devices","volume":"29","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/9569952/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002347","fundingName":"Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany BMBF in the Fast Semantics Project","grantNumber":"FKZ: 03ZZ0521D"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Implementation of an OPC UA Server for Industrial Field Devices","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-bauer-3117401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060543S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9594522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9594522","articleId":"9569952","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":9569953,"authors":[{"name":"Yingchun Lu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Applied Physics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yingchun","lastName":"Lu","orcid":"0000-0002-2621-0933"},{"name":"Xinyu Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Applied Physics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xinyu","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-3676-2408"},{"name":"Yanjie Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Applied Physics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yanjie","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-6700-9275"},{"name":"Yuan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Applied Physics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Liang Yao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Applied Physics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Yao","orcid":"0000-0002-4081-6499"},{"name":"Maoxiang Yi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Applied Physics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Maoxiang","lastName":"Yi","orcid":"0000-0002-5160-0933"},{"name":"Zhengfeng Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Applied Physics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zhengfeng","lastName":"Huang","orcid":"0000-0001-8695-4478"},{"name":"Huaguo Liang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Applied Physics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Huaguo","lastName":"Liang","orcid":"0000-0002-0307-7236"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"9569953","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"abstract":"This study presents a pure digital scalable mixed entropy separation structure for the physical unclonable function (PUF) and true random number generator (TRNG), which is implemented on Xilinx field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The mixed entropy separation structure in this study is to solve the problems of unstable output in the existing PUF structure and the poor scalability of the TRNG and PUF design. The proposed design has the following innovations: 1) concept of sensitive entropy and the corresponding processing method are proposed for the first time; 2) design does not need to modify the internal design of the entropy source, and it is suitable for most entropy source arrays; and 3) adjustable PUF bit width and TRNG throughput enhance the scalability of the architecture under different requirements. The structure is simulated and validated on two Xilinx FPGAs and tested under nominal working conditions. The results show that the 512-bit PUF entropy source after treatment is 92.7% more stable than the 1024-bit entropy source before treatment, the random number after treatment passes all types of randomness tests, and the minimum entropy is more than 0.8. Under various conditions within the ranges of 0 \u00b0C\u201380 \u00b0C and 0.8\u20131.2 V, the TRNG output remains stable after treatment; the maximum intra-Hamming distance of the treated PUF is 5.1028%, and the average intra-Hamming distance is 2.7065%.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9594522/09569953.pdf","startPage":"1922","endPage":"1929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3116104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3116104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pure Digital Scalable Mixed Entropy Separation Structure for Physical Unclonable Function and True Random Number Generator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Physical unclonable function","Field programmable gate arrays","Throughput","Generators","Scalability","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical unclonable function (PUF)","scalability","sensitive entropy","true random number generator (TRNG)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Pure Digital Scalable Mixed Entropy Separation Structure for Physical Unclonable Function and True Random Number Generator","volume":"29","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/9569953/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"62027815, 61834006 and 61874156"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology on Analog Integrated Circuit Laboratory","grantNumber":"6142802200506"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pure Digital Scalable Mixed Entropy Separation Structure for Physical Unclonable Function and True Random Number Generator","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-liang-3116104-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071092S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9594522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9594522","articleId":"9569953","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":9569954,"authors":[{"name":"Yongwoon Song","affiliation":["Sogang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Yongwoon","lastName":"Song","orcid":"0000-0003-4392-1603"},{"name":"Jooyoung Hwang","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Ltd., Hwaseong-si, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jooyoung","lastName":"Hwang"},{"name":"Insoon Jo","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Ltd., Hwaseong-si, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Insoon","lastName":"Jo"},{"name":"Hyukjun Lee","affiliation":["Sogang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hyukjun","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0003-2981-0800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"9569954","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"abstract":"Internet routers/switches are vulnerable to system failures which require a power reset. Tremendous efforts are made to guarantee the high availability of the systems. A recent work shows that a phase change memory (PCM)-based routing lookup table can achieve high availability in the destination lookup of routers/switches. However, a packet buffer in routers/switches cannot benefit from the lookup table approach because it requires a much larger and higher-bandwidth memory system and its memory traffic is equally divided into reads and writes, while routing table accesses are mostly read-dominant. PCM can provide high availability even when the system undergoes a power reset but exhibits unacceptable write bandwidth. In this work, we propose a magnetic RAM (MRAM)/PCM-based hybrid memory packet buffer and a packet mapping method. A small MRAM combined with a large PCM can outperform the dynamic random access memory (DRAM)-based packet buffer by 28.5% or 22.4% on average for internet-mix packet traffic when optimizing only bandwidth or both bandwidth and lifetime. The proposed adaptive packet mapping method maps small packets less than a predetermined packet size threshold to MRAM for maximizing PCM bandwidth as small packets degrade row buffer locality in PCM. In addition, the mapping method dynamically changes the packet size threshold to capture the working set of packet buffering, which significantly improves PCM lifetime.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/9594522/09569954.pdf","startPage":"2008","endPage":"2012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3116272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2021.3116272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9594522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9569954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly Available Packet Buffer Design With Hybrid Nonvolatile Memory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","Bandwidth","Random access memory","Routing","Buffer storage","Packet loss","Nonvolatile memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High availability","hybrid memory","nonvolatile memory","packet buffer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/9569954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2021","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2021","displayDocTitle":"Highly Available Packet Buffer Design With Hybrid Nonvolatile Memory","volume":"29","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/9569954/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2021","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004358","fundingName":"Samsung Electronics Company Ltd."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly Available Packet Buffer Design With Hybrid Nonvolatile Memory","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-lee-3116272-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056192S","chronDate":"Nov.  2021","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"9594522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"9594522","articleId":"9569954","onlineDate":"13 October 2021","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2021","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"}]
