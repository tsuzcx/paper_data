Wetlands remote sensing classification based on ANN is difficult, because of the complex feature of wetlands areas. The purity of training samples for remote sensing image supervised classification is difficult to guarantee that will affect the classification results based on ANN. This article proposed a method for sample purification based on statistical analysis theory which could purify training samples for improved wetlands remote sensing classification based on ANN. The BP ANN with a nonlinear mapping function can give good classification results for complex areas. We selected a TM image of Honghe Wetlands National Nature Reserve as study material. First, we used the statistical analysis theory to remove noise in training samples; second, we used the original samples and purified samples to train the BP ANN separately, and produced two classification maps of TM image based on two trained BP ANN; finally, we compared the classification accuracy between the two maps. The results showed that BP ANN trained with purification sample improved the wetlands classification accuracy significantly.","doi":"10.1109/CMCE.2010.5610049","pdfPath":"/iel5/5598246/5609936/05610049.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"20","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer, Mechatronics, Control and Electronic Engineering","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer, Mechatronics, Control and Electronic Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMCE.2010.5610049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5609936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Remote sensing image classification based on artificial neural network: A case study of Honghe Wetlands National Nature Reserve","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Remote sensing image classification based on artificial neural network: A case study of Honghe Wetlands National Nature Reserve","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11613975","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5610049/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remote sensing image classification based on artificial neural network: A case study of Honghe Wetlands National Nature Reserve","confLoc":"Changchun","sourcePdf":"017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063274S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5598246","isNumber":"5609936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5598246","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5609936","articleId":"5610049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5610050,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangping Cai","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Modem Measurement & Control Technology of Ministry of Education, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiangping Cai","id":"37290731800"},{"name":"Dong Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Modem Measurement & Control Technology of Ministry of Education, Beijing Information Science and Technology University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Dong Li","id":"37535504500"},{"name":"Anmin Wang","affiliation":["Research of Electronic Information Science and Technology, Tongfang Electronic and Science Company Limited, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Anmin Wang","id":"37290539100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7958-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7957-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7955-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6026"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6034"}],"articleNumber":"5610050","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling methods","signal processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniform sampling signal","nonuniform sampling digital signal processing","frequency detection","nonuniform sampling wavelet transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["nonuniform sampling","spectrum analysis","wavelet transformation"]}],"abstract":"A nonuniform sampling digital signal processing method based on wavelet transform and its application in the frequency detection studied in this paper.

In this paper, an adaptive cross-layer scheme (Beamforming-MIMO) for multi-user system is proposed, which combine multilevel adaptive modulation (AM) at physical layer with truncated automatic repeat request (ARQ) and multi-user diversity at data link layer, and feed backing modulation mode, ARQ request and transmit weight vector from receiver. This paper derives close-form expressions of the system spectral efficiency under outdated feedback. It shows by simulation that for single-user system, compared to other cross-layer schemes, the proposed cross-layer scheme can achieve better performance.

The classification relies on tracking the ridges, which are near the core, by analyzing the block dir image. According to the termination information and the deflexion information of the dermal ridge, each fingerprint will be given one type at least and three types at most by the confidence level. For the five-class problem in the 400 images database the accuracy rate of 99.5% is achieved. Experimental results show the feasibility and validity of the proposed approach in fingerprint classification.","doi":"10.1109/CMCE.2010.5610327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5610241","startPage":"281","endPage":"284","pdfPath":"/iel5/5598246/5610241/05610327.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer, Mechatronics, Control and Electronic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer, Mechatronics, Control and Electronic Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMCE.2010.5610327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of the Incomplete Fingerprint Image","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","fingerprint identification","image classification","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fingerprint image","AFIS database","fingerprint classification","embedded system","block dir image","dermal ridge","automatic fingerprint identification system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["classification","fingerprint","Incomplete image"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Classification of the Incomplete Fingerprint Image","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610327/","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5610327/","accessionNumber":"11598834","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of the Incomplete Fingerprint Image","confLoc":"Changchun","sourcePdf":"281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054239S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5598246","isNumber":"5610241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5598246","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5610241","articleId":"5610327","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":5610333,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Bo Wang","affiliation":["National ASIC Sys.

It is applied as the rotor position estimator in the Switched Reluctance Motors (SRMs) whose characteristic is highly nonlinear. However, the conventional BP NN based rotor position estimator was inappropriate to be implemented in real-time application at high speed operations, because of its considerable computational time consumption in hidden layer. In this paper, a novel BP NN based estimator with pre-treatment is proposed, which considerably simplifies the original neural network structure. It achieves a 40.2% computational burden reduction while staying at the same accuracy as the conventional one. Sensorless control algorithm is also put forward and simulated in order to testify the proposed sensorless estimator and control strategy.","doi":"10.1109/CMCE.2010.5610333","pdfPath":"/iel5/5598246/5610241/05610333.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"307","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer, Mechatronics, Control and Electronic Engineering","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer, Mechatronics, Control and Electronic Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMCE.2010.5610333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5610241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Position sensorless control of SRMs based on novel BP Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Position sensorless control of SRMs based on novel BP Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11598840","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5610333/","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Position sensorless control of SRMs based on novel BP Neural Network","confLoc":"Changchun, China","sourcePdf":"304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049139S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5598246","isNumber":"5610241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5598246","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5610241","articleId":"5610333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5610348,"authors":[{"name":"Li Xiao li","affiliation":["Engineering College, Northeast Agriculture University, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Li Xiao li","id":"38253664100"},{"name":"Cui Tian shi","affiliation":["Engineering College, Northeast Agriculture University, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Cui Tian shi","id":"38258694500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7958-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7957-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7955-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6026"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6034"}],"articleNumber":"5610348","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5610348","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Algorithm design and analysis","Acceleration","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","path planning","service robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path planning","fruit picking robot","genetic algorithm","joint velocity","acceleration restriction","robotics toolbox"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["robot","path planning","robotics toolbox","Genetic Algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CMCE.2010.5610348","pdfPath":"/iel5/5598246/5610241/05610348.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer, Mechatronics, Control and Electronic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer, Mechatronics, Control and Electronic Engineering","startPage":"248","endPage":"251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5610241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMCE.2010.5610348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path planning of fruit picking robot based on genetic algorithm","abstract":"Taking the shortest distance as the performance index and the 6-DOF fruit picking robot as the research object, the various points of path that robot passed are planned with the genetic algorithm, considering the joint velocity, acceleration and acceleration restriction.

By incorporating additional inequality constraints, this paper presents the modified SVM-based cost function and illustrates how it can be used to linear beamforming.

The error between measurement and given value of generator power is given as the input of the controller. RBFNN is used to be the identifier, giving an identification to pitch system and obtaining the identification information of the system. According to the identification information, the gradient descent method is used to updating the PID Parameters, realizing PID parameters self-tuning. Simulation Model of 1MW variable pitch WPGS is built in MATLB/SIMULINK toolbox and simulation experiments of both the proposed controller and traditional PID controller are carried out under a random wind speed.

Numerical test is carried out by the extended BFGS method and the others learning method of BP Neural Network, and comparisons of the results demonstrate that the new algorithm is better than the others in numerical stability and convergence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610472/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5610472/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11598382","conferenceDate":"24-26 Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"The study of learning algorithm the BP Neural Network based on extended BFGS method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The study of learning algorithm the BP Neural Network based on extended BFGS method","confLoc":"Changchun, China","sourcePdf":"208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086782S","chronDate":"24-26 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5598246","isNumber":"5609592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5598246","xplore-issue":"5609592","articleId":"5610472","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5610491,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan-Cheng Zou","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Changchun University of Technology, Changchun, China"],"lastName":"Kuan-Cheng Zou","id":"37588173000"},{"name":"Li-Li Bing","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Changchun University of Technology, Changchun, China"],"lastName":"Li-Li Bing","id":"38258352100"},{"name":"Yan-Bin Yang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Changchun University of Technology, Changchun, China"],"lastName":"Yan-Bin Yang","id":"38256768800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7958-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7957-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7955-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6026"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6034"}],"articleNumber":"5610491","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5610491","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","neural nets","rough set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","rough set theory","BP network structure","redundant attribute","rough set attribute reduction theory","conjugate gradient algorithm","momentum technique","batch technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rough set","BP network","reduction","training samples"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CMCE.2010.5610491","pdfPath":"/iel5/5598246/5609592/05610491.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer, Mechatronics, Control and Electronic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Computer, Mechatronics, Control and Electronic Engineering","startPage":"282","endPage":"285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5609592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CMCE.2010.5610491","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The neural network based on rough set theory","abstract":"In order to simplify the complexity of the BP network structure and reduce the time of training samples.

Large areas of plate structures can be monitored using active arrays employing beamforming techniques. Dispersion and multiple propagating modes are issues that need to be addressed when working with Lamb waves. Previous work has mainly focused on standard delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming while reducing the effects of multiple modes through frequency selectivity and transducer design. This paper presents a minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) approach for Lamb waves using a uniform rectangular array (URA) and a single transmitter. Theoretically calculated dispersion curves are used to compensate for dispersion. The combination of the MVDR approach and the two-dimensional array improves the suppression of interfering Lamb modes. The proposed approach is evaluated on simulated and experimental data and compared with the standard DAS beamformer. It is shown that the MVDR algorithm performs better in terms of higher resolution and better side lobe and mode suppression capabilities. Known issues of the MVDR approach, such as signal cancellation in highly correlated environments and poor robustness, are addressed using methods that have proven effective for the purpose in other fields of active imaging.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1745","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5610539/05610557.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5610539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","startPage":"2712","endPage":"2724","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive beamforming for array imaging of plate structures using lamb waves","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5610557","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 December 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive beamforming for array imaging of plate structures using lamb waves","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610557/","volume":"57","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5610557/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2010","accessionNumber":"11693311","pubMedId":"21156367","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive beamforming for array imaging of plate structures using lamb waves","sourcePdf":"t10c2712.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066609S","chronDate":"December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5610539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5610539","articleId":"5610557","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5610586,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Alhamad","affiliation":["Digital Ecosystems and Business Intelligence Institute, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Alhamad","id":"37593987400"},{"name":"Tharam Dillon","affiliation":["Digital Ecosystems and Business Intelligence Institute, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Tharam","lastName":"Dillon","id":"37266670100"},{"name":"Elizabeth Chang","affiliation":["Digital Ecosystems and Business Intelligence Institute, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Chang","id":"37274693400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5553-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5551-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5552-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-4946"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-4938"},{"format":"CD","value":"2150-4938"}],"articleNumber":"5610586","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":126,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3220},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5610586","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Cloud computing","Measurement","Contracts","Monitoring","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","contracts","customer services","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conceptual SLA framework","cloud computing","online service","service level agreement","service provider","online contract","negotiation strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SLA","Negotiation","Cloud computing","Trust management"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing has been a hot topic in the research community since 2007. In cloud computing, the online services are conducted to be pay-as-you-use. Service customers need not be in a long term contract with service providers. Service level agreements (SLAs) are agreements signed between a service provider and another party such as a service consumer, broker agent, or monitoring agent. Because cloud computing is a recent technology providing many services for critical business applications, reliable and flexible mechanisms to manage online contracts are very important. This paper presents the main criteria which should be considered at the stage of designing the SLA in cloud computing. Also, we investigate the negotiation strategies between cloud provider and cloud consumer and propose our method to maintain the trust and reliability between each of the parties involved in the negotiation process.","publicationTitle":"4th IEEE International Conference on Digital Ecosystems and Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"4th IEEE International Conference on Digital Ecosystems and Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5599959/5610579/05610586.pdf","startPage":"606","endPage":"610","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEST.2010.5610586","doi":"10.1109/DEST.2010.5610586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5610579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Conceptual SLA framework for cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Conceptual SLA framework for cloud computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610586/","conferenceDate":"13-16 April 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5610586/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2010","publicationDate":"April 2010","accessionNumber":"11599448","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 April 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Conceptual SLA framework for cloud computing","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"TF003115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11265S","chronDate":"13-16 April 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5599959","isNumber":"5610579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5599959","citationCount":"126","xplore-issue":"5610579","articleId":"5610586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5610615,"authors":[{"name":"Markus M.

Finite-element technique that combines time-dependent magnetic field with mass transfer of species is employed for quantifying the effect of convection, diffusion, and magnetic field on the mixing performance. It is shown that it is possible to generate periodic magnetic forces that can make the MNPs oscillate in different directions. This oscillation of MNPs causes agitation in the surrounding fluid thus improving the mixing in the microfluidic system. Effects of MNP size, inlet velocity of the fluid entering the system, and switching frequency of magnetic field are investigated. Mixing efficiency analysis result shows that in order to have an effective MNP-based mixing, an optimum switching frequency is required that not only depends on applied magnetic field but also on convective flow velocity, channel's dimension, and nanoparticle size. It is also observed that if the switching frequency is much higher or lower than the optimum switching frequency, then MNPs add limited disturbance to the fluid flow and do not significantly enhances the mixing. Moreover, the optimum switching frequency and the inlet flow velocity is also scalable. Furthermore, when MNP actuated mixing is compared with passive mixing strategies, it is found to be more efficient. The simulation performed in this paper using the multiphysics model provides an excellent estimate of the potential to use time-dependent magnetic actuation technique for efficiently mixing or tagging MNPs with target biomolecules on-chip for further analysis. The model will also be very useful in investigating a wide range of design parameters for designing and fabricating efficient integrated lab-on-a-chip devices for point-of-care applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel5/7729/6011606/05610729.pdf","startPage":"953","endPage":"961","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2010.2089802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2010.2089802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011606","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5610729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of a Magnetic Nanoparticle-Enhanced Mixing in a Microfluidic System Using Time-Dependent Magnetic Field","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Magnetic fields","Nanoparticles","Microchannel","Equations","Magnetic liquids","Fluids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convection","finite element analysis","lab-on-a-chip","magnetic particles","microfluidics","nanoparticles","particle size"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic nanoparticle-enhanced mixing","microfluidic system","time-dependent magnetic field","finite-element technique","mass transfer","convection","diffusion","inlet velocity","switching frequency","nanoparticle size","passive mixing strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lab-on-a-chip","magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs)","magnetism","mathematical modeling","microfluidics","mixing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of a Magnetic Nanoparticle-Enhanced Mixing in a Microfluidic System Using Time-Dependent Magnetic Field","volume":"10","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5610729/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12216296","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of a Magnetic Nanoparticle-Enhanced Mixing in a Microfluidic System Using Time-Dependent Magnetic Field","sourcePdf":"tnano-zhou-2089802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122854S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6011606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6011606","articleId":"5610729","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5610731,"authors":[{"name":"Anshuman Shukla","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research Center, Vasteras, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5959286/5610731/5610731-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anshuman Shukla (S\u201904\u2013M\u201909) received the Bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from Muzaffarpur Institute of Technology, Muzaffarpur, India, in 2001 and the M.Tech. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India, in 2003 and 2008, respectively.","Since September 2008, he has been with ABB Corporate Research, Vasteras, Sweden.

With the phase-shifted carrier-based scheme, natural balancing can be achieved in a straightforward manner. However, to achieve natural balancing with the harmonically optimal phase-disposition (PD) carrier-based scheme, the conventional approaches require (n - 1) \u00d7 (n - 1) trapezoidal carrier signals for an n-level inverter, which is ( n - 1) \u00d7 (n - 2) times more than that in the standard PD scheme. This paper proposes two improved natural balancing strategies for FCMI under PD scheme, which use the same (n - 1) carrier signals as used in the standard PD scheme. In the first scheme, the on-line detections are performed of (i) the band in which the modulation signal is located, (ii) corresponding period number of the carrier, and (iii) rising or falling half cycle of the carrier waveform to generate the switching signals based on certain rules. In the second strategy, the output voltage level selection is first processed and the switching signals are then generated according to a rule based on preferential cell selection algorithm. These methods are easy to use and can be simply implemented as compared to the other available methods. Simulation and experimental results are presented for a five-level inverter to verify these proposed schemes.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2089807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5959286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5959286/05610731.pdf","endPage":"1693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Natural Balancing of Flying Capacitor Voltages in Multicell Inverter Under PD Carrier-Based PWM","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2089807","startPage":"1682","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5610731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"Natural Balancing of Flying Capacitor Voltages in Multicell Inverter Under PD Carrier-Based PWM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610731/","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12175163","publicationDate":"June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5610731/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"6","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Natural Balancing of Flying Capacitor Voltages in Multicell Inverter Under PD Carrier-Based PWM","sourcePdf":"tpel-shukla-2089807-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062531S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5959286","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5959286","articleId":"5610731","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5610740,"authors":[{"name":"Karl Rupp","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Technische Universit\u00e4t Wien, Wien, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/66/5709549/5610740/5610740-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Karl Rupp (S'10) was born in Austria in 1984.

Performance evaluation through realistic WiMAX simulations shows that our proposed scheme can significantly reduce 65% of the feedback load while achieving 98% multicast throughput performance compared with the case of full feedback.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Feedback Load of Opportunistic Multicast Scheduling over Wireless Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2010.12.101406","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/5654470/05610963.pdf","startPage":"1179","endPage":"1181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2010.12.101406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5610963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610963/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2010","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Feedback Load of Opportunistic Multicast Scheduling over Wireless Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5610963/","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","publicationDate":"December 2010","accessionNumber":"11674882","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Feedback Load of Opportunistic Multicast Scheduling over Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"1179-cl1012-huang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049165S","chronDate":"December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"5654470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5654470","articleId":"5610963","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5610964,"authors":[{"name":"Illsoo Sohn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Illsoo","lastName":"Sohn","id":"37543146800"},{"name":"Jeffrey G.

We consider stochastic interference demands of SUs and the existence of random disturbances in PUs' interference observations. Exploiting the fact that the dB value of the uplink inter-cell interference in CDMA networks is modeled as a Gaussian normal distribution, the price-demand decision process in each PU is given by a pair of stochastic differential equations. Then, we investigate an equilibrium of the interference market and its convergence in the context of asymptotic stability in the mean. Numerical results illustrate the convergence of the price-demand decision process to the equilibrium.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2010.12.101540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654470","startPage":"1122","endPage":"1124","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/5654470/05610966.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Investigation of Stochastic Market Equilibrium in Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5610966/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Investigation of Stochastic Market Equilibrium in Cognitive Radio Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2010","accessionNumber":"11674898","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"14","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Investigation of Stochastic Market Equilibrium in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"1122-cl1012-byun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056676S","chronDate":"December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"5654470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5654470","articleId":"5610966","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5610967,"authors":[{"name":"Seok-Hwan Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seok-Hwan","lastName":"Park","id":"37293216300"},{"name":"Haewook Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Haewook","lastName":"Park","id":"37535513100"},{"name":"Inkyu Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Inkyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279664500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5610967","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1099},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitters","Receivers","Integrated circuits","Interference channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","distributed algorithms","iterative methods","optimisation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed beamforming techniques","weighted sum-rate maximization","MISO interference channels","WSR maximization","multiple-input single-output interference channels","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio approximation","SINR approximation","zero-gradient-based algorithm","ZG-based algorithm","iteration method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed beamforming","weighted sum-rate maximization","interference channel"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a beamforming technique for weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization in multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channels.

When there are more than two users, further approximation is employed to fully decouple the problem. Then, the decoupled problems are solved by using a zero-gradient (ZG) based algorithm which converges to a local optimal point with only a few iterations.

The traditional message-passing scheduling, called flooding, consists of updating all the variable nodes in the graph, using the same pre-update information, followed by updating all the check nodes of the graph, again, using the same pre-update information. Recently, several studies show that sequential scheduling, in which messages are generated using the latest available information, significantly improves the convergence speed in terms of number of iterations. Sequential scheduling introduces the problem of finding the best sequence of message updates. We propose Informed Dynamic Scheduling (IDS) strategies that select the message-passing schedule according to the observed rate of change of the messages. In general, IDS strategies require computation to select the message to update but converge in fewer message updates because they focus on the part of the graph that has not converged. Moreover, IDS yields a lower error-rate performance than either flooding or sequential scheduling because IDS strategies overcome traditional trapping-set errors. This paper presents IDS strategies that address several issues including performance for short-blocklength codes, complexity, and implementability.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.101910.070303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.101910.070303","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5666469/05610969.pdf","startPage":"3470","endPage":"3479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC Decoders with Informed Dynamic Scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"LDPC Decoders with Informed Dynamic Scheduling","volume":"58","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5610969/","publicationDate":"December 2010","accessionNumber":"11693269","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610969/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC Decoders with Informed Dynamic Scheduling","sourcePdf":"3470-tc1012-casado.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108962S","chronDate":"December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5666469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5666469","articleId":"5610969","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5610973,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Angerer","affiliation":["Institute for Communications and Radio Frequency, University of Technology, Vienna, Wien, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5666469/5610973/5610973-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christoph Angerer received his Dipl.-Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the Vienna University of Technology in 2005, with distinction.

Currently, only answers of a single tag can be decoded in such a system. If multiple tags respond simultaneously, a collision occurs.

This work shows how to recover from such collisions on the physical layer and successfully read the data. The contributions of the paper are: 1) An analysis of the achievable throughput increase of a system, that can recover from collisions at a physical layer is given. 2) A model for a description of collisions on the physical layer is presented. 3) Based on this model, we propose a channel estimation method and two types of receiver structures for separating the signals of a collision of two tags: first, single antenna receivers that discriminate the sources of the two tags in the I/Q plane, and second, multiple antenna receivers which exploit the different spatial signatures of both tags. 4) The functionality of the proposed receiver structures is verified with measurement data of two colliding tags. Eventually, a performance analysis of the receivers is provided.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.101910.100004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5666469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.101910.100004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5666469/05610973.pdf","startPage":"3526","endPage":"3537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RFID Reader Receivers for Physical Layer Collision Recovery","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"RFID Reader Receivers for Physical Layer Collision Recovery","volume":"58","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 December 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5610973/","publicationDate":"December 2010","accessionNumber":"11693287","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610973/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RFID Reader Receivers for Physical Layer Collision Recovery","sourcePdf":"3526-tc1012-angerer.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119111S","chronDate":"December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5666469","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"5666469","articleId":"5610973","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5610974,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5686852/5610974/5610974-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Shi received the B.

Master nodes collect data from sensor nodes and answer the queries from the network owner. The reliance on master nodes for data storage and query processing raises serious concerns about both data confidentiality and query-result correctness in hostile environments. In particular, a compromised master node may leak hosted sensitive data to the adversary; it may also return juggled or incomplete data in response to a query. This paper presents a novel spatiotemporal approach to ensure secure range queries in event-driven two-tier sensor networks. It offers data confidentiality by preventing master nodes from reading hosted data and also enables efficient range-query processing. More importantly, it allows the network owner to verify with very high probability whether a query result is authentic and complete by examining the spatial and temporal relationships among the returned data. The high efficacy and efficiency of our approach are confirmed by detailed performance evaluations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5686852/05610974.pdf","startPage":"264","endPage":"273","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.102210.100548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.102210.100548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5686852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5610974","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Spatiotemporal Approach for Secure Range Queries in Tiered Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Wireless sensor networks","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Encryption","Query processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatiotemporal approach","secure range queries","tiered sensor network","resource-rich master node","resource-poor sensor node","data storage","data confidentiality","query-result correctness","hostile environment","event-driven two-tier sensor network","range-query processing","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","range query","security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610974/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Spatiotemporal Approach for Secure Range Queries in Tiered Sensor Networks","volume":"10","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5610974/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742915","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Spatiotemporal Approach for Secure Range Queries in Tiered Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"264-tw1101-shi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07089S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5686852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5686852","articleId":"5610974","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5610977,"authors":[{"name":"Kyoung-Jae Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5663931/5610977/5610977-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyoung-Jae Lee (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and 2007, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the School of Electrical Engineering.

We propose a unified algorithm which computes the optimal linear transceivers jointly at the source node and the relay nodes for amplify-and-forward (AF) protocols. First, optimization designs based on the sum-rate and the mean-square error (MSE) criteria are formulated for the two-way AF relaying channel. Due to non-convexity of the given problems, the proposed schemes iteratively identify local-optimal source and relay filters by deriving the gradients of the cost functions for a gradient descent algorithm. Then, the proposed algorithm can optimize a one-way multiple relay system as a special case of the two-way channel. Finally, we prove the global optimality of the maximum sum-rate scheme under an asymptotically large antenna assumption. From simulation results, it is confirmed that the proposed methods yield the near optimum result for the MIMO multiple relay channel even with a moderate number of antennas. Consequently, we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional schemes in terms of the sum-rate and the error performance for both one-way and two-way protocols.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.102210.091021","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5663931/05610977.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.102210.091021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663931","startPage":"3671","endPage":"3681","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Optimization for One and Two-Way MIMO AF Multiple-Relay Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5610977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint Optimization for One and Two-Way MIMO AF Multiple-Relay Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610977/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2010","accessionNumber":"11692581","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5610977/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Optimization for One and Two-Way MIMO AF Multiple-Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"3671-tw1012-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129805S","chronDate":"December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5663931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"175","xplore-issue":"5663931","articleId":"5610977","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5610978,"authors":[{"name":"Hui-Ming Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Hui-Ming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405983100"},{"name":"Xiang-Gen Xia","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Communication, Chonbuk National University of Korea, Jeonju, South Korea","School of Electronic and Information, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Xiang-Gen","lastName":"Xia","id":"37274950700"},{"name":"Qinye Yin","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Qinye","lastName":"Yin","id":"37270668400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5610978","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1244},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Receivers","Delay","Decoding","Decision feedback equalizers","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","least mean squares methods","linear codes","network coding","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear analog network coding","distributed two-way relay network","multiple spatial-separated relay nodes","time asynchronous two-way relay network","relay node","mixed asynchronous signals","Toeplitz matrix","linear receivers","minimum mean square error receivers","delay profiles","timing errors","decoding","MMSE","zero-forcing receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog network coding","asynchronous relay networks","full diversity","linear receiver","space-time codes"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Linear Analog Network Coding for Asynchronous Two-Way Relay Networks","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.102210.101071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663931","endPage":"3637","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5663931/05610978.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.102210.101071","startPage":"3630","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5610978","abstract":"Time asynchronism is a practical issue need to be addressed for a general distributed two-way relay network, where two terminal nodes exchange information through multiple spatial-separated relay nodes.

In the proposed scheme, each relay node linearly transforms the received mixed asynchronous signals in the first time-slot by a Toeplitz matrix, and then broadcasts them back to the terminals in the second time-slot. A sufficient condition is derived for the proposed ANC to achieve full cooperative diversity using only linear receivers at the terminal nodes, such as zero-forcing (ZF), or minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers, with any delay profiles of the timing errors. The decoding of the proposed ANC scheme is computationally efficient and the symbol rate can approach 1, when the coding block length is sufficiently large compared to the number of relay nodes R and the timing errors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2010","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11692586","htmlLink":"/document/5610978/","displayDocTitle":"A Linear Analog Network Coding for Asynchronous Two-Way Relay Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Linear Analog Network Coding for Asynchronous Two-Way Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"3630-tw1012-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082745S","chronDate":"December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5663931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5663931","articleId":"5610978","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5610980,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Sacrist\u00e1n-Murga","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5663931/5610980/5610980-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Sacrist\u00e1n-Murga (S'09) received the B.S. degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the Technical University of Madrid (UPM), in July 2005, and his M.S. degree in Information Technology from the Mannheim University of Applied Sciences in July 2007.

This algorithm is applied to the channel Gram matrix using geodesic curves and exploiting the intrinsic geometry of positive definite Hermitian matrices.

Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm improves other techniques based on the direct quantization of the channel response matrix or the quantization of the subspace spanned by the strongest eigenmodes of the MIMO channel, i.e., Grassmannian based techniques. The main drawback of Grassmannian based algorithms is that the transmitter is constrained to apply a uniform power allocation among spatial transmission modes, which is not forced in the algorithm proposed in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Feedback of MIMO Channel Gram Matrices Based on Geodesic Curves","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.102210.091686","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5663931/05610980.pdf","startPage":"3714","endPage":"3727","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.102210.091686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5663931","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5610980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5610980/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2010","displayDocTitle":"Differential Feedback of MIMO Channel Gram Matrices Based on Geodesic Curves","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5610980/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","publicationDate":"December 2010","accessionNumber":"11692588","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Feedback of MIMO Channel Gram Matrices Based on Geodesic Curves","sourcePdf":"3714-tw1012-murga.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097912S","chronDate":"December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5663931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5663931","articleId":"5610980","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5610982,"authors":[{"name":"Mike Shuo-Wei Chen","affiliation":["Atheros Communications, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5625049/5610982/5610982-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mike Shuo-Wei Chen (M'06) received the B.S. degree from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 1998 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degree from University of California, Berkeley, in 2002 and 2006, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","From 2001 to 2006, he was a Graduate Research Assistant at Berkeley Wireless Research Center, working on low-power and high-speed mixed signal circuits, ultrawideband system design, digital baseband and digital ASIC implementation.

The resulted model can be used to analyze the behavior of a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) active noise control (ANC) system in real application where coupling of sources can not be neglected. Comparison of results to the case that coupling will be ignored among loudspeakers shows that coupling will effectively change the strength of sources and hence the required voltage signals to drive the loudspeakers.

The algorithm combines the benefits of sampling-based motion planning with MPC while avoiding some of the major pitfalls facing both traditional sampling-based planning algorithms and traditional MPC. The method is based on sampling (i.e., discretizing) the input space at each sample period and implementing a goal-directed optimization method (e.g., A*) in place of standard numerical optimization. This formulation of MPC readily applies to systems with nonlinear dynamics and avoids the local minima which can limit the performance of MPC algorithms implemented using traditional, derivative-based, nonlinear programming. The SBMPC algorithm is compared with a more standard online MPC algorithm using cluttered environment navigation for an Ackerman steered vehicle and a set point problem for a nonlinear, continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5611171/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11624589","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Model Predictive Control using sampling and goal-directed optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Model Predictive Control using sampling and goal-directed optimization","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"0515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091984S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5604775","isNumber":"5611035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5604775","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5611035","articleId":"5611171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5611184,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongjing Ma","affiliation":["Center for Sustainable Systems CSS and the School of Natural Resources and Environment, University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Zhongjing","lastName":"Ma","id":"37289450400"},{"name":"Duncan Callaway","affiliation":["Energy and Resources Group, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Duncan","lastName":"Callaway","id":"37392747300"},{"name":"Ian Hiskens","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, USA"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Hiskens","id":"37269731100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5362-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5363-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"5611184","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":105,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1604},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nash equilibrium","Electricity","Games","Distributed control","Convergence","Batteries","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralised control","electric vehicles","game theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized charging control","large populations","plug-in electric vehicles","Nash certainty equivalence principle","mean-field games","social optimality","PEV charging schedule","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decentralized control","plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)","Nash certainty equivalence (NCE) principle","\u2018valley-fill\u2019 charging control"]}],"abstract":"The paper develops and illustrates a novel decentralized charging control algorithm for large populations of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs).

A multi-input multi-output model is developed using multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network which is trained by Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and amplitude modulated pseudo random binary (APRBS) signals with noise as data sets. Model predictive control also uses Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for the control signal optimization. The control performance is improved by using a disturbance model that compensates both model mismatch and external disturbance. The learning rate of disturbance estimation network changes adaptively to treat the model mismatch differently from the external disturbance. Simulation results using the quadruple-tank are employed to show the effectiveness of the method.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2010.5611265","pdfPath":"/iel5/5604775/5611035/05611265.pdf","startPage":"920","endPage":"925","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2010.5611265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network model-based predictive control for multivariable nonlinear systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Neural network model-based predictive control for multivariable nonlinear systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11624683","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5611265/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network model-based predictive control for multivariable nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"0035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095784S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5604775","isNumber":"5611035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5604775","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5611035","articleId":"5611265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":5611267,"authors":[{"name":"Kiyotaka Shimizu","affiliation":["Faculty of System Design Engineering, Keio University, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyotaka","lastName":"Shimizu","id":"37334685800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5362-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5363-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"5611267","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611267","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Equations","Stability analysis","Mathematical model","Servomotors","Manuals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","gradient methods","nonlinear systems","pendulums","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D control","passive nonlinear systems","inverted pendulum","affine nonlinear systems","Lagrangian systems","proportional action","strict positive real action","derivative action","asymptotically stability","passivity theory","LaSalle invariance principle","direct gradient descent control"]}],"abstract":"This paper is concerned with P\u00b7SPR\u00b7D control of affine nonlinear systems and Lagrangian systems which are passive system.

In accelerators, such as heavy-ion synchrotrons, RF feedback systems are used to damp longitudinal oscillation modes of the particle beam. Longitudinal modes have been analyzed in detail by accelerator physicists and there exists a closed theory that describes most of the observed phenomena in synchrotrons. However, from the point of view of the control engineer who wants to design the RF controls, there is a lack of convenient models to study the RF control loop dynamics analytically. Recently, it was shown that the interaction of the RF and the first two longitudinal modes can be described by a bilinear model. In this paper, it is shown that the measurement of the first harmonic of the beam current signal is sufficient to calculate the model output vector. This result is used to design nonlinear controls for the second longitudinal oscillation mode. The control design is based on the sumof- squares decomposition. The controls are compared using particle tracking simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611270/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5611270/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11624688","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Damping of longitudinal modes in heavy-ion synchrotrons by RF-feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping of longitudinal modes in heavy-ion synchrotrons by RF-feedback","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"0061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05413S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5604775","isNumber":"5611035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5604775","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5611035","articleId":"5611270","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5611295,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Ting Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Ting","lastName":"Kuo","id":"38239665200"},{"name":"I-Iming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"I-Iming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37596218000"},{"name":"Feng-Li Lian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Feng-Li","lastName":"Lian","id":"37300823500"},{"name":"Yi-Chun Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yi-Chun Lin","id":"37087286630"},{"name":"Jong-Hann Jean","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Saint John''s University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jong-Hann","lastName":"Jean","id":"37383320300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5362-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5363-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"5611295","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"abstract":"The paper proposes a receiver-based, rate and quality control mechanism. The main principle is to regulate encoding rate to guarantee the video quality is acceptable, especially in region of interest. Transmitting the encoded bit stream in multicast delivery not only improves bandwidth efficiency but also provides different quality for receivers with different length of bit stream. The overall mechanism can be separated into temporal sampling and spatial coding. Temporal sampling chooses the clearest frame to reduce the cost of encoding and transmitting blur or similar frame. On the spatial coding, embedded coding is performed to discard partial wavelet coefficients to provide multi-resolution of the frame. Experimental results show that the correctness of moving object detection in mobile cameras. Besides, the quality of received video and the bandwidth efficiency under different bandwidth limitation are also analyzed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Encoding","Image coding","Image edge detection","Streaming media","Pixel","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","mobile radio","multicast communication","sampling methods","video cameras","video coding","video communication","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["temporal sampling","spatial coding","video transmission","mobile cameras","video encoding rate control","video quality control","encoded bit stream","multicast delivery","embedded coding","partial wavelet coefficients","moving object detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Surveillance systems","real-time video transmission","rate control","moving object detection","embedded coding","region of interest"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCA.2010.5611295","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5604775/5611035/05611295.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2010.5611295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temporal sampling and spatial coding for rate control of video transmission on mobile cameras","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Temporal sampling and spatial coding for rate control of video transmission on mobile cameras","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611295/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5611295/","accessionNumber":"11624713","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal sampling and spatial coding for rate control of video transmission on mobile cameras","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"0196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06054S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5604775","isNumber":"5611035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5604775","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5611035","articleId":"5611295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5611320,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Chung Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Chung","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537582100"},{"name":"Chi-Ying Lin","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Ying Lin","id":"37087590836"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5362-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5363-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1085-1992"}],"articleNumber":"5611320","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Predictive control","Tracking","Motion control","Computational modeling","Book reviews"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constraint handling","control system synthesis","discrete time systems","predictive control","quadratic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model predictive control","periodic signal tracking","constraint handling","fast sampled-data control systems","control design","fast sampled-data systems","internal model","discrete time repetitive control law","quadratic programming problem","computational control","piezo-actuated system","asymptotic error tracking","frequency 10 kHz"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611320","doi":"10.1109/CCA.2010.5611320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.2010.5611320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611035","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5604775/5611035/05611320.pdf","startPage":"626","endPage":"631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model predictive control with repetitive control for periodic signal tracking and constraint handling of fast sampled-data control systems","abstract":"This paper presents design and implementation of model predictive control with repetitive control for periodic signal tracking and constraint handling of fast sampled-data systems.

It is an essential subject in Computer Programming and Digital Electronics. While teaching the Boolean logic, teacher usually gives examples to elaborate the Boolean logic formulation. However, the physical meaning of the Boolean logic is difficult for students to imagine without the realization to real-world case. The classical Pac-Man game which has clear Boolean logic game rules and simple game scenario is chosen as the teaching aid. Accordingly, two learning activities, the Boolean logic realization activity and game scenario formulation activity, are proposed. Our idea is that through game rule tuning in the learning activities, the students can comprehend how the changing of game rule (Boolean logic) affects the game scenario. To manipulate the game scenario for teaching specific learning objectives of Boolean logic, the Game Rule of the original Pac-Man game is defined and seven versions of modified game scenarios provided as illustrations are appropriately organized for students to practice one Boolean logic concept each time. The experimental results showed the proposed activity can have higher learning achievements compared to the traditional lecturing.","doi":"10.1109/TLT.2010.33","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/4620076/5669970/05611479.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TLT.2010.33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Teaching Boolean Logic through Game Rule Tuning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Teaching Boolean Logic through Game Rule Tuning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611479/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11698294","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5611479/","volume":"3","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Teaching Boolean Logic through Game Rule Tuning","sourcePdf":"tlt2010040319.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090104S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4620076","isNumber":"5669970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4620076","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5669970","articleId":"5611479","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5611491,"authors":[{"name":"Ziliang Zong","affiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Department, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Rapid, SD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5702392/5611491/5611491-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ziliang Zong received the BS and MS degrees in computer science from Shandong University of China in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the PhD degree in computer science from Auburn University in 2008.

On one hand, high performance is certainly an important consideration in designing clusters to run parallel applications. On the other hand, the ever increasing energy cost requires us to effectively conserve energy in clusters. To achieve the goal of optimizing both performance and energy efficiency in clusters, in this paper, we propose two energy-efficient duplication-based scheduling algorithms-Energy-Aware Duplication (EAD) scheduling and Performance-Energy Balanced Duplication (PEBD) scheduling. Existing duplication-based scheduling algorithms replicate all possible tasks to shorten schedule length without reducing energy consumption caused by duplication. Our algorithms, in contrast, strive to balance schedule lengths and energy savings by judiciously replicating predecessors of a task if the duplication can aid in performance without degrading energy efficiency. To illustrate the effectiveness of EAD and PEBD, we compare them with a nonduplication algorithm, a traditional duplication-based algorithm, and the dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) algorithm. Extensive experimental results using both synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications demonstrate that our algorithms can effectively save energy with marginal performance degradation.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"360","endPage":"374","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.216","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5702392/05611491.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5702392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EAD and PEBD: Two Energy-Aware Duplication Scheduling Algorithms for Parallel Tasks on Homogeneous Clusters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611491/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"EAD and PEBD: Two Energy-Aware Duplication Scheduling Algorithms for Parallel Tasks on Homogeneous Clusters","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11775713","volume":"60","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5611491/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EAD and PEBD: Two Energy-Aware Duplication Scheduling Algorithms for Parallel Tasks on Homogeneous Clusters","sourcePdf":"ttc2011030360.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094534S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5702392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5702392","articleId":"5611491","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5611493,"authors":[{"name":"Ashkan H.

Optimal normal basis type II is a special class of normal basis exhibiting very low multiplication complexity and is considered as a safe choice for hardware implementation of cryptographic applications. In this paper, high-speed architectures for binary field multiplication using reordered normal basis are proposed, where reordered normal basis is referred to as a certain permutation of optimal normal basis type II. Complexity comparison shows that the proposed architectures are faster compared to previously presented architectures in the open literature using either an optimal normal basis type II or a reordered normal basis. One advantage of the new word-level architectures is that the critical path delay is a constant (not a function of word size). This enables the multipliers to operate at very high clock rates regardless of the field size or the number of words. Hardware implementation of some practical size multipliers for elliptic curve cryptography is also included.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6117145/05611493.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117145","startPage":"164","endPage":"172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed Architectures for Multiplication Using Reordered Normal Basis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611493","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed Architectures for Multiplication Using Reordered Normal Basis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611493/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12426971","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5611493/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed Architectures for Multiplication Using Reordered Normal Basis","sourcePdf":"ttc2012020164.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122249S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6117145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6117145","articleId":"5611493","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5611494,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6117145/5611494/5611494-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Miao Zhao received the BEng and MS degrees in electrical engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.

To pursue maximum energy saving at sensor nodes, intuitively, a mobile collector should traverse the transmission range of each sensor in the field such that each data packet can be directly transmitted to the mobile collector without any relay. However, this approach may lead to significantly increased data gathering latency due to the low moving velocity of the mobile collector. Fortunately, it is observed that data gathering latency can be effectively shortened by performing proper local aggregation via multihop transmissions and then uploading the aggregated data to the mobile collector. In such a scheme, the number of local transmission hops should not be arbitrarily large as it may increase the energy consumption on packet relays, which would adversely affect the overall efficiency of mobile data gathering. Based on these observations, in this paper, we study the tradeoff between energy saving and data gathering latency in mobile data gathering by exploring a balance between the relay hop count of local data aggregation and the moving tour length of the mobile collector. We first propose a polling-based mobile gathering approach and formulate it into an optimization problem, named bounded relay hop mobile data gathering (BRH-MDG). Specifically, a subset of sensors will be selected as polling points that buffer locally aggregated data and upload the data to the mobile collector when it arrives. In the meanwhile, when sensors are affiliated with these polling points, it is guaranteed that any packet relay is bounded within a given number of hops. We then give two efficient algorithms for selecting polling points among sensors. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2010.219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6117145/05611494.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2010.219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117145","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounded Relay Hop Mobile Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611494/","displayDocTitle":"Bounded Relay Hop Mobile Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"61","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12426972","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5611494/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounded Relay Hop Mobile Data Gathering in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttc2012020265.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095916S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6117145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"6117145","articleId":"5611494","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-28"},{"_id":5611496,"authors":[{"name":"Jaliya Ekanayake","affiliation":["School of Informatics and Computing and Pervasive Technology Institute, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5756300/5611496/5611496-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jaliya Ekanayake is a PhD candidate at the School of Informatics and Computing of Indiana University, Bloomington.

It moves the application software and databases to the centralized large data centers, where the management of the data and services may not be fully trustworthy. This unique paradigm brings about many new security challenges, which have not been well understood. This work studies the problem of ensuring the integrity of data storage in Cloud Computing. In particular, we consider the task of allowing a third party auditor (TPA), on behalf of the cloud client, to verify the integrity of the dynamic data stored in the cloud. The introduction of TPA eliminates the involvement of the client through the auditing of whether his data stored in the cloud are indeed intact, which can be important in achieving economies of scale for Cloud Computing. The support for data dynamics via the most general forms of data operation, such as block modification, insertion, and deletion, is also a significant step toward practicality, since services in Cloud Computing are not limited to archive or backup data only. While prior works on ensuring remote data integrity often lacks the support of either public auditability or dynamic data operations, this paper achieves both. We first identify the difficulties and potential security problems of direct extensions with fully dynamic data updates from prior works and then show how to construct an elegant verification scheme for the seamless integration of these two salient features in our protocol design. In particular, to achieve efficient data dynamics, we improve the existing proof of storage models by manipulating the classic Merkle Hash Tree construction for block tag authentication. To support efficient handling of multiple auditing tasks, we further explore the technique of bilinear aggregate signature to extend our main result into a multiuser setting, where TPA can perform multiple auditing tasks simultaneously. Extensive security and performance analysis show that the proposed schemes are highly efficient and provably secure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611497/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","volume":"22","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"11903405","dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enabling Public Auditability and Data Dynamics for Storage Security in Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling Public Auditability and Data Dynamics for Storage Security in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"ttd2011050847.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050666S","chronDate":"May  2011","isNumber":"5739684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"617","articleId":"5611497","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":5611500,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Moreno-Vozmediano","affiliation":["Department of Computer Architecture, Complutense University of Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/5756300/5611500/5611500-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rafael Moreno-Vozmediano received the MS degree in physics and the PhD degree from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Spain, in 1991 and 1995, respectively.

Unlike traditional utilities where a single provider scheme is a common practice, the ubiquitous access to cloud resources easily enables the simultaneous use of different clouds. In this paper, we explore this scenario to deploy a computing cluster on the top of a multicloud infrastructure, for solving loosely coupled Many-Task Computing (MTC) applications. In this way, the cluster nodes can be provisioned with resources from different clouds to improve the cost effectiveness of the deployment, or to implement high-availability strategies. We prove the viability of this kind of solutions by evaluating the scalability, performance, and cost of different configurations of a Sun Grid Engine cluster, deployed on a multicloud infrastructure spanning a local data center and three different cloud sites: Amazon EC2 Europe, Amazon EC2 US, and ElasticHosts. Although the testbed deployed in this work is limited to a reduced number of computing resources (due to hardware and budget limitations), we have complemented our analysis with a simulated infrastructure model, which includes a larger number of resources, and runs larger problem sizes. Data obtained by simulation show that performance and cost results can be extrapolated to large-scale problems and cluster infrastructures.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2010.186","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5756300/05611500.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2010.186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5756300","startPage":"924","endPage":"930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicloud Deployment of Computing Clusters for Loosely Coupled MTC Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multicloud Deployment of Computing Clusters for Loosely Coupled MTC Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611500/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"11971990","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5611500/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicloud Deployment of Computing Clusters for Loosely Coupled MTC Applications","sourcePdf":"ttd2011060924.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071239S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5756300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5756300","articleId":"5611500","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5611505,"authors":[{"name":"Tiffany M.

Our architecture exposes coarse-grain parallelism by dividing the search space among parallel processing elements (PEs) and each PE exposes fine-grain memory parallelism for their lower-bound computation, the kernel computation performed by each PE. Inter-PE communication is performed entirely on-chip. When using this coprocessor for maximum-parsimony reconstruction for gene-order data, our coprocessor achieves a 40X improvement over software in search throughput, corresponding to a 14X end-to-end application improvement when including all communication and systems overheads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cluster-on-a-Chip Architecture for High-Throughput Phylogeny Search","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2010.191","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/6163459/05611505.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2010.191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6163459","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611505/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Cluster-on-a-Chip Architecture for High-Throughput Phylogeny Search","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5611505/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12571560","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cluster-on-a-Chip Architecture for High-Throughput Phylogeny Search","sourcePdf":"ttd2012040579.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089577S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6163459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6163459","articleId":"5611505","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5611507,"authors":[{"name":"Dongning Luo","affiliation":["University of North Carolina, Charlotte, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2945/6078463/5611507/5611507-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongning Luo received the BE degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Thus, event-related tasks, such as detecting real life events that drive the generation of the text documents, tracking event evolutions, and investigating reports and commentaries about events of interest, are important when exploring such text collections. To incorporate and leverage human efforts in conducting such tasks, we propose a novel visual analytics approach named EventRiver. EventRiver integrates event-based automated text analysis and visualization to reveal the events motivating the text generation and the long term stories they construct. On the visualization, users can interactively conduct tasks such as event browsing, tracking, association, and investigation. A working prototype of EventRiver has been implemented for exploring news corpora. A set of case studies, experiments, and a preliminary user test have been conducted to evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/6078463/05611507.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6078463","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EventRiver: Visually Exploring Text Collections with Temporal References","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantics","Visualization","Clustering algorithms","Bismuth","Context","Humans","Text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EventRiver","visually exploring text collections","temporal references","news corpora","Weblogs","event-related tasks","visual analytics approach","event-based automated text analysis","text visualization","text generation","event browsing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visual analytics","information visualization","topic","event","text","clustering."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Cluster Analysis","Computer Graphics","Database Management Systems","Databases, Factual","Humans","Mass Media","Models, Theoretical","Semantics","Time Factors","User-Computer Interface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"EventRiver: Visually Exploring Text Collections with Temporal References","volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5611507/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12357256","pubMedId":"22076487","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EventRiver: Visually Exploring Text Collections with Temporal References","sourcePdf":"ttg2012010093.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090662S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"6078463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6078463","articleId":"5611507","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5611524,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Shi","affiliation":["University of Maryland, Baltimore, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6047986/5611524/5611524-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Shi received the BE degree in computer science and technology from Zhejiang University, China, in 2006, and is currently pursuing the PhD degree at the Department of Information Systems at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC).

Anomalous windows are the contiguous groupings of data points. A linear path refers to a path represented by a line with a single dimensional spatial coordinate marking an observation point. In this paper, we propose an approach for discovering anomalous windows using a class of algorithms based on scan statistics, specifically 1) an Order invariant algorithm using Scan Statistics for Linear Intersecting Paths (SSLIP), 2) Brute force-SSLIP (BF-SSLIP), and 3) Central Brute Force-SSLIP (CBF-SSLIP). We further present two efficient variants of SSLIP: SSLIP* which employs a upper bound on the scan window size, and SSLIP-Acc, which adopts an accelerator function to speed up the scan process. The proposed approach for discovering anomalous windows along linear paths comprises the following distinct steps: 1) Cross Path Discovery: where we identify a subset of intersecting paths to be considered, 2) Anomalous Window Discovery: where we outline the various algorithms for the traversal of the cross paths to identify varying size directional windows along the paths. For identifying an anomalous window, an unusualness metric is computed, in the form of a likelihood ratio to indicate the degree of unusualness of this window with respect to the rest of the data. We identify the window with the highest likelihood ratio as our anomalous window, and 3) Monte Carlo Simulations: to ascertain whether this window is truly anomalous and not merely random occurrence, we perform hypothesis testing by computing a p-value using Monte Carlo Simulations. We present extensive experimental results in real world accident data sets for various highways with known issues (code and data available from [32], [27]). Additionally, we also perform comparisons with current approaches [18], [34] to show the efficacy of our approach. Our results show that our approach indeed is effective in identifying anomalous traffic accident windows along multiple intersecting highways.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous Window Discovery for Linear Intersecting Paths","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2010.212","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/6047986/05611524.pdf","startPage":"1857","endPage":"1871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6047986","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611524/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous Window Discovery for Linear Intersecting Paths","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5611524/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12302955","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous Window Discovery for Linear Intersecting Paths","sourcePdf":"ttk2011121857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103609S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6047986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6047986","articleId":"5611524","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5611528,"authors":[{"name":"Jens Teubner","affiliation":["Systems Group, Department of Computer Science, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5898452/5611528/5611528-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jens Teubner received the PhD degree from the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen in Munich, Germany, in 2006, for his work on the Pathfinder XQuery compiler.

In this paper, we explore how to accelerate the computation of frequent items using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with a threefold goal: increase performance over existing solutions, reduce energy consumption over CPU-based systems, and explore the design space in detail as the constraints on FPGAs are very different from those of traditional software-based systems. We discuss three design alternatives, each one of them exploiting different FPGA features and each one providing different performance/scalability trade-offs. An important result of the paper is to demonstrate how the inherent massive parallelism of FPGAs can improve performance of existing algorithms but only after a fundamental redesign of the algorithms. Our experimental results show that, e.g., the pipelined solution we introduce can reach more than 100 million tuples per second of sustained throughput (four times the best available results to date) by making use of techniques that are not available to CPU-based solutions. Moreover, and unlike in software approaches, the high throughput is independent of the skew of the Zipf distribution of the input and at a far lower energy cost.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2010.216","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/5898452/05611528.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2010.216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898452","startPage":"1169","endPage":"1181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequent Item Computation on a Chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611528","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequent Item Computation on a Chip","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611528/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12063419","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5611528/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequent Item Computation on a Chip","sourcePdf":"ttk2011081169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074785S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"5898452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5898452","articleId":"5611528","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":5611532,"authors":[{"name":"Jaeseok Yun","affiliation":["U embedded Convergence Research Center, Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, Seongnam, South Korea","School of Interactive Computing & GVU Center, College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5733931/5611532/5611532-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jaeseok Yun received the MS and PhD degrees in mechatronics from the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea, in 1999 and 2006, respectively.

Our results show that with reasonable assumptions on size, mass, placement, and efficiency of VDRG harvesters, most body-mounted wireless sensors and even some consumer electronics devices can be powered continuously and indefinitely from everyday motion. We have optimized the power harvesters for each individual and for each body location. In addition, we present the potential of designing a damping- and frequency-tunable power harvester that could mitigate the power reduction of a generator generalized for \"average\u201d subjects. We present the full details on the collection of the acceleration data sets, the development of the VDRG model, and a numerical simulator, and discuss some of the future challenges that remain in this promising field of research.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2010.202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5733931/05611532.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2010.202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5733931","startPage":"669","endPage":"683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Performance of an Optimal Inertial Power Harvester for Human-Powered Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Performance of an Optimal Inertial Power Harvester for Human-Powered Devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611532/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11874732","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5611532/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Performance of an Optimal Inertial Power Harvester for Human-Powered Devices","sourcePdf":"ttm2011050669.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109842S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5733931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5733931","articleId":"5611532","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5611534,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Shi","affiliation":["Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5962742/5611534/5611534-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Shi received the PhD degree in computer engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in 2007.

An important problem for such networks is its capacity. We study this problem for CRNs in the SINR (signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio) model, which is considered to be a better characterization of interference (but also more difficult to analyze) than disk graph model. The main difficulties of this problem are two-fold. First, SINR is a nonconvex function of transmission powers; an optimization problem in the SINR model is usually a nonconvex program and NP-hard in general. Second, in the SINR model, scheduling feasibility and the maximum allowed flow rate on each link are determined by SINR at the physical layer. To maximize capacity, it is essential to follow a cross-layer approach, but joint optimization at physical (power control), link (scheduling), and network (flow routing) layers with the SINR function is inherently difficult. In this paper, we give a mathematical characterization of the joint relationship among these layers. We devise a solution procedure that provides a (1- \\varepsilon ) optimal solution to this complex problem, where \\varepsilon is the required accuracy. Our theoretical result offers a performance benchmark for any other algorithms developed for practical implementation. Using numerical results, we demonstrate the efficacy of the solution procedure and offer quantitative understanding on the interaction of power control, scheduling, and flow routing in a CRN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611534/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","volume":"10","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"12175446","publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5611534/","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing Capacity in Multihop Cognitive Radio Networks under the SINR Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing Capacity in Multihop Cognitive Radio Networks under the SINR Model","sourcePdf":"ttm2011070954.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113164S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5962742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"5962742","articleId":"5611534","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5611537,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5962742/5611537/5611537-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Wang received the BS degree in communication engineering and the PhD degree in signal and information processing in 2004 and 2009, respectively, both from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), P.R.

A TDM-based power-control strategy is adopted to achieve maximum end-to-end throughput by choosing an appropriate multihop route and spectrum combination for each single flow. Then, the simpler solution is extended to the multiflow case in which interflow interference and cumulative interference temperature must be considered. Considering the overhead of switching route and spectrum, the optimal waiting time before making a switch is derived.

Thus, unlike Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) and other popular discriminative dimension reduction criteria, MMDA duly considers the separation of all class pairs. To deal with general case of data distribution, we also extend MMDA to kernel MMDA (KMMDA). Dimension reduction via MMDA/KMMDA leads to a nonsmooth max-min optimization problem with orthonormal constraints. We develop a sequential convex relaxation algorithm to solve it approximately. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed criterion and the corresponding algorithm, we conduct classification and data visualization experiments on both synthetic data and real data sets.

This paper provides derivations of closed-form expressions of the mean packet delay for the gated service and the limited service of dynamic bandwidth allocation in Ethernet passive optical networks (EPONs). Based on the M/G/1 queueing analysis framework of a multiuser cyclic polling system, we derive the mean packet delay expressions by modifying the expressions for the reservation time component of the total delay. Results from simulation experiments confirm that our analysis can accurately predict the mean packet delay. Finally, we extend the analysis to demonstrate how the limited service can protect packets transmitted by a light-load user from having excessive delays due to high traffic loads from other users in the same EPON. The analytical results indicate that, in selecting the maximum length of a scheduling cycle for the limited service, there is a tradeoff between the mean packet delay under uniform traffic and the guaranteed upper bound on the mean packet delay under nonuniform traffic.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5642515/05611559.pdf","startPage":"3454","endPage":"3462","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2089971","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2089971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5642515","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Mean Packet Delay for Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation Algorithms in EPONs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Ethernet","EPON","Optical network units","Queueing analysis","Protocols","Wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","local area networks","optical fibre networks","queueing theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithm","EPON","closed form expression","gated service","Ethernet passive optical networks","queueing analysis","multiuser cyclic polling system","mean packet delay expression","reservation time component","light load user","length selection","scheduling cycle","uniform traffic load"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cyclic polling system","dynamic bandwidth allocation","Ethernet passive optical network (EPON)","packet delay analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Mean Packet Delay for Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation Algorithms in EPONs","volume":"28","issue":"23","htmlLink":"/document/5611559/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2010","accessionNumber":"11670128","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Mean Packet Delay for Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation Algorithms in EPONs","sourcePdf":"jlt-bharati-2089971-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077936S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2010","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5642515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5642515","articleId":"5611559","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5611565,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel C.

One major challenge for TFETs so far has been to achieve high drive currents, which is a prerequisite for high-performance operation. In this paper, we explore the performance potential of a 1-D TFET with a broken-gap heterojunction source injector using dissipative quantum transport simulations based on the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, as well as the carbon nanotube band structure as the model 1-D material system. We provide detailed insights into broken-gap TFET (BG-TFET) operation and show that it can, indeed, produce less than 60 mV/dec subthreshold swing at room temperature, even in the presence of electron-phonon scattering. The 1-D geometry is recognized to be uniquely favorable due to its superior electrostatic control, reduced carrier thermalization rate, and beneficial quantum confinement effects that reduce the off-state leakage below the thermionic limit. Because of higher source injection compared to staggered-gap and homojunction geometries, BG-TFET delivers superior performance that is comparable to MOSFET's.

Spectral-identification-based algorithms are sensitive to spectral variability and noise in acquisition. In most cases, both the target spatial distributions and the spectral signatures are unknown, so each pixel is separately tested and appears as a target when it significantly differs from the background. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of hyperspectral data, leading to detectors that are robust to noise. These algorithms consist in integrating adaptive spatial/spectral filtering into the adaptive matched filter and adaptive coherence estimator. Considering the HSIs as tensor data, our approach introduces a data representation involving multidimensional processing. It combines the advantages of spatial and spectral information using an alternating least square algorithm. To estimate the signal subspace dimension in each spatial mode, we extend the Akaike information criterion, and we develop an iterative algorithm for spectral-mode rank estimation. We demonstrate the interest of integrating the quadtree decomposition to perform an adaptive 3-D filtering and thereby preserve the local image characteristics. This leads to a significant improvement in terms of denoised tensor SNR and, consequently, in terms of detection probability. The performance of our method is exemplified using simulated and real-world HYperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment images.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2076288","startPage":"1383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5738422/05611588.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2076288","endPage":"1395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of Target-Detection Algorithms Based on Adaptive Three-Dimensional Filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611588/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of Target-Detection Algorithms Based on Adaptive Three-Dimensional Filtering","volume":"49","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5611588/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11883197","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","publicationDate":"April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of Target-Detection Algorithms Based on Adaptive Three-Dimensional Filtering","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bourennane-2076288-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113254S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5738422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5738422","articleId":"5611588","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5611590,"authors":[{"name":"Beg\u00fcm Demir","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Kocaeli, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5719225/5611590/5611590-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Beg\u00fcm Demir (S'06) received the B.S. and M.Sc. degrees in electronic and telecommunication engineering from Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, Turkey, in 2005 and 2007, respectively, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering.","In 2005, she joined the Kocaeli University Laboratory of Image and Signal Processing as a Researcher.

This is done by generalizing to multiclass problem techniques defined for binary classifiers. The investigated techniques exploit different query functions, which are based on the evaluation of two criteria: uncertainty and diversity. The uncertainty criterion is associated to the confidence of the supervised algorithm in correctly classifying the considered sample, while the diversity criterion aims at selecting a set of unlabeled samples that are as more diverse (distant one another) as possible, thus reducing the redundancy among the selected samples. The combination of the two criteria results in the selection of the potentially most informative set of samples at each iteration of the AL process. Moreover, we propose a novel query function that is based on a kernel-clustering technique for assessing the diversity of samples and a new strategy for selecting the most informative representative sample from each cluster. The investigated and proposed techniques are theoretically and experimentally compared with state-of-the-art methods adopted for RS applications. This is accomplished by considering very high resolution multispectral and hyperspectral images. By this comparison, we observed that the proposed method resulted in better accuracy with respect to other investigated and state-of-the art methods on both the considered data sets. Furthermore, we derived some guidelines on the design of AL systems for the classification of different types of RS images.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2072929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5719225/05611590.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2072929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5719225","startPage":"1014","endPage":"1031","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Batch-Mode Active-Learning Methods for the Interactive Classification of Remote Sensing Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Batch-Mode Active-Learning Methods for the Interactive Classification of Remote Sensing Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611590/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11833868","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5611590/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Batch-Mode Active-Learning Methods for the Interactive Classification of Remote Sensing Images","sourcePdf":"tgrs-bruzzone-2072929-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106756S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5719225","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"200","xplore-issue":"5719225","articleId":"5611590","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5611594,"authors":[{"name":"Federico Barrero","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, University of Seville, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5947747/5611594/5611594-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Federico Barrero (M'04\u2013SM'05) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Seville, Seville, Spain, in 1992 and 1998, respectively.","In 1992, he joined the Electronic Engineering Department, University of Seville, where he is currently an Associate Professor.","Dr. Barrero received the Best Paper Award from the IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics in 2009."]},"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Barrero","id":"37294077800"},{"name":"Joel Prieto","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, University of Seville, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5947747/5611594/5611594-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Joel Prieto (S'10) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic engineering from the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n, Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, in 2005 and the M.Sc. degree from the University of Seville, Seville, Spain, in 2009, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","In 2008, he joined the Electronic Engineering Department, University of Seville.

Predictive control techniques have been recently introduced as a viable alternative to conventional PI controllers with carrier-based or space vector PWM techniques in the current regulation of multiphase power converters and drives. The developed schemes have demonstrated a good performance at the expense of a high computational cost, an unknown switching frequency, and the appearance of large undesirable stator current harmonic components. In this paper, an enhanced predictive current control technique with fixed switching frequency is introduced for an asymmetrical dual three-phase ac drive. Fast torque and current responses are achieved while favoring stator current harmonic suppression.

Short-circuit faults are among the common faults occurring in electrical machines. This paper presents a review of existing techniques available for online stator interturn fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in electrical machines. Special attention is given to short-circuit-fault diagnosis in permanent-magnet machines, which are fast replacing traditional machines in a wide variety of applications. Recent techniques that use signals analysis, models, or knowledge-based systems for FDD are reviewed in this paper. Motor current is the most commonly analyzed signal for fault diagnosis. Hence, motor current signature analysis is a topic of elaborate discussion in this paper. Additionally, parametric and finite-element models that were designed to simulate interturn-fault conditions are reviewed.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2089937","startPage":"1564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5747179/05611601.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2089937","endPage":"1575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5747179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent Advances in Modeling and Online Detection of Stator Interturn Faults in Electrical Motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611601/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"Recent Advances in Modeling and Online Detection of Stator Interturn Faults in Electrical Motors","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5611601/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11929562","dateOfInsertion":"11 April 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent Advances in Modeling and Online Detection of Stator Interturn Faults in Electrical Motors","sourcePdf":"tie-parsa-2089937-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100652S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5747179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"355","xplore-issue":"5747179","articleId":"5611601","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5611609,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Soldovieri","affiliation":["Institute of Electromagnetic Sensing of the Environment (IREA), National Research Council, Naples, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Francesco Soldovieri (M'10) received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering from the University of Salerno, Salerno, Italy, in 1992 and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Naples \u201cFederico II,\u201d Naples, Italy, in 1996.","In 2001, he became a Researcher with the Institute for Electromagnetic Sensing of the Environment (IREA), Italian National Research Council (CNR), Naples, where he has been a Senior Researcher since 2006.

However, the realization of such schemes for multihop wireless networks is challenging, owing to the requirement of coordination among nodes. As coordination through the use of feedback between nodes incurs significant bandwidth penalty, spectral efficiency can be improved by minimizing traffic in the feedback channel. This paper proposes an adaptive rate transmission scheme using incremental-redundancy-based cooperative coding that minimizes the required feedback. By exploiting the inherent implicit feedback channel during relaying, the spectral efficiency of multihop wireless networks can be improved considerably. Rather than allocating dedicated channels to feedback the quality of information at the relay, the implicit feedback channel measures such information and determines the transmitter for the additional coded (redundancy) bits. This optimizes the throughput. The proposed scheme is thoroughly analyzed under different deployment environments. Theoretical bounds for the proposed scheme are presented and supported with results from extensive simulation studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5611616/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11759896","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Throughput Optimization in Cooperative Communications Based on Incremental Relaying","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput Optimization in Cooperative Communications Based on Incremental Relaying","sourcePdf":"tvt-james-2089997-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042249S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5689379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5689379","articleId":"5611616","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5611617,"authors":[{"name":"Dongwoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Institute of New Media and Communications, Seoul National University of Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292976300"},{"name":"Jae Hong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Institute of New Media and Communications, Seoul National University of Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Hong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37336646300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5611617","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":107,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1528},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we analyze the dual-hop amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying systems with multiple interferers over Rayleigh fading channels.

Expressions for the average minimum power used to transmit are derived, and tradeoffs between the number of feedback bits, the number of users, and the number of transmit antennas are observed.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2089996","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5689379/05611618.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2089996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5689379","startPage":"349","endPage":"353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Power of MIMO Broadcast Systems Under SNR Constraints With Limited Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611618","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Power of MIMO Broadcast Systems Under SNR Constraints With Limited Feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611618/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11759879","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5611618/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Power of MIMO Broadcast Systems Under SNR Constraints With Limited Feedback","sourcePdf":"tvt-yue-2089996-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08121S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5689379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5689379","articleId":"5611618","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5611627,"authors":[{"name":"Ilker Deligoz","affiliation":["Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering Department, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5772996/5611627/5611627-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ilker Deligoz was born in Amasya, Turkey, in 1979.

Increasingly, computer control algorithms reside inside individual system components in a distributed fashion. Variable camshaft timing (VCT) is an appealing feature for automotive engines because it allows optimization of the cam timing over a wide range of operating conditions. In this paper, a method to distribute the discrete multiple-input mutiple-output controller for the VCT engine to improve the component swapping modularity of the VCT actuator and the EGO sensor components using network communications is presented. First, a discrete LQG controller is designed, and then this controller is distributed to the engine control unit, the VCT controller, and the EGO sensor controller in order to maximize the component swapping modularity of the system. A control oriented pre-optimization technique, which simplifies the optimization problem, and a candidate solution was devised to maximize component modularity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5611632/","accessionNumber":"12205996","displayDocTitle":"Swappable Distributed MIMO Controller for a VCT Engine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Swappable Distributed MIMO Controller for a VCT Engine","sourcePdf":"tcst-cakmakci-2080275-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.28211S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"5983465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5983465","articleId":"5611632","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5611635,"authors":[{"name":"Qammer Hussain Abbasi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5662237/5611635/5611635-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qammer Hussain Abbasi (S'09) received the degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan, in 2007.

In this paper, an experimental investigation is presented to derive suitable radio propagation models for ultra wideband (UWB) body-centric wireless communications. The performance of the body-centric UWB radio channel is investigated by considering several on-body links, including different body postures. System-level modeling of potential multiband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexed UWB system has been conducted and system performance is measured using bit error rate (BER) and signal-to-noise ratio. The conducted system analysis demonstrated that for 78% in the static case and 75% and 61% for stable and unstable transmitter locations in the pseudodynamic in-motion scenarios (respectively) of the specified on-body radio links, the BER is equal to or less than 0.1%. This demonstrates promising applications of the proposed UWB body-centric radio system. Based on these results, clear recommendations are given for best on-body locations leading to optimal system performance.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2010.2081491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5662237/05611635.pdf","startPage":"3485","endPage":"3492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2010.2081491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Body Radio Channel Characterization and System-Level Modeling for Multiband OFDM Ultra-Wideband Body-Centric Wireless Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611635/","displayDocTitle":"On-Body Radio Channel Characterization and System-Level Modeling for Multiband OFDM Ultra-Wideband Body-Centric Wireless Network","volume":"58","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11692659","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5611635/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Body Radio Channel Characterization and System-Level Modeling for Multiband OFDM Ultra-Wideband Body-Centric Wireless Network","sourcePdf":"tmtt-alomainy-2081491-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083448S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5662237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5662237","articleId":"5611635","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5611638,"authors":[{"name":"Yacine Chakhchoukh","affiliation":["Signal Processing Group at the Institute of Telecommunications, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany","RTE, DMA-Gestionnaire du R\u00e9seau de Transport dElectricit\u00e9 and L2S-Laboratoire des Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes, CNRS-SUPELEC-Universite Paris Sud XI, Paris, France"],"bio":{"p":["Yacine Chakhchoukh (M'10) received the engineering degree (with honors) from Ecole Polytechnique d'Alger, Algiers, Algeria, in 2004 and the M.S. degree (with honors) in control and signal processing and the Ph.D. degree (with honors) from the University of Paris-Sud XI, Paris, France, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","From June 2006 to September 2009, he was with Gestionnaire du R\u00e9seau de Transport d'Electricite (RTE, the French transmission system operator), working on statistical robust signal processing for load forecasting.

It is shown that the load time series exhibit lasting abrupt changes in the stochastic pattern, termed breaks. The goal is to propose an efficient and robust load forecasting method for prediction up to a day-ahead. To this end, two new robust procedures for outlier identification and suppression are developed. They are termed the multivariate ratio-of-medians-based estimator (RME) and the multivariate minimum-Hellinger-distance-based estimator (MHDE). The performance of the proposed methods has been evaluated on the French electric load time series in terms of execution times, ability to detect and suppress outliers, and forecasting accuracy. Their performances are compared with those of the robust methods proposed in the literature to estimate the parameters of SARIMA models and of the multiplicative double seasonal exponential smoothing. A new robust version of the latter is proposed as well. It is found that the RME approach outperforms all the other methods for \u201cnormal days\u201d and presents several interesting properties such as good robustness, fast execution, simplicity, and easy online implementation. Finally, to deal with heteroscedasticity, we propose a simple novel multivariate modeling that improves the quality of the forecast.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2080325","startPage":"982","endPage":"991","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5958775/05611638.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2080325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5958775","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electric Load Forecasting Based on Statistical Robust Methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Time series analysis","Load modeling","Predictive models","Mathematical model","Load forecasting","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","statistical analysis","stochastic processes","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric load forecasting","statistical robust methods","electric consumption","stochastic pattern","multivariate ratio-of-medians-based estimator","multivariate minimum-Hellinger-distance-based estimator","MHDE","SARIMA models","RME approach","electric load time series"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Outliers","robustness","SARIMA models","short- term load forecasting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Electric Load Forecasting Based on Statistical Robust Methods","volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5611638/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12175083","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electric Load Forecasting Based on Statistical Robust Methods","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-chakhchoukh-2080325-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073285S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5958775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5958775","articleId":"5611638","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":5611640,"authors":[{"name":"Leila Zia","affiliation":["Department of Management Science and Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Leila Zia is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Management Science & Engineering at Stanford University.

The redundancy allocation problem is a well-known nonlinear integer programming problem, which involves the maximization of system reliability by selecting components and redundancy levels as part of engineering design. The proposed solution method is based on the formulation of a restricted master problem and generation of possible better solutions through a set of sub-problems. The main advantages of our approach over previously studied heuristic methods are that it considers the objective function directly without any approximations, it has superior computation time, and it is flexible. Flexibility means that there is no need for assumptions like convexity and linearity of the objective function or constraints, restrictions on the number of constraints, and restrictions on component mixing. However, it is necessary to assume that the objective function and constraints are separable in decision variables. Numerical results are presented and discussed based on previously studied examples. The overall quality of the solutions matches or surpasses most of the existing heuristic methods with less computation time in the majority of the presented cases.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2010.2085530","doi":"10.1109/TR.2010.2085530","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel5/24/5629464/05611640.pdf","startPage":"706","endPage":"717","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Redundancy Allocation for Series-Parallel Systems Using a Column Generation Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Redundancy Allocation for Series-Parallel Systems Using a Column Generation Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11673955","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5611640/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Redundancy Allocation for Series-Parallel Systems Using a Column Generation Approach","sourcePdf":"tr-zia-2085530-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094517S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"24","isNumber":"5629464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5629464","articleId":"5611640","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5611641,"authors":[{"name":"Yee Jern Chong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6017244/5611641/5611641-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yee Jern Chong (S'08) received the B.E. degree with first-class honors in electrical & electronic engineering from the University of Canterbury, New Zealand in 2002; the M.Eng.Sc. degree in electrical engineering (microelectronics) and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia in 2004 and 2009 respectively.","His research interests include design automation, embedded systems, computer architecture and floating-point arithmetic circuits."]},"firstName":"Yee Jern","lastName":"Chong","id":"37585778300"},{"name":"Sri Parameswaran","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6017244/5611641/5611641-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Sri Parameswaran (M'92) received the B.E. degree from Monash University, Australia, in 1986 and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Queensland, Australia, in 1991.","He is a Professor with the School of Computer Science and Engineering, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, where he also serves as the Program Director for Computer Engineering.

Implementing floating-point units (FPUs) on FPGAs consume a large amount of resources. This makes FPGAs less attractive for use in floating-point intensive applications. Therefore, there is a need for embedded FPUs in FPGAs. However, if unutilized, embedded FPUs waste space on the FPGA die. To overcome this issue, we propose a flexible multimode embedded FPU for FPGAs that can be configured to perform a wide range of operations. The floating-point adder and multiplier in our embedded FPU can each be configured to perform one double-precision operation or two single-precision operations in parallel. To increase flexibility further, access to the large integer multiplier, adder and shifters in the FPU is provided. Benchmark circuits were implemented on both a standard Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA and on our FPGA with embedded FPU blocks. The results using our embedded FPUs showed a mean area improvement of 5.5 times and a mean delay improvement of 5.8 times for the double-precision benchmarks, and a mean area improvement of 3.8 times and a mean delay improvement of 4.2 times for the single-precision benchmarks.

Most of the adaptive beamformers presented in the ultrasound imaging literature are based on the minimum variance (MV) beamformer which can significantly improve the imaging resolution, although their success in enhancing the contrast has not yet been satisfactory. It is desirable for the beamformer to improve the resolution and contrast at the same time. To this end, in this paper, we have applied the eigenspace-based MV (EIBMV) beamformer to medical ultrasound imaging and have shown a simultaneous improvement in imaging resolution and contrast. EIBMV beamformer utilizes the eigenstructure of the covariance matrix to enhance the performance of the MV beamformer. The weight vector of the EIBMV is found by projecting the MV weight vector onto a vector subspace constructed from the eigenstructure of the covariance matrix. Using EIBMV weights instead of the MV ones leads to reduced sidelobes and improved contrast, without compromising the high resolution of the MV beamformer. In addition, the proposed EIBMV beamformer presents a satisfactory robustness against data misalignment resulting from steering vector errors, outperforming the regularized MV beamformer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611687/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","volume":"57","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"11615786","pubMedId":"21041127","publicationDate":"November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5611687/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Eigenspace-based minimum variance beamforming applied to medical ultrasound imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eigenspace-based minimum variance beamforming applied to medical ultrasound imaging","sourcePdf":"t10b2381.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085521S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5611678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"5611678","articleId":"5611687","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":5611689,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Zahiri Azar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/5611678/5611689/5611689-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Reza Zahiri Azar (S'05\u2013M'10) received the B.

To achieve sub-sample accuracy, the discrete pattern-matching function is interpolated using the values at the discrete maximizer and adjacent samples. In prior work, only 1-D fit, applied separately along the axial, lateral, and elevational axes, has been used to estimate the sub-sample motion in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D. In this paper, we explore the use of 2-D and 3-D polynomial fitting for this purpose. We quantify the estimation error in noise-free simulations using Field II and experiments with a commercial ultrasound machine. In simulated 2-D translational motions, function fitting with quartic spline polynomials leads to maximum bias of 0.2% of the sample spacing in the axial direction and 0.4% of the sample spacing in the lateral direction, corresponding to 38 nm and 1.31 \u03bcm, respectively. The maximum standard deviations were approximately 1% of the sample spacing in both the axial and the lateral directions, corresponding to 193 nm axially and 4.43 \u03bcm laterally. In simulated 1% axial strain, the same function fitting leads to mean absolute displacement estimation errors of 255 nm in the axial direction and 4.77 ?m in the lateral direction. In experiments with a linear array transducer, 2-D quartic spline fitting leads to maximum bias of 458 nm and 6.27 \u03bcm in the axial and the lateral directions, respectively. These results are more than one order of magnitude smaller than those obtained with separate 1-D fit when applied to the same data set. Simulations and experiments in 3-D yield similar results when comparing 3-D polynomial fitting with 1-D fitting along the axial, lateral, and elevational directions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Estimation","Discrete time systems","Time domain analysis","Solid modeling","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical transducers","biomedical ultrasonics","delay estimation","medical signal processing","pattern matching","splines (mathematics)","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain technique","delay estimation","subsample displacement estimation","digitized ultrasound RF signals","multidimensional polynomial fitting","cross-correlation function","discrete pattern-matching function","discrete maximizer","simulated 2-D translational motions","quartic spline polynomials","3-D polynomial fitting","linear array transducer","2-D quartic spline fitting"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Motion","Phantoms, Imaging","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Ultrasonography"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1708","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5611678/05611689.pdf","startPage":"2403","endPage":"2420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-sample displacement estimation from digitized ultrasound RF signals using multi-dimensional polynomial fitting of the cross-correlation function","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sub-sample displacement estimation from digitized ultrasound RF signals using multi-dimensional polynomial fitting of the cross-correlation function","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611689/","volume":"57","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5611689/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11615788","pubMedId":"21041129","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-sample displacement estimation from digitized ultrasound RF signals using multi-dimensional polynomial fitting of the cross-correlation function","sourcePdf":"t10b2403.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116158S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5611678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5611678","articleId":"5611689","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5611691,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Unlike most error sources, decorrelation is coherent over time and has the same power spectrum as the signal. Thus, reducing decorrelation is impossible through frequency domain filtering or simple averaging and must be achieved through other methods. In this paper, we present a novel motion estimator, termed the principal component displacement estimator (PCDE), which takes advantage of the signal separation capabilities of principal component analysis (PCA) to reject decorrelation and noise. Furthermore, PCDE only requires the computation of a single principal component, enabling computational speed that is on the same order of magnitude or faster than the commonly used Loupas algorithm. Unlike prior PCA strategies, PCDE uses complex data to generate motion estimates using only a single principal component. The use of complex echo data is critical because it allows for separation of signal components based on motion, which is revealed through phase changes of the complex principal components. PCDE operates on the assumption that the signal component of interest is also the most energetic component in an ensemble of echo data. This assumption holds in most clinical ultrasound environments. However, in environments where electronic noise SNR is less than 0 dB or in blood flow data for which the wall signal dominates the signal from blood flow, the calculation of more than one PC is required to obtain the signal of interest. We simulated synthetic ultrasound data to assess the performance of PCDE over a wide range of imaging conditions and in the presence of decorrelation and additive noise. Under typical ultrasonic elasticity imaging conditions (0.98 signal correlation, 25 dB SNR, 1 sample shift), PCDE decreased estimation bias by more than 10% and standard deviation by more than 30% compared with the Loupas method and normalized cross-correlation with cosine fitting (NC CF). More modest gains were observed relative to spline-based time delay estimation (sTDE). PCDE was also tested on experimental elastography data. Compressions of approximately 1.5% were applied to a CIRS elastography phantom with embedded 10.4-mmdiameter lesions that had moduli contrasts of -9.2, -5.9, and 12.0 dB. The standard deviation of displacement estimates was reduced by at least 67% in homogeneous regions at 35 to 40 mm in depth with respect to estimates produced by Loupas, NC CF, and sTDE. Greater improvements in CNR and displacement standard deviation were observed at larger depths where speckle decorrelation and other noise sources were more significant.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611691/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","volume":"57","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"11615790","pubMedId":"21041131","publicationDate":"November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5611691/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Complex principal components for robust motion estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex principal components for robust motion estimation","sourcePdf":"t10b2437.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090694S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5611678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5611678","articleId":"5611691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5611694,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Lavarello","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA","Secci\u00f3n Electricidad y Electr\u00f3nica, Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Per\u00fa, Lima, Peru"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/5611678/5611694/5611694-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roberto Lavarello was born in Lima, Per\u00fa, in 1978.

In this work, an improved approach, termed the multiple-frequency distorted Born iterative method (MF-DBIM) algorithm, was developed for imaging density variations. The MF-DBIM approach consists of inverting the wave equation by solving for a single function that depends on both sound speed and density variations at multiple frequencies. Density information was isolated by using a linear combination of the reconstructed single-frequency profiles. Reconstructions of targets using MF-DBIM from simulated data were compared with reconstructions using methods currently available in the literature, i.e., the dual-frequency DBIM (DF-DBIM) and T-matrix approaches. Useful density reconstructions, i.e., root mean square errors (RMSEs) less than 30%, were obtained with MF-DBIM even with 2% Gaussian noise in the simulated data and using frequency ranges spanning less than an order of magnitude. Therefore, the MFDBIM approach outperformed both the DF-DBIM method (which has problems converging with noise even an order of magnitude smaller) and the T-matrix method (which requires a ka factor close to unity to achieve convergence). However, the convergence of all the density imaging algorithms was compromised when imaging targets with object functions exhibiting high spatial frequency content.","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5611678/05611694.pdf","startPage":"2471","endPage":"2479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1713","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2010.1713","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611694","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Density measurement","Bandwidth","Frequency estimation","Acoustics","Convergence","Inverse problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["density","Gaussian noise","iterative methods","ultrasonic imaging","wave equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["density imaging","multiple frequency DBIM","inverse scattering","distorted Born iterative method","MF-DBIM approach","wave equation","T-matrix approach","Gaussian noise","spatial frequency content"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Phantoms, Imaging","Tomography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611694/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"Density imaging using a multiple-frequency DBIM approach","accessionNumber":"11615781","pubMedId":"21041134","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5611694/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Density imaging using a multiple-frequency DBIM approach","sourcePdf":"t10b2471.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157572S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5611678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5611678","articleId":"5611694","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":5611703,"authors":[{"name":"Michio Kadota","affiliation":["Murata Manufacturing Company Limited, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/5611678/5611703/5611703-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michio Kadota (M'97\u2013SM'07\u2013F'09) received the B.S., M.S, and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.

This constraint can introduce many fabrication difficulties, particularly in the development of high-frequency phased arrays at operating frequencies greater than 30 MHz. In this paper, a new transmit beamforming technique along with sign coherence factor (SCF) receive beamforming is proposed to suppress grating lobes in large-pitch phased-array transducers. It is based on splitting the transmit aperture (N elements) into N/K transmit elements and receive beamforming on all N elements to reduce the temporal length of the transmit grating lobe signal. Therefore, the use of synthetic aperture beamforming, which can introduce relative phase distortions between the echoes received over many transmit events, can be avoided. After each transmit-receive event, the received signals are weighted by the calculated SCF to suppress the grating lobes. After pulsing all sub-apertures, the RF signals are added to generate one line of the image. Simulated 2-way radiation patterns for different K values show that grating lobes can be suppressed significantly at different steering angles. Grating lobes can be suppressed by approximately 20 dB with K = 2 at steering angles greater than 25\u00b0 and an element pitch greater than 0.75\u03bb. A technique for determining the optimal transmit sub-apertures has been developed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611706/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","volume":"57","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"11615803","pubMedId":"21041146","publicationDate":"November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5611706/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A split-aperture transmit beamforming technique with phase coherence grating lobe suppression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A split-aperture transmit beamforming technique with phase coherence grating lobe suppression","sourcePdf":"t10b2588.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063154S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5611678","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5611678","articleId":"5611706","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5611751,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Guojin","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Guojin","id":"37299529900"},{"name":"Li Yongning","affiliation":["School of Management, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Yongning","id":"37542352300"},{"name":"Zhu Miaofen","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Miaofen","id":"37299531000"},{"name":"Wang Wanqiang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Wanqiang","id":"37542357500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7230-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7228-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7229-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1547"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-1555"}],"articleNumber":"5611751","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611751","abstract":"According to the image feature extraction capacity based on wavelet transformation and the nonlinear, self-adaptive and pattern recognition capacity based on artificial neural networks, the image auto-focusing method based on artificial neural networks is put forward.

Several spectral transformations using binned energy windows can help alleviate the negative effect from background spectral noisy variation. The simplest way for such spectral partition is to use a fixed bin-width for uniform partition.

The proposed type-2 fuzzy membership function has certain values on 0 and 1, but it has some uncertainties for the other membership values. It has been shown that the type-2 fuzzy system using this type of membership function introduced in this study has some noise reduction property in the presence of noisy inputs. The appropriate parameter selection to be able to achieve noise reduction property is also considered. A hybrid method consisting of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and gradient descent (GD) algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the proposed type-2 fuzzy system. PSO is a derivative-free optimizer, and the possibility of the entrapment of this optimizer in local minimums is less than the gradient descent method. The proposed type-2 fuzzy system and the hybrid parameter estimation method are then tested on the prediction of a noisy, chaotic dynamical system. The simulation results show that the type-2 fuzzy predictor with the proposed novel membership functions shows a superior performance when compared to the other existing type-2 fuzzy systems in the presence of noisy inputs.","doi":"10.1109/CIMSA.2010.5611774","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications","startPage":"128","endPage":"133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMSA.2010.5611774","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611748","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605057/5611748/05611774.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Signal to noise ratio","Noise measurement","Uncertainty","Training","Chaos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","fuzzy systems","gradient methods","noise abatement","nonlinear control systems","parameter estimation","particle swarm optimisation","prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["type-2 fuzzy membership function","noisy data","uncertainties","noise reduction property","parameter selection","particle swarm optimization","gradient descent algorithm","derivative-free optimizer","parameter estimation","chaotic dynamical system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel type-2 fuzzy membership function: application to the prediction of noisy data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611774/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5611774/","accessionNumber":"11625168","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel type-2 fuzzy membership function: application to the prediction of noisy data","confLoc":"Taranto, Italy","sourcePdf":"1569330638.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051523S","chronDate":"6-8 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605057","isNumber":"5611748","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605057","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5611748","articleId":"5611774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5611806,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaogang Yang","affiliation":["Engineering Center of Digital Audio and Video, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37534306400"},{"name":"Weitao Du","affiliation":["Engineering Center of Digital Audio and Video, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weitao","lastName":"Du","id":"37532599700"},{"name":"Zhanxin Yang","affiliation":["Engineering Center of Digital Audio and Video, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhanxin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37406201100"},{"name":"Rui Lv","affiliation":["Engineering Center of Digital Audio and Video, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Lv","id":"37394100800"},{"name":"Xiaoguang Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoguang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37601026300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6903-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6904-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5611806","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":268},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Hardware","Signal to noise ratio","Signal processing algorithms","Random access memory","Algorithm design and analysis","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","digital television","fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","television transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware design","hardware implementation","FFT","FPGA","DTTB transmitter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FFT","PFA","WFTA","3780"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a hardware scheme based on FPGA to implement the 3780 points FFT.

This paper reports the results of double directional sounding measurements made in downtown Ottawa to obtain the needed information. Narrowband small scale fading is modelled as Rayleigh or Rician, coherence bandwidths are reported, and an equation is given through which close approximations to experimentally-determined powerweighted AOA and AOD histograms can be reproduced. A recent literature search revealed that such results, all estimated from the same measurements, have not previously been reported.","doi":"10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5611887","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605020/5611808/05611887.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5611887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611808","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double directional radio propagation measurements and radio channel modelling pertinent to mobile MIMO communications in microcells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Double directional radio propagation measurements and radio channel modelling pertinent to mobile MIMO communications in microcells","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611887/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11624966","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5611887/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double directional radio propagation measurements and radio channel modelling pertinent to mobile MIMO communications in microcells","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"WITS1248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055174S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605020","isNumber":"5611808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605020","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5611808","articleId":"5611887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5611889,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Mueck","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies, Neubiberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Mueck","id":"37391758300"},{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["L2S, UMR 8506 CNRS SUPELEC, Universite Paris-Sud, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Di Renzo","id":"37391990500"},{"name":"M\u00e9rouane Debbah","affiliation":["SUPELEC, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"M\u00e9rouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"},{"name":"Tobias Renk","affiliation":["Karlsruher Institut f\u00fcr Technologie, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Renk","id":"37301855300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7092-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7091-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7090-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5611889","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["TV","Distributed databases","White spaces","Relays","Sensors","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","database management systems","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decentralized database","centralized database","terminal-based spectrum sensing","secondary spectrum access","distributed spectrum sensing method","TV white space","opportunistic spectrum access"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611889","abstract":"In this paper, we have proposed the combination of a centralized & decentralized database and distributed spectrum sensing method for secondary spectrum access.

Different from other relay systems, we adopt RF band phase shift beamforming to adjust phases of RF signal before modulating it into an optical band.

In the designed system, the relay station performs training towards mobile devices by sending training sequences from each of pre-defined transmit beam patterns, then mobile devices indicate training index to the relay station when the received signal strength is maximized. A cross layer design is proposed, which not only improves system transmission performance with a very short beamforming setup time, but also provides a safe propagation environment, which would open a new vista to solve the wireless communication in RF sensitive area.","doi":"10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5611897","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605020/5611808/05611897.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5611897","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A cross layer design for optical relay system employing RF subcarrier beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","displayDocTitle":"A cross layer design for optical relay system employing RF subcarrier beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611897/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5611897/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11624976","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cross layer design for optical relay system employing RF subcarrier beamforming","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"WITS1262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03754S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605020","isNumber":"5611808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605020","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5611808","articleId":"5611897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5611900,"authors":[{"name":"Paschalis C.

A two-tone excitation signal with equal amplitudes and a frequency spacing of 10 MHz is adopted in this simulation. For comparison, both the measurement results of the proposed PA without EER linearization technology at a constant drain bias of 35 V with two test signals at 995 MHz and 1005 MHz and the proposed PA with EER linearization technology are given. According to the Fig. 3(a), compared to the PA without EER, the output power of the PA with EER declines less than 1 dBm on average. However, the IMD3 is improved significantly by using EER linearization technology. Fig. 3(b) shows the IMD3 characteristics versus output power. It is showed that the IMD3 of the class-E PA with EER is improved by 12 dB on average than the IMD3 of the PA without EER, and the best improvement of 14.9 dB is achieved at the output power of 38 dBm. As showed in Fig. 3 (c), the IMD3 of the class-E PA has improvement of 17.4 dBm at the input power of 21 dBm, compared to the class-E PA without EER. Fig. 3 (d) shows that the class-E PA with EER has a much lower IMD3 than the PA without EER at the same level of gain. The results demonstrate that by using the EER linearization technology, the linearity of the class-E PA with an ASF is improved obviously.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5611919/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11625000","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel class-E power amplifier with an asymmetrical spurline filter and its linearization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel class-E power amplifier with an asymmetrical spurline filter and its linearization","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"WITS1286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043368S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605020","isNumber":"5611808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605020","xplore-issue":"5611808","articleId":"5611919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5611922,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin R.

The scheme combines cryptographic technique implemented in higher layers with data assurance analysis at the physical layer to provide better security. The scheme can, of course, be used for a traditional non-cooperative MIMO network. First, the authors show an efficient key management system that can provide secured communication and routing with a small number of keys shared between the clusters which cooperate on data transmission and reception. Then, the authors show a novel approach that can detect and identify compromised nodes in transmission process at physic layer. By key revocation the compromised nodes are discarded and the clusters/virtual MIMO nodes are self-reconfigured. The primary evaluation shows that the key management system can secure communication and routing with small number of keys, and the approach for detecting compromised nodes is very effective.","doi":"10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5611952","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605020/5611808/05611952.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5611952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layered design of security scheme for cooperative MIMO sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611952/","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layered design of security scheme for cooperative MIMO sensor networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11625033","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5611952/","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layered design of security scheme for cooperative MIMO sensor networks","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"WITS1026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057149S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605020","isNumber":"5611808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605020","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5611808","articleId":"5611952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5611959,"authors":[{"name":"Hendrik Bayer","affiliation":["RF & Microwave Research Laboratory, Institute for Information Technology, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Hendrik","lastName":"Bayer","id":"37530873200"},{"name":"Christian Volmer","affiliation":["RF & Microwave Research Laboratory, Institute for Information Technology, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Volmer","id":"37319050700"},{"name":"Alexander Krau\u00df","affiliation":["RF & Microwave Research Laboratory, Institute for Information Technology, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Krau\u00df","id":"37393644400"},{"name":"Ralf Stephan","affiliation":["RF & Microwave Research Laboratory, Institute for Information Technology, Ilmenau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Stephan","id":"37268269700"},{"name":"Matthias A.

We discuss beamforming technique with application to the passive radar system. For realization issue, adaptive beamforming technique can be used to detect and estimate the signal-of-interest at the output of a sensor array by means of the adaptive spatial filter to suppress interference. Specially, the adaptive beamformer based on constrained least mean squares algorithm has been derived which is capable of adjusting an array of sensors in real time to detect the signal-of-interest and eliminate interference. We will exploit the space-time processing algorithm for the passive radar system, in order to increase the degrees of freedom without limiting the system output SINR. For more efficient and practical implementation, the proposed space-time beamformer can be realized by the recursively adaptive algorithm with multiple constraints. Finally, the proposed space-time beamformer can be operated in multiple linear constraint mode to combat the angle mismatch problem. From simulation result, it is shown that the multiple constraint space-time beamformer provides better OSINR performance with resistance to strong interferences.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5611972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611808","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605020/5611808/05611972.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive space-time beamforming technique for passive radar system with ultra low signal to interference ratio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5611972/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive space-time beamforming technique for passive radar system with ultra low signal to interference ratio","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11625052","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive space-time beamforming technique for passive radar system with ultra low signal to interference ratio","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"WITS1061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05309S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605020","isNumber":"5611808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605020","xplore-issue":"5611808","articleId":"5611972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5611974,"authors":[{"name":"Jeng-Kuang Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jeng-Kuang","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37280973600"},{"name":"Kuei-Hong Lin","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kuei-Hong Lin","id":"37596509600"},{"name":"Yu-Lun Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Lun Chiu","id":"37292303500"},{"name":"Jeng-Da Li","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jeng-Da Li","id":"37578301400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7092-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7091-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7090-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5611974","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Noise","OFDM","Channel estimation","Attenuation","Frequency domain analysis","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","iterative methods","maximum likelihood estimation","multipath channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","multipath channel sounding","fractional delays","T/2-spaced sampling","iteration","EDC criterion","CFR-MSE"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an OFDM-based high resolution, channel sounding (CS) method is proposed under T/2-spaced sampling.

Simulations validate the feasibility from the aspects of timing synchronization probability and CFO's mean square error (MSE).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective synchronization scheme for NC-OFDM systems in cognitive radio context","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5611980","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605020/5611808/05611980.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5611980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","displayDocTitle":"An effective synchronization scheme for NC-OFDM systems in cognitive radio context","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5611980/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11624822","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective synchronization scheme for NC-OFDM systems in cognitive radio context","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"WITS1073.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058771S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605020","isNumber":"5611808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605020","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5611808","articleId":"5611980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5611982,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Gao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Pei Gao","id":"37586300900"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Jun Wang","id":"37292913800"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Shaoqian Li","id":"37279617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7092-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7091-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7090-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5611982","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Peak to average power ratio","Context","Data communication","Frequency diversity","Delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","data communication","error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncontiguous CI-OFDM","cognitive radio","CR","noncontiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","data transmission","BER","PAPR","carrier interferometry OFDM"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the authors propose to apply non-contiguous CI/OFDM (NC-CI/OFDM) as a new data transmission scheme for CR context.

The goal was to transmit a signal with the maximum available power and then observe whether the received signal contained a portion of the transmitted signal. A matched filter was then designed using the transmitted waveform to detect the received signal and based on some statistical hypothesis testing a decision was made on whether a target is present or absent. However, when multiple targets are to be examined or one wants to search for a low observable near a large target, the conventional detection based radar processing is not adequate. A need for finding small targets in the presence of clutter and jammer evolved into an estimation theory problem rather than detection. It is illustrated that use of a phased array in a SIMO mode can perform quite well as one does not have to worry about the inhomogenity of the clutter associated with multiple transmissions in a MIMO system as the processing becomes quite complicated. Also, the compensation of mutual coupling becomes difficult in a practical deployment on a moving platform. It is important to note that one can still exploit the advantages of super-resolution processing using estimation theory keeping the advantages of a single high power transmitting antenna in a phased array deployment. This paper illustrates such a methodology which has been in the published literature for at least a decade and compares it with the recent MIMO developments. Examples are presented related to a single snapshot based least squares methodology that can cancel interferer in the main beam using a phased array radar but performing a deterministic processing using the same number of degrees of freedom as a multisnapshot case for coherent processing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO radars or is it smart antennas?","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5611988","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605020/5611808/05611988.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5611988","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5611988/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","displayDocTitle":"MIMO radars or is it smart antennas?","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5611988/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11624830","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO radars or is it smart antennas?","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"WITS1085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03482S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605020","isNumber":"5611808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605020","xplore-issue":"5611808","articleId":"5611988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5611991,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"lastName":"Yang Liu","id":"37405162000"},{"name":"Zhiyong Feng","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Innovation Institutes WTI, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Zhiyong Feng","id":"37536937000"},{"name":"Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Technology Innovation Institutes WTI, Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Ping Zhang","id":"37274503400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7092-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7091-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7090-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5611991","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic repeat request","Network coding","Mathematical model","Equations","Markov processes","Cognitive radio","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","cognitive radio","network coding","radio broadcasting","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coding","cognitive radio network","cognitive radio broadcast","CR basestation","lost packet","ARQ broadcast retransmission","CR network","CR channel","broadcast cost","NC-ARQ scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio Networks","Broadcast","Network Coding","ARQ","Markov Model"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel ARQ scheme based on Network Coding Theory in Cognitive Radio networks","doi":"10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5611991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611808","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605020/5611808/05611991.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5611991","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5611991","abstract":"In this paper, Network Coding (NC) Theory is introduced to improve efficiency of the traditional ARQ scheme for Cognitive Radio (CR) broadcast, named as NC-ARQ, in which we consider making the CR basestation combine the lost packets during ARQ broadcast retransmission in CR networks (CRN), with the changeable availability of CR channel.

By using optimum back-gate biasing scheme for each transistor, the proposed SRAM cell achieves the best overall performance considering noise margin, delay and power. Compared with traditional subthreshold CNFET SRAM cell, the proposed SRAM cell increases static voltage noise margin (SVNM) 36%, increases static current noise margin (SINM) 2.5X, and reduces delay 61% with power consumption increasing only 1% for read operation. For write operation, the proposed SRAM cell increases write noise margin (WNM) 2.5X and reduces power consumption and delay 17% and 56% respectively compared with traditional subthreshold CNFET SRAM cell. In terms of total number of nanotubes (area) of CNFET SRAM cell, the proposed subthreshold CNFET SRAM cell can reduce at least half of total number of nanotubes without compromising noise margin, power and delay. New CNFET SRAM cell structure is proposed to dynamically bias each transistor at different operation modes.","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2010.5612103","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5599908/5612082/05612103.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2010.5612103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5612082","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5612103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel CNFET SRAM cell design operating in sub-threshold region using back-gate biasing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5612103/","displayDocTitle":"Novel CNFET SRAM cell design operating in sub-threshold region using back-gate biasing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5612103/","publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2010","accessionNumber":"11616569","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel CNFET SRAM cell design operating in sub-threshold region using back-gate biasing","confLoc":"Normal, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"Nan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049452S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5599908","isNumber":"5612082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5599908","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5612082","articleId":"5612103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5612106,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Monroe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Bradley University, Peoria, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Monroe","id":"37400624100"},{"name":"In Soo Ahn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Bradley University, Peoria, IL, USA"],"firstName":"In Soo","lastName":"Ahn","id":"38246121200"},{"name":"Yufeng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Bradley University, Peoria, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yufeng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37292929200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6875-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6873-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6874-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"5612106","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Adaptation model","Clutter","Time frequency analysis","Noise cancellation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","backscatter","clutter","interference suppression","signal detection","ultrasonic applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filtering","target detection","ultrasonic backscattered signal","clutter rejection","noise cancellation","detection capability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive filter","ultrasonic backscattered signal","grain noise"]}],"abstract":"In radar, sonar, medical ultrasound, and ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation, environmental noise makes target detection challenging.

To reduce the optimization complexity of the increased technology parameters, in this paper, we proposed a novel curve fitting design methodology for carbon-nanotube circuits. The proposed curve fitting methodology can guarantee from 90% to 100% correlation accuracy comparing with SPICE simulation and it can find optimal CNFET SRAM cell parameters without exhaustive simulation time and large memory space. The optimized CNFET SRAM cell by the proposed methodology shows that total power consumption including static power is reduced by 83.14% and the total PDP (product of delay and power) is reduced by 83.39%, comparing with CMOS SRAM cell design. The total runtime is reduced by 96.9% compared with conventional Monte Carlo simulation method in SPICE.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Electro/Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5599908/5612082/05612138.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel curve fitting design methodology for carbon nanotube SRAM cell optimization","doi":"10.1109/EIT.2010.5612138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5612082","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIT.2010.5612138","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5612138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5612138/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Novel curve fitting design methodology for carbon nanotube SRAM cell optimization","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11616600","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5612138/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel curve fitting design methodology for carbon nanotube SRAM cell optimization","confLoc":"Normal, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"Wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097873S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5599908","isNumber":"5612082","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5599908","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5612082","articleId":"5612138","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5612181,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Aljaafreh","firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Aljaafreh","id":"37400566400"},{"name":"Liang Dong","firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Dong","id":"37401031400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6875-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6873-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6874-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-0373"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-0357"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-0357"}],"articleNumber":"5612181","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Vehicles","Wireless sensor networks","Mathematical model","Acoustics","Feature extraction","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","expectation-maximisation algorithm","Gaussian processes","hidden Markov models","military vehicles","sensor arrays","signal classification","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ground vehicle classification","Gaussian mixture model","wireless sensor networks","audio sensor arrays","hierarchical hidden Markov model","HHMM","vehicle acoustic signals","expectation maximization","maximum likelihood approach"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, multiple ground vehicles passing through a region that are observed by audio sensor arrays are efficiently classified using a Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM).

The output of the states of this HMM is modeled as Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), where the number of states and the number of Gaussians are experimentally determined, while the other parameters are estimated using Expectation Maximization (EM).

Although there are multi-channel multi-interface nodes in the wireless ad hoc networks, the set of each node's available channels is fixed, or even the same. With a fixed and static available channel set, the researchers can consider the MAC layer has already provided error-free data link for the up-layer applications. Therefore, it is not necessary to take the underlying link problems related to channel access into account during the routing protocol design. In cognitive radio networks, nodes achieve the dynamic access of available spectrum by sensing the spectrum hole. When the primary user appears in the authorized band, the secondary users must give up the occupied channel, thus resulting in the available channel set of the cognitive radio terminals changing with time and space location, and the available channel set of each node different from each other at the same time. The dynamic change of the available channel set brings about the dynamic change of physical link connectivity, thus making the routing based on it is also on highly dynamic. When one node has multiple wireless interfaces, the routing will become even more subtle. It is important to take the influence on the performance of routing protocol introduced by the spectrum allocation into account.","doi":"10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5612281","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605020/5611808/05612281.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5612281","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A collision-free resident channel selection based solution for deafness problem in the cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5612281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","displayDocTitle":"A collision-free resident channel selection based solution for deafness problem in the cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5612281/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5612281/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11624946","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A collision-free resident channel selection based solution for deafness problem in the cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"WITS1106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051018S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605020","isNumber":"5611808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605020","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5611808","articleId":"5612281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5612290,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The MIMO relay network would provide an excellent information service with high data rate and ubiquitous coverage. But the performance of the MIMO relay network is heavily dependent on the diversity gain brought by the use of multiple relay nodes, which is denoted as the multi-relays gain. The signal relaying scheme adopted by relay nodes is the key to exploit the multi-relays gain. There are many research results on the signal relaying scheme of MIMO relay network, such as AF, ZF, SVD, MF, MMSE relaying schemes. But previous literatures didn't give a comprehensive reason on the causing of multi-relays gain in different relaying schemes. In this paper, a space rotation method is proposed to exploit the causing of multi-relays gain in MIMO relay network. On this basis, a unified relaying structure is given out, which should be satisfied at relay nodes in order to obtain the multi-relays gain. Furthermore, we use the unified relaying structure to analyze the performance of the existing relaying schemes, and a new ASVD relaying scheme is designed for the MIMO relay network which is analogous to the SVD relaying scheme. Numerical results have verified the validity of the unified relaying structure and the ASVD relaying scheme is superior to existing relaying schemes in the capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605020/5611808/05612294.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Wireless Information Technology and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5612294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWITS.2010.5612294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5611808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5612294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified relaying structure for the MIMO relay network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Filtering","Matrix decomposition","Gallium nitride","Signal to noise ratio","Diversity methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","MIMO communication","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified relaying structure","MIMO relay network","relay node","amplify-and-forward relaying strategy","information service","data rate","ubiquitous coverage","diversity gain","multirelays gain","signal relaying","space rotation","ASVD relaying scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5612294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","displayDocTitle":"Unified relaying structure for the MIMO relay network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5612294/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11624959","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","conferenceDate":"28 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified relaying structure for the MIMO relay network","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"WITS1096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049885S","chronDate":"Aug. 28 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605020","isNumber":"5611808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605020","xplore-issue":"5611808","articleId":"5612294","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5612329,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It has the advantages of much faster training process and more accurate results using the minimum Bayesian risk criterion compared with other neural networks. In this paper, we use this neural network in brain-machine interface for decoding neural ensemble activity. Rats were trained to perform a lever pressing task for water rewards and implanted a chronic 16-channel microelectrode array in the primary motor cortex. The multi-channel neural activity and pressure signal of the lever was recorded simultaneously. In the PNN architecture, input vector was modified and contained not only current neuronal activity but also previously estimated pressure value which was taken as one input. This modified PNN was implemented in Matlab and obtained a good performance. Furthermore, field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based hardware implementation of PNN were developed and tested with real data. Because of the parallel computation ability and optimized architecture of FPGA, the results are as accurate as the realization of Matlab-based but the running speed is much faster. This indicates that the performance of current FPGA is competent for portable BMI applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic neural network based motor cortical decoding method and hardware implementation","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Aided Control System Design","doi":"10.1109/CACSD.2010.5612649","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Computer-Aided Control System Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/5604774/5612639/05612649.pdf","startPage":"2267","endPage":"2271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CACSD.2010.5612649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5612639","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5612649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5612649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic neural network based motor cortical decoding method and hardware implementation","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5612649/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11624538","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic neural network based motor cortical decoding method and hardware implementation","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"0578.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056286S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5604774","isNumber":"5612639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5604774","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5612639","articleId":"5612649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5612674,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The control law is derived according to the online neural network estimation of the sensory function of the environments. In contrary to previous adaptive approaches, a major advantage of the proposed method is that due to the neural network nonlinear approximation property, it is not restricted to multi Gaussian sensory functions. Simulation results show that the proposed controller outperforms the previous adaptive approaches in the sense of performance and convergence rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5612871/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11624423","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5612871/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Coverage control for mobile sensing robots in unknown environments using neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage control for mobile sensing robots in unknown environments using neural network","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"0461.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073399S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5604772","isNumber":"5612700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5604772","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5612700","articleId":"5612871","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5612881,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

A Lypaunov based singularity free control law, which compensates for parametric uncertainty in both the drift vector and the input gain matrix, is proposed under the mild assumption that the signs of the leading minors of the control input gain matrix are known. Lyapunov analysis shows global uniform ultimate boundedness (GUUB) result for the tracking error under full state feedback (FSFB). Under the restriction that only the output vector is available for measurement, an output feedback (OFB) controller is designed based on a standard high gain observer (HGO) - stability under OFB is fostered by the uniformity of the FSFB solution. Simulation results for both FSFB and OFB controllers demonstrate the efficacy of the MIMO control design in the classical 2-DOF robot manipulator model.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/5604772/5612700/05612881.pdf","startPage":"2284","endPage":"2289","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.2010.5612881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.2010.5612881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5612700","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5612881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust adaptive control design for a class of uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix decomposition","MIMO","Control design","Symmetric matrices","Adaptive control","Output feedback","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","Lyapunov methods","manipulators","matrix algebra","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","observers","robust control","state feedback","uncertain systems","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust adaptive control design","uncertain multiinput multioutput nonlinear systems","Lyapunov based singularity free control law","drift vector","control input gain matrix","global uniform ultimate boundedness","full state feedback","output feedback controller","standard high gain observer","classical 2-DOF robot manipulator model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5612881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Robust adaptive control design for a class of uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5612881/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11624429","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust adaptive control design for a class of uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"0530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075759S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5604772","isNumber":"5612700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5604772","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5612700","articleId":"5612881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5612889,"authors":[{"name":"Tadashi Kondo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Tadashi","lastName":"Kondo","id":"37281328200"},{"name":"Junji Ueno","affiliation":["Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Junji","lastName":"Ueno","id":"37590226800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5360-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5361-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-9860"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-9879"}],"articleNumber":"5612889","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5612889","abstract":"The feedback Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)-type neural network algorithm is proposed and is applied to the nonlinear system identification.

As we assume that the states are not measurable, a sliding window of measurements is introduced to design the iterative learning controller without state observer. Based on a derived error model, a fuzzy neural network using sliding window of measurement is introduced to design a fuzzy neural learning component. It is used to overcome the design difficulty in dealing with the certainty equivalent controller. On the other hand, an averaging filter approach is adopted to design a robust learning component. It will compensate for the uncertainties due to fuzzy neural approximation error, input disturbance and state estimation errors. A Lyapunov like analysis is applied to show that all the adjustable parameters as well as internal signals remain bounded for all iterations. Furthermore, the norm of output tracking error will asymptotically converge to a tunable residual set as iteration goes to infinity.","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.2010.5612898","pdfPath":"/iel5/5604772/5612700/05612898.pdf","startPage":"783","endPage":"788","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.2010.5612898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5612700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Output based direct adaptive iterative learning control for nonlinear systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5612898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Output based direct adaptive iterative learning control for nonlinear systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11624446","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5612898/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Output based direct adaptive iterative learning control for nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"0283.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091638S","chronDate":"8-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5604772","isNumber":"5612700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5604772","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5612700","articleId":"5612898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5612932,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos E.

This paper describes THOR (Transparent Heterogeneous Open Resources), our framework for providing seamless access to HPC systems composed of heterogeneous resources. Our work focuses on the core module, in particular the policy engine. To validate our approach, THOR has been implemented on a scaled-down heterogeneous cluster within a cloud-based computational environment. Our testing includes an Open CL encryption/decryption algorithm that was tested for several use cases. The corresponding computational benchmarks are provided to validate our approach and gain valuable knowledge for the policy database.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Graphics processing unit","Measurement","Throughput","Computer architecture","Engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","cryptography","multiprocessing systems","open systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transparent heterogeneous open resource framework","heterogeneous computing","multicore CPU","hardware accelerator","GPU hardware","cloud computing","Open CL encryption-decryption algorithm","policy database","mixed architectures"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613099","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTERWKSP.2010.5613099","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference On Cluster Computing Workshops and Posters (CLUSTER WORKSHOPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606060/5613076/05613099.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTERWKSP.2010.5613099","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613076","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference On Cluster Computing Workshops and Posters (CLUSTER WORKSHOPS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"THOR: A Transparent Heterogeneous Open Resource framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"THOR: A Transparent Heterogeneous Open Resource framework","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613099/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613099/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11623598","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"THOR: A Transparent Heterogeneous Open Resource framework","confLoc":"Heraklion, Greece","sourcePdf":"hpccepaper6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063127S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606060","isNumber":"5613076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606060","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5613076","articleId":"5613099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5613105,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Hofmann","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Hofmann","id":"37391051700"},{"name":"Gudula R\u00fcnger","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Gudula","lastName":"R\u00fcnger","id":"37281780700"},{"name":"Paul Gibbon","affiliation":["J\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, Germany"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Gibbon","id":"37353067400"},{"name":"Robert Speck","affiliation":["J\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Speck","id":"37540946200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8396-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8395-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8397-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5613105","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Computational modeling","Load modeling","Memory management","Arrays","Partitioning algorithms","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","parallel processing","physics computing","resource allocation","sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel sorting algorithms","particle simulations optimization","parallel implementations","parallel sorting","load balancing","PEPC","IBM Blue Gene","P system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle simulations","parallel sorting","load balancing","data redistribution","performance optimization"]}],"abstract":"Real world particle simulation codes have to handle a huge number of particles and their interactions.

The next step should be the identification of some patterns in these use cases that will be finally exposed to the developers as blocks (templates of the API) for building complex Cloud-based applications.

The price paid for such a wealth of spectral information is the enormous amounts of data to be processed. In recent years, several efforts have been directed towards the incorporation of high-performance computing models in remote sensing missions. For this purpose, graphics processing units (GPUs) have emerged as a very interesting type of hardware architecture in hyperspectral image processing due to its low weight and compact size, which allows for on-board data processing. In this paper, we develop an innovative GPU implementation of a standard hyperspectral image processing algorithm called pixel purity index (PPI) and utilized, among others, in commercial software tools such as ITTVIS Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) software originally developed by Analytical Imaging and Geophysics (AIG), one of the most popular tools currently available for processing remotely sensed data. The algorithm has been implemented using the compute device unified architecture (CUDA), and tested on the NVidia Tesla C1060 architecture, achieving a significant performance increase in the analysis of both synthetic and real hyperspectral data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Pixel","Indexes","Graphics processing unit","Kernel","Instruction sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","image processing","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPU implementation","pixel purity index algorithm","hyperspectral image analysis","hyperspectral imaging","spectral information","high performance computing model","remote sensing mission","graphic processing unit","hyperspectral image processing","hardware architecture","onboard data processing","innovative GPU implementation","software tools","ITTVIS environment","image visualization","compute device unified architecture","NVidia Tesla C1060 architecture","synthetic hyperspectral data","real hyperspectral data","analytical imaging and geophysics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral data","pixel purity index","graphics processing units (GPUs)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613110","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTERWKSP.2010.5613110","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference On Cluster Computing Workshops and Posters (CLUSTER WORKSHOPS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606060/5613076/05613110.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTERWKSP.2010.5613110","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613076","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference On Cluster Computing Workshops and Posters (CLUSTER WORKSHOPS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU implementation of the pixel purity index algorithm for hyperspectral image analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GPU implementation of the pixel purity index algorithm for hyperspectral image analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613110/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613110/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11623608","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU implementation of the pixel purity index algorithm for hyperspectral image analysis","confLoc":"Heraklion, Greece","sourcePdf":"hpccepaper10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063377S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606060","isNumber":"5613076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606060","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5613076","articleId":"5613110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5613128,"authors":[{"name":"Hwan Seok Chung","affiliation":["Optical Internet Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Hwan Seok Chung received the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, 2003.","In 2003, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the KAIST, where he was engaged in research on hybrid coarse wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM)/dense-WDM system for metro area network.

We show that carver-induced phase distortion causes an error in frequency offset estimation as well as sensitivity degradation. Based on the periodicity of distortion pattern, the phase distortion is compensated by estimating mean phase distortions for even and odd symbols after block phase estimation and subtracting these values from original symbols.

This data modulation technique employs a finite-state Markov chain following a four-state trellis to encode user data in the electronic domain. The encoding redistributes the SPECTS O-CDMA user data bits across four different waveforms to defeat the eavesdropper attacks on upstream links via power detectors or differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) receivers. The four-state encoder-decoder is implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) with high-speed serial transceivers. A SPECTS O-CDMA testbed with four-state encoded data modulation at up to 2.5 Gb/s/user is demonstrated and its single user link security is tested using a DPSK demodulator to emulate the eavesdropping detection. The security test verifies that this modulation technique effectively prevented interception by DPSK detection. The four-state coding can be extended to be time variable through switching among several trellis state definitions to achieve more rigorous security.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2010.2090129","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5672498/05613131.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2010.2090129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5672498","startPage":"62","endPage":"68","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Four-State Data Encoding for Enhanced Security Against Upstream Eavesdropping in SPECTS O-CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Four-State Data Encoding for Enhanced Security Against Upstream Eavesdropping in SPECTS O-CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2011","accessionNumber":"11729625","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5613131/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Four-State Data Encoding for Enhanced Security Against Upstream Eavesdropping in SPECTS O-CDMA","sourcePdf":"jlt-yang-2090129-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052029S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2011","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5672498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5672498","articleId":"5613131","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5613134,"authors":[{"name":"Steven Wright","affiliation":["Microsaic Systems Ltd., Surrey, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/5638586/5613134/5613134-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Steven Wright was born in London, U.K., in 1970.

There is increasing interest in 3-D reconstruction of objects from radar measurements. Traditional 3-D SAR image formation requires data collection over a densely sampled azimuth-elevation sector. In practice, such a dense measurement set is difficult or impossible to obtain, and effective 3-D reconstructions using sparse measurements are sought. This paper presents wide-angle 3-D image reconstruction approaches for object reconstruction that exploit reconstruction sparsity in the signal domain to ameliorate the limitations of sparse measurements. Two methods are presented; first, we use \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n penalized (for p \u2264 1) least squares inversion, and second, we utilize tomographic SAR processing to derive wide-angle 3-D reconstruction algorithms that are computationally attractive but apply to a specific class of sparse aperture samplings. All approaches rely on high-frequency radar backscatter phenomenology so that sparse signal representations align with physical radar scattering properties of the objects of interest. We present full 360\u00b0 3-D SAR visualizations of objects from air-to-ground X-band radar measurements using different flight paths to illustrate and compare the two approaches.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2090128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5767682/05613143.pdf","startPage":"408","endPage":"423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2090128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Signal Methods for 3-D Radar Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613143","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613143/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Signal Methods for 3-D Radar Imaging","volume":"5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12004763","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613143/","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Signal Methods for 3-D Radar Imaging","sourcePdf":"jstsp-austin-2090128-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098349S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5767682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"5767682","articleId":"5613143","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5613155,"authors":[{"name":"Shefeng Yan","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5762410/5613155/5613155-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shefeng Yan (M'05\u2013SM'10) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 1999, 2001, and 2005, respectively.","He was a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IACAS), Beijing, China, from 2005 to 2007, and with the Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway, from 2007 to 2009, respectively.

In this paper, an approach to real-valued time-domain implementation of the modal beamformer for broadband spherical microphone arrays is presented. The microphone array data are converted to the spherical harmonics domain by using the discrete spherical Fourier transform, and then steered to the look direction followed by the pattern generation unit implemented using the filter-and-sum structure. We derive the expression for the array response, the beamformer output power against both isotropic noise and spatially white noise, and the mainlobe spatial response variation in terms of the finite impulse response (FIR) filters' tap weights. A multiple-constraint problem is then formulated to find the filters' tap weights with the aim of providing a suitable tradeoff among multiple conflicting performance measures such as directivity index, robustness, sidelobe level, and mainlobe response variation. Simulation and experimental results show good performance of the proposed time-domain broadband modal beamforming approach.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2087754","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5762410/05613155.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5762410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2087754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","startPage":"1221","endPage":"1230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-Domain Implementation of Broadband Beamformer in Spherical Harmonics Domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"Time-Domain Implementation of Broadband Beamformer in Spherical Harmonics Domain","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613155/","volume":"19","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5613155/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"11972230","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Domain Implementation of Broadband Beamformer in Spherical Harmonics Domain","sourcePdf":"tasl-yan-2087754-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100361S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5762410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5762410","articleId":"5613155","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5613162,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/5621692/5613162/5613162-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chuan Xu (S'08) received the B.S. degree in microelectronics and the M.S. degree in microelectronics and solid-state electronics from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

The model is verified against electrostatic measurements as well as a commercial full-wave electromagnetic simulation tool and subsequently employed for various performance (delay) analyses. The compact model is also applicable to TSVs made of carbon nanotube (CNT) bundles, once a slight modification (making the effective conductivity complex) is made. Various geometries (as per the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors) and prospective materials (Cu, W, and single-walled/multiwalled CNTs) are evaluated, and a comparative performance analysis is presented. It is shown that CNT-bundle-based TSVs can offer smaller or comparable high-frequency resistance than those of other materials due to the reduced skin effect in CNT bundle structures. On the other hand, the performance (delay) analysis indicates that the performance differences among different TSV materials are rather small. However, it is shown that CNTs provide an improved heat dissipation path due to their much higher thermal conductivity. In addition, the improved mechanical robustness and thermal stability of CNTs also favor their selection as TSV materials in emerging 3-D ICs.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2010.2076382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5621692/05613162.pdf","startPage":"3405","endPage":"3417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2010.2076382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact AC Modeling and Performance Analysis of Through-Silicon Vias in 3-D ICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613162/","displayDocTitle":"Compact AC Modeling and Performance Analysis of Through-Silicon Vias in 3-D ICs","volume":"57","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11655664","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613162/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact AC Modeling and Performance Analysis of Through-Silicon Vias in 3-D ICs","sourcePdf":"ted-banerjee-2076382-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106758S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5621692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"218","xplore-issue":"5621692","articleId":"5613162","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5613178,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 M.

In traditional X8R products [Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) specification, AC/C within \u00b115% between -55\u00b0C and +150\u00b0C compared to that at 25\u00b0C], the dielectric material is designed for applications up to 150\u00b0C. However, at temperatures above 150\u00b0C, these typically suffer from degradation of reliability performance and severe reduction in capacitance, particularly under dc bias conditions. Recently, a Class-I dielectric material has been developed using nickel electrodes for high-temperature application up to 200\u00b0C. Due to its linear dielectric nature, this material exhibits highly stable capacitance as a function of temperature and voltage.

Previous measurement studies have shown that network traffic flows are often self-similar. The degree of self-similarity is described by the Hurst parameter H. In the literature, various methods have been used in estimating H, while their performances have not been evaluated for network traces that contain periodicity-based anomalies. In this paper, we investigate the performance of well-known estimators for traffic flow measurements with periodicity-based anomalies. We derive analytical expressions for widely used estimation methods in time, frequency, wavelet, and eigen domains and demonstrate through simulations that periodicity-based anomalies affect Hurst parameter estimation, causing unreliable H estimates. We show that our theoretical and experimental results are consistent with the observations of real network traffic flow measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2010.2084711","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5725255/05613183.pdf","startPage":"1358","endPage":"1366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2010.2084711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5725255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Periodicity-Based Anomalies in Self-Similar Network Traffic Flow Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613183","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613183/","displayDocTitle":"Periodicity-Based Anomalies in Self-Similar Network Traffic Flow Measurements","volume":"60","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11850862","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613183/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Periodicity-Based Anomalies in Self-Similar Network Traffic Flow Measurements","sourcePdf":"tim-oktug-2084711-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125271S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5725255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5725255","articleId":"5613183","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5613186,"authors":[{"name":"Liangjing Yang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/5666995/5613186/5613186-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liangjing Yang received the B.Eng.

We employ an OFDM signal to increase the frequency diversity of the system, as different scattering centers of a target resonate variably at different frequencies. Moreover, the multipath propagation increases the spatial diversity by providing extra \u201clooks\u201d at the target. First, we develop a parametric OFDM radar model by reformulating the target-detection problem as the task of sparse-signal spectrum estimation. At a particular range cell, we exploit the sparsity of multiple paths and the knowledge of the environment to estimate the paths along which the target responses are received. Then, to estimate the sparse vector, we employ a collection of multiple small Dantzig selectors (DS) that utilizes more prior structures of the sparse vector. We use the \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-constrained minimal singular value (\u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-CMSV) of the measurement matrix to analytically evaluate the reconstruction performance and demonstrate that our decomposed DS performs better than the standard DS. In addition, we propose a constrained MOO-based algorithm to optimally design the spectral parameters of the OFDM waveform for the next coherent processing interval by simultaneously optimizing two objective functions: minimizing the upper bound on the estimation error to improve the efficiency of sparse-recovery and maximizing the squared Mahalanobis-distance to increase the performance of the underlying detection problem. We provide a few numerical examples to illustrate the performance characteristics of the sparse recovery and demonstrate the achieved performance improvement due to adaptive OFDM waveform design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613205/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","volume":"59","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11742856","htmlLink":"/document/5613205/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization of OFDM Radar Waveform for Target Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimization of OFDM Radar Waveform for Target Detection","sourcePdf":"tsp-nehorai-2089628-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085104S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5685344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5685344","articleId":"5613205","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5613206,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjaka G.

While there are many control strategies that have been developed and presented, most are expansions of hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) control strategies and do not maximize the true potential the PHEV offers as a result of its ability to operate in electric-only mode over a significant distance. In this paper, state-of-the-art control strategies are reviewed and classified in detail. PHEV controllers mostly operate on either a rule-based or an optimization-based algorithm, each having its own advantages and disadvantages. An overview of the controllers is given, and an analysis on which strategy is more suitable to maximize PHEV performance in different drive cycle conditions is provided. Finally, a new classification for PHEV control strategies based on the operation of the vehicle is presented and verified through simulation results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613206/","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5613206/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11759889","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"Classification and Review of Control Strategies for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification and Review of Control Strategies for Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tvt-emadi-2090178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073754S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5689379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"433","xplore-issue":"5689379","articleId":"5613206","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5613207,"authors":[{"name":"Fan-Shuo Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5713041/5613207/5613207-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fan-Shuo Tseng (S'08) was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in November 1980.

Nonlinear designs in such systems, however, have yet to be investigated. In this paper, we propose nonlinear transceiver designs for a linear source and relay precoded system with the QR successive-interference-cancellation (SIC) receiver and another linear source and relay precoded system with the minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) SIC receiver. Our designs minimize the criterion of the block error rate, which is a complicated function of the source and relay precoders. Solving the two precoders simultaneously is not feasible. To overcome the difficulties, we first resort to the primal decomposition approach, i.e., transferring the original optimization to a subproblem and a master problem and solving the two precoders individually. However, since two power constraints are mutually coupled, the decomposition cannot actually be conducted. We then propose a unitary structure for the source precoder and show that the power constraints can be decoupled. As a result, the source precoder can be solved as a function of the relay precoder in the subproblem. With a proposed relay precoder structure, the master problem can further be transferred to a scalar-valued concave optimization problem. A closed-form solution can finally be derived by the Karuch-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Simulations show that the proposed transceivers can significantly outperform the existing linear transceivers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Transceiver Designs in MIMO Amplify-and-Forward Relay Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2090180","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5713041/05613207.pdf","startPage":"528","endPage":"538","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2090180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713041","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613207","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613207/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Transceiver Designs in MIMO Amplify-and-Forward Relay Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5613207/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11807389","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Transceiver Designs in MIMO Amplify-and-Forward Relay Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-tseng-2090180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17947S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5713041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5713041","articleId":"5613207","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5613228,"authors":[{"name":"Yasser Soliman","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5662237/5613228/5613228-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yasser Soliman (S'05) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Benha University, Cairo, Egypt, and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada, in 2005, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.","His current research interests include RF and millimeter-wave circuit theory and design for wireless transceivers."]},"firstName":"Yasser","lastName":"Soliman","id":"37399395700"},{"name":"Ralph Mason","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5662237/5613228/5613228-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Ralph Mason (M'91) received the M.Sc. degree from Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada, and the Ph.D. degree from Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada, both in electrical engineering.","He is an Associate Professor with Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

Therefore we explore planar patch elements which offer a simplified geometry with potentially reduced weight and cost and are suitable for conformal applications. We use a genetic algorithm to design a patch element in a unit cell of an infinite periodic array and model the feed with the usual \u03b4-gap voltage source. However, since this feed is a non-realizable mathematical concept, we also explore the antenna performance achieved with several realistic feeds. For broadside arrays we obtain a bandwidth B \u2248 4:1 both with the \u03b4-gap and with the realistic feeds. For arrays with scan angles out to 45\u00b0, the initial bandwidth B \u2248 2:1 with the \u03b4-gap is reduced to B \u2248 1.7:1 with a differential coaxial feed, whereas the initial bandwidth is maintained with a GA-optimized custom feed.

Multi-functional antennas provide advantages over aggregate antenna clusters by reducing space requirements, and can aid in the optimal placement of all required apertures to provide adequate isolation between channels. To achieve needed isolation between antenna bands when multiple radiators are in close proximity requires proper selection of antenna topology and the feed network design. This paper seeks to highlight design challenges in the implementation of an X-band (12 GHz) microstrip patch array into a superstrate layer covering printed dual-band slot loop antennas. We describe a novel feature in the proposed design wherein the high frequency array conforms to a specific topology allowed by lower frequency elements to create a single multi-band, multi-functional aperture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11623745","htmlLink":"/document/5613256/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Integration of an X-band microstrip patch array and beamformer for a multifunction antenna array","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of an X-band microstrip patch array and beamformer for a multifunction antenna array","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"158540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051175S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606061","isNumber":"5613232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606061","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5613232","articleId":"5613256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5613258,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Comparing to a standard genetic algorithm, a twice faster convergence rate and ultimate stability in hitting the global extrema is demonstrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613268/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11623757","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613268/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient approach for fast synthesis of phased arrays with the aid of a hybrid genetic algorithm and a smart feed representation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient approach for fast synthesis of phased arrays with the aid of a hybrid genetic algorithm and a smart feed representation","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"144391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077482S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606061","isNumber":"5613232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606061","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5613232","articleId":"5613268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5613269,"authors":[{"name":"Omar Bakr","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Bakr","id":"37277504300"},{"name":"Mark Johnson","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Johnson","id":"37277459300"},{"name":"Jungdong Park","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jungdong","lastName":"Park","id":"37600559200"},{"name":"Ehsan Adabi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ehsan","lastName":"Adabi","id":"37296242200"},{"name":"Kevin Jones","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Jones","id":"37592056600"},{"name":"Ali Niknejad","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Niknejad","id":"37280807800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5613269","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":600},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Radio frequency","Gain","Adaptive arrays","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","adaptive filters","array signal processing","vector quantisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamforming antenna arrays","3-dimensional antenna structures","hybrid RF/digital radio architectures","adaptive filtering","vector quantization","interference cancellation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613269","doi":"10.1109/ARRAY.2010.5613269","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","abstract":"Many state-of-the-art wireless systems, such as long distance mesh networks and high bandwidth networks using mm-wave frequencies, require high gain antennas to overcome adverse channel conditions. These networks could be greatly aided by adaptive beamforming antenna arrays, which can significantly simplify the installation and maintenance costs (e.g., by enabling automatic beam alignment). However, building large, low cost beamforming arrays is very complicated. In this paper, we examine the main challenges presented by large arrays, starting from electromagnetic and antenna design and proceeding to the signal processing and algorithms domain. We propose 3-dimensional antenna structures and hybrid RF/digital radio architectures that can significantly reduce the complexity and improve the power efficiency of adaptive array systems. We also present signal processing techniques based on adaptive filtering methods that enhance the robustness of these architectures. Finally, we present computationally efficient vector quantization techniques that significantly improve the interference cancellation capabilities of analog beamforming architectures.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARRAY.2010.5613269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613232","startPage":"806","endPage":"813","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606061/5613232/05613269.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scalable-low cost architecture for high gain beamforming antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5613269/","displayDocTitle":"A scalable-low cost architecture for high gain beamforming antennas","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11623758","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scalable-low cost architecture for high gain beamforming antennas","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"140551.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06504S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606061","isNumber":"5613232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606061","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5613232","articleId":"5613269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5613276,"authors":[{"name":"St\u00e9phane Kemkemian","affiliation":["THALES Airborne Systems, France"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phane","lastName":"Kemkemian","id":"37300780400"},{"name":"Myriam Nouvel-Fiani","affiliation":["THALES Airborne Systems, France"],"firstName":"Myriam","lastName":"Nouvel-Fiani","id":"38275409900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5613276","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":10,"totalDownloads":704},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar antennas","Receivers","Radar detection","Couplings","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active antenna arrays","electronic warfare","military radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["common radar","EW multifunction active arrays","military air platforms","fire control radars","surveillance radars","electronic warfare systems","radio links","multifunction AESA antenna sharing","multifunctions sensor","ad-hoc communication functions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613276","abstract":"Military Air platforms are fitted with Fire Control or Surveillance Radars, usually operating in X-band, Electronic Warfare Systems (EWS), and some radio links. Each of these systems is dedicated to a particular task and the cooperation is reduced to a minimal exchange of information between them mainly for avoiding mutual disturbances. Major system performance enhancements are to be expected thanks to close co-operations of one sensor to each others and thanks to the sharing of resources, especially in the field of multifunction AESA antenna sharing. The future co-operations can be ordered in four levels. The levels one to three lead progressively to a multi-functions sensor. The last one is the deployment, on a single or multiple platforms, of compact multi-functions sensors on a network basis. Another area of co-operation is the realization of R.F. functions such as \u201cad-hoc\u201d communication functions using the Radar or the EWS multifunction R.F. and antennas.","doi":"10.1109/ARRAY.2010.5613276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARRAY.2010.5613276","startPage":"777","endPage":"784","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606061/5613232/05613276.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward common radar & EW multifunction active arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Toward common radar & EW multifunction active arrays","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613276/","accessionNumber":"11623765","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613276/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward common radar & EW multifunction active arrays","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"135440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04033S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606061","isNumber":"5613232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606061","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5613232","articleId":"5613276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5613277,"authors":[{"name":"O.

SSDBF enables low-cost/low-profile/low-power digital beam forming phased arrays that scales in frequency (L through Ka and higher), bandwidth (100's MHz) and subarray size (100's elements per subarray) with a single down-converter, single digital receiver and single Nyquist-rate ADC for the entire subarray. It achieves this by replacing the MMIC T/R module at each element with much simpler bi-phase re-modulating hardware, and by re-modulating and aggregating the return signal incident at each element such that it can perfectly recover the complex baseband-equivalent of the RF signal of each element without mutual interference and with negligible noise performance degradation. The bi-phase re-modulator at each element can be extremely small and low power and amenable to implementations as simple as a single RF switch mounted directly at the antenna element with associated ON/OFF switch control logic built on the back. Thus SSDBF truly enables flat, thin, lightweight conformal phased arrays and has the potential of reducing phased array costs by, possibly, multiple orders of magnitude relative to CDBF state-of-the-art. The SSDBF parameters and waveforms are flexible, programmable and can be tailored and adapted, practically, to support any radar or communications applications. In a project for DARPA, Applied Radar is developing an X-band SSDBF-based radar prototype in which the SSDBF features and performance have been demonstrated. In this paper, we describe the SSDBF method for a radar application including simulation, indoor testbed and open-range test results.","doi":"10.1109/ARRAY.2010.5613293","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606061/5613232/05613293.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARRAY.2010.5613293","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","startPage":"665","endPage":"672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spread Spectrum Digital Beamforming (SSDBF) radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Spread Spectrum Digital Beamforming (SSDBF) radar","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613293/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613293/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11623668","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spread Spectrum Digital Beamforming (SSDBF) radar","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"114571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043859S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606061","isNumber":"5613232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606061","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5613232","articleId":"5613293","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5613295,"authors":[{"name":"Deukhyoun Heo","affiliation":["Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Deukhyoun","lastName":"Heo","id":"37278448100"},{"name":"Karl F.

Up to now they carry payloads (surveillance, combat) for military purposes in crisis or war time. For training, UAV are flown in special areas attributed in a limited space and a limited time slot. In the future, UAV will also be used for civilian tasks. For these reasons, UAV will have to be inserted in the general Air traffic and \u201cSense and Avoid\u201d systems will be mandatory. Among the possible sensors, the radar is the most pertinent one: it is \u201call-weather\u201d and provides accurate range, direction and closing speed. In this paper, a low cost solution based on the coherent \u201cMIMO\u201d principles is described. This solution allows the location of the radar within the UAV airframe without any moving parts, hence provides a high reliability level. The rationale of the proposed architecture is explained, then the enabling technologies and related waveforms are described.","doi":"10.1109/ARRAY.2010.5613309","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606061/5613232/05613309.pdf","startPage":"573","endPage":"580","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARRAY.2010.5613309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO radar for sense and avoid for UAV","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613309/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO radar for sense and avoid for UAV","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11623684","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613309/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO radar for sense and avoid for UAV","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"094441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070869S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606061","isNumber":"5613232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606061","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5613232","articleId":"5613309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5613310,"authors":[{"name":"Yanyan Liu","affiliation":["Agiltron Corporation, Woburn, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yanyan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598265400"},{"name":"Geoffrey Burnham","affiliation":["Agiltron Corporation, Woburn, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Burnham","id":"37603159700"},{"name":"Guanghai Jin","affiliation":["Agiltron Corporation, Woburn, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Guanghai","lastName":"Jin","id":"37594303500"},{"name":"Jing Zhao","affiliation":["Agiltron Corporation, Woburn, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37598319300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5613310","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":298},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser beams","Delay","Radio frequency","Optical fibers","Delay effects","Fiber gratings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","beam steering","demultiplexing","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband multibeam photonics","multibeam RF beamformer","phased array antenna systems","fiber optic WDM-mux-demux techniques","photonic true-time delay techniques","RF beamforming breadboard","beam steering"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband multi-beam photonics-based RF beamformer","doi":"10.1109/ARRAY.2010.5613310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613232","endPage":"585","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606061/5613232/05613310.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARRAY.2010.5613310","startPage":"581","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613310","abstract":"This paper presents a photonics based multi-beam RF beamformer for phased array antenna systems.

This radar system beamforms in the near field, where the target scene of interest is located 3-70 m down range. It utilizes digital beamforming, computed using the range migration synthetic aperture radar (SAR) algorithm. The phased array antenna is fed by transmit and receive fan-out switch matrices that are connected to a UWB LFM pulse compressed radar operating in stretch mode. The peak transmit power is 1 mW and the transmitted LFM pulses are long in time duration (2.5-10 ms), requiring the radar to transmit and receive simultaneously. It will be shown through simulation and measurement that the bi-static antenna pairs are nearly equivalent to 44 elements spaced \u03bb/2 across a linear array. This result is due to the fact that the phase center position errors relative to a uniform \u03bb/2 element spacing are negligible. This radar is capable of imaging free-space target scenes made up of objects as small as 15.24 cm tall rods and 3.2 cm tall metal nails at a 0.5 Hz rate. Applications for this radar system include short-range near-real-time imaging of unknown targets through a lossy dielectric slab and radar cross section (RCS) measurements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ultrawideband (UWB) switched-antenna-array radar imaging system","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","doi":"10.1109/ARRAY.2010.5613313","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606061/5613232/05613313.pdf","startPage":"543","endPage":"550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARRAY.2010.5613313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613232","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613313","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An ultrawideband (UWB) switched-antenna-array radar imaging system","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613313/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11623688","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ultrawideband (UWB) switched-antenna-array radar imaging system","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"090364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056634S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606061","isNumber":"5613232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606061","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5613232","articleId":"5613313","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5613314,"authors":[{"name":"Tyler S.

The RTPS consists of a differential, vertically-coupled, coupled-line hybrid and variable, parallel-LC, resonant, reflective loads, both of which enable low-loss millimeter-wave operation. The design considerations for a silicon-based implementation of all the beamformer elements are discussed in detail. In particular, the influence of the different RTPS components on its insertion loss is analyzed. The beamformer IC and a breakout of the RTPS are implemented using CMOS-only features of IBM's 8HP 0.13 \u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS process, and employ areas of 2.1mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and 0.33mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, respectively, without probe pads. Differential s-parameter measurements at 60GHz show a phase-shift range greater than 150\u00b0, insertion losses of 4-6.2dB in the RTPS and 14-16dB in the beamformer, and an isolation better than 35dB between adjacent beamformer channels.

beamforming using highly integrated receiver-on-chip modules","abstract":"This paper describes the demonstration of a four-channel digital beamforming system incorporating highly integrated silicon germanium downconverter modules. The downconverter modules are designed to translate X-band frequencies (9 to 10.5 GHz) down to a common 1.0 GHz IF output. The modules were integrated with an X-band antenna array and high-speed digitizer system to form a rudimentary digital beamforming subsystem. Data was collected in a compact antenna range and compared to simulated antenna patterns. Basic calibration and beamforming methods were applied to showcase the ability to include new, highly integrated components into digital beamforming subsystem demonstrations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613369/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11623634","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613369/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Digital beamforming using highly integrated receiver-on-chip modules","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital beamforming using highly integrated receiver-on-chip modules","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"032563.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097316S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606061","isNumber":"5613232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606061","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5613232","articleId":"5613369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5613391,"authors":[{"name":"William Chappell","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Chappell","id":"37280991000"},{"name":"Caleb Fulton","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Caleb","lastName":"Fulton","id":"37544818100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5127-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5128-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5613391","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1483},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Array signal processing","Gallium nitride","Radio frequency","Field programmable gate arrays","Antennas","Calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","array signal processing","microwave antenna arrays","phased array radar","transceivers","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["army digital array radar panel development","wide-bandgap semiconductor technology","phased array radar","S-band subarray systems","plastic-packaged gallium-nitride amplifiers","multichannel transceiver IC","beamforming","DAR subarray"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613391","doi":"10.1109/ARRAY.2010.5613391","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Symposium on Phased Array Systems and Technology","abstract":"The Army Digital Array Radar (DAR) project's goal is to demonstrate how wide-bandgap semiconductor technology, highly-integrated transceivers, and the ever-increasing capabilities of commercial digital components can be leveraged to provide new capabilities and enhanced performance in future low-cost phased array systems.

We conducted an exploratory laboratory study in which information visualization novices explored fictitious sales data by communicating visualization specifications to a human mediator, who rapidly constructed the visualizations using commercial visualization software. We found that three activities were central to the iterative visualization construction process: data attribute selection, visual template selection, and visual mapping specification. The major barriers faced by the participants were translating questions into data attributes, designing visual mappings, and interpreting the visualizations. Partial specification was common, and the participants used simple heuristics and preferred visualizations they were already familiar with, such as bar, line and pie charts. We derived abstract models from our observations that describe barriers in the data exploration process and uncovered how information visualization novices think about visualization specifications. Our findings support the need for tools that suggest potential visualizations and support iterative refinement, that provide explanations and help with learning, and that are tightly integrated into tool support for the overall visual analytics process.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How Information Visualization Novices Construct Visualizations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.164","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5613414/05613431.pdf","startPage":"943","endPage":"952","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613414","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613431/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"How Information Visualization Novices Construct Visualizations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5613431/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11615877","pubMedId":"20975131","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How Information Visualization Novices Construct Visualizations","sourcePdf":"ttg2010060943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078706S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5613414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5613414","articleId":"5613431","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5613437,"authors":[{"name":"Zhicheng Liu","affiliation":["School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Zhicheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37592993600"},{"name":"John Stasko","affiliation":["School of Interactive Computing and the GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Stasko","id":"37267736900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5613437","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":96,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4070},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613437","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive science","Cognition","Visualization","Data visualization","Computational modeling","Brain modeling","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognition","data visualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mental model","visual reasoning","information visualization","InfoVis","human cognitive activity","external anchoring","information foraging","cognitive offloading"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mental model","model-based reasoning","distributed cognition","interaction","theory","information visualization"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Cognition","Computer Graphics","Humans","Models, Psychological","Visual Perception"]}],"abstract":"Although previous research has suggested that examining the interplay between internal and external representations can benefit our understanding of the role of information visualization (InfoVis) in human cognitive activities, there has been little work detailing the nature of internal representations, the relationship between internal and external representations and how interaction is related to these representations. In this paper, we identify and illustrate a specific kind of internal representation, mental models, and outline the high-level relationships between mental models and external visualizations. We present a top-down perspective of reasoning as model construction and simulation, and discuss the role of visualization in model based reasoning. From this perspective, interaction can be understood as active modeling for three primary purposes: external anchoring, information foraging, and cognitive offloading. Finally we discuss the implications of our approach for design, evaluation and theory development.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.177","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5613414/05613437.pdf","startPage":"999","endPage":"1008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mental Models, Visual Reasoning and Interaction in Information Visualization: A Top-down Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613437/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Mental Models, Visual Reasoning and Interaction in Information Visualization: A Top-down Perspective","volume":"16","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11615881","pubMedId":"20975137","htmlLink":"/document/5613437/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mental Models, Visual Reasoning and Interaction in Information Visualization: A Top-down Perspective","sourcePdf":"ttg2010060999.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132118S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5613414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"5613414","articleId":"5613437","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5613439,"authors":[{"name":"Aritra Dasgupta","affiliation":["UNC-Charlotte, USA"],"firstName":"Aritra","lastName":"Dasgupta","id":"37593202500"},{"name":"Robert Kosara","affiliation":["UNC-Charlotte, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Kosara","id":"37282563400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5613439","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":81,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":919},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Data visualization","Histograms","Clutter","Optimization","Visualization","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","data visualisation","interactive programming","matrix algebra","parallel programming","program diagnostics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pargnostics","screen-space metrics","interactive visualization","screen space","parallel coordinates diagnostics","matrix display","NP-complete problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Parallel Coordinates","metrics","display optimization","visualization models."]}],"abstract":"Interactive visualization requires the translation of data into a screen space of limited resolution. While currently ignored by most visualization models, this translation entails a loss of information and the introduction of a number of artifacts that can be useful, (e.g., aggregation, structures) or distracting (e.g., over-plotting, clutter) for the analysis. This phenomenon is observed in parallel coordinates, where overlapping lines between adjacent axes form distinct patterns, representing the relation between variables they connect. However, even for a small number of dimensions, the challenge is to effectively convey the relationships for all combinations of dimensions. The size of the dataset and a large number of dimensions only add to the complexity of this problem. To address these issues, we propose Pargnostics, parallel coordinates diagnostics, a model based on screen-space metrics that quantify the different visual structures. Pargnostics metrics are calculated for pairs of axes and take into account the resolution of the display as well as potential axis inversions. Metrics include the number of line crossings, crossing angles, convergence, overplotting, etc. To construct a visualization view, the user can pick from a ranked display showing pairs of coordinate axes and the structures between them, or examine all possible combinations of axes at once in a matrix display. Picking the best axes layout is an NP-complete problem in general, but we provide a way of automatically optimizing the display according to the user's preferences based on our metrics and model.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5613414/05613439.pdf","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pargnostics: Screen-Space Metrics for Parallel Coordinates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613439/","displayDocTitle":"Pargnostics: Screen-Space Metrics for Parallel Coordinates","volume":"16","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11615884","pubMedId":"20975139","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613439/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pargnostics: Screen-Space Metrics for Parallel Coordinates","sourcePdf":"ttg2010061017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066857S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5613414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5613414","articleId":"5613439","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5613449,"authors":[{"name":"Yingcai Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yingcai","lastName":"Wu","id":"37407308300"},{"name":"Furu Wei","affiliation":["IBM China Research Laboratory, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Furu","lastName":"Wei","id":"37396839900"},{"name":"Shixia Liu","affiliation":["IBM China Research Laboratory, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shixia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406039100"},{"name":"Norman Au","affiliation":["School of Hotel & Tourism Management, Hong Kong PolyTechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Norman","lastName":"Au","id":"37590967500"},{"name":"Weiwei Cui","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Weiwei","lastName":"Cui","id":"37391623900"},{"name":"Hong Zhou","affiliation":["Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37405368200"},{"name":"Huamin Qu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Huamin","lastName":"Qu","id":"37272637300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5613449","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2682},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Visualization","Uncertainty","Feature extraction","Data mining","Wheels","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","data visualisation","feedback","hotel industry","interactive systems","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OpinionSeer","interactive visualization system","hotel customer feedback","Web technology","hotel services","visual analysis","online customer opinions","visualization-centric opinion mining technique","scatterplots","radial visualization","subjective logic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["opinion visualization","radial visualization","uncertainty visualization"]}],"abstract":"The rapid development of Web technology has resulted in an increasing number of hotel customers sharing their opinions on the hotel services. Effective visual analysis of online customer opinions is needed, as it has a significant impact on building a successful business. In this paper, we present OpinionSeer, an interactive visualization system that could visually analyze a large collection of online hotel customer reviews. The system is built on a new visualization-centric opinion mining technique that considers uncertainty for faithfully modeling and analyzing customer opinions. A new visual representation is developed to convey customer opinions by augmenting well-established scatterplots and radial visualization. To provide multiple-level exploration, we introduce subjective logic to handle and organize subjective opinions with degrees of uncertainty. Several case studies illustrate the effectiveness and usefulness of OpinionSeer on analyzing relationships among multiple data dimensions and comparing opinions of different groups. Aside from data on hotel customer feedback, OpinionSeer could also be applied to visually analyze customer opinions on other products or services.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.183","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5613414/05613449.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613414","startPage":"1109","endPage":"1118","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OpinionSeer: Interactive Visualization of Hotel Customer Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OpinionSeer: Interactive Visualization of Hotel Customer Feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613449/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11615894","pubMedId":"20975149","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5613449/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OpinionSeer: Interactive Visualization of Hotel Customer Feedback","sourcePdf":"ttg2010061109.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062329S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5613414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"5613414","articleId":"5613449","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5613451,"authors":[{"name":"Marian D\u00f6rk","affiliation":["University of Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Marian","lastName":"D\u00f6rk","id":"37590950400"},{"name":"Daniel Gruen","affiliation":["IBM Research Division, IBM Thomas J.

Microblogging communities, such as Twitter, are increasingly used as digital backchannels for timely exchange of brief comments and impressions during political speeches, sport competitions, natural disasters, and other large events. Currently, shared updates are typically displayed in the form of a simple list, making it difficult to get an overview of the fast-paced discussions as it happens in the moment and how it evolves over time. In contrast, our Visual Backchannel design provides an evolving, interactive, and multi-faceted visual overview of large-scale ongoing conversations on Twitter. To visualize a continuously updating information stream, we include visual saliency for what is happening now and what has just happened, set in the context of the evolving conversation. As part of a fully web-based coordinated-view system we introduce Topic Streams, a temporally adjustable stacked graph visualizing topics over time, a People Spiral representing participants and their activity, and an Image Cloud encoding the popularity of event photos by size. Together with a post listing, these mutually linked views support cross-filtering along topics, participants, and time ranges. We discuss our design considerations, in particular with respect to evolving visualizations of dynamically changing data. Initial feedback indicates significant interest and suggests several unanticipated uses.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613451/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613451/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11615896","pubMedId":"20975151","volume":"16","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Visual Backchannel for Large-Scale Events","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Visual Backchannel for Large-Scale Events","sourcePdf":"ttg2010061129.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093887S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5613414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"5613414","articleId":"5613451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5613452,"authors":[{"name":"Edward Segel","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Edward","lastName":"Segel","id":"37590964100"},{"name":"Jeffrey Heer","affiliation":["University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Heer","id":"37550791300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5613452","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":357,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":15669},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613452","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Visualization","Media","Image color analysis","Engineering profession","Economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","educational aids","humanities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrative visualization","telling story","data visualization","data story","online journalists","visualization research","design differences","journalistic storytelling","educational media"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Narrative visualization","storytelling","design methods","case study","journalism","social data analysis"]}],"abstract":"Data visualization is regularly promoted for its ability to reveal stories within data, yet these \u201cdata stories\u201d differ in important ways from traditional forms of storytelling. Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5613414/05613452.pdf","startPage":"1139","endPage":"1148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data","volume":"16","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613452/","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11615893","pubMedId":"20975152","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613452/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrative Visualization: Telling Stories with Data","sourcePdf":"ttg2010061139.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108032S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5613414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"357","xplore-issue":"5613414","articleId":"5613452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":5613453,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey Heer","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Heer","id":"37550791300"},{"name":"Michael Bostock","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Bostock","id":"37591067400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5613453","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1107},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613453","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Rendering (computer graphics)","Optimization","Visualization","Java","Animation","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","interactive programming","Java","object-oriented programming","rendering (computer graphics)","specification languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["declarative language design","interactive visualization","declarative domain-specific language","unobtrusive optimization","Protovis specification language","statically-typed programming language","object-oriented language","Java","animated transition","event handling","runtime compilation","visualization specification","parallelized execution","hardware-accelerated rendering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["information visualization","user interfaces","toolkits","domain specific languages","declarative languages","optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5613414/05613453.pdf","startPage":"1149","endPage":"1156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Declarative Language Design for Interactive Visualization","abstract":"We investigate the design of declarative, domain-specific languages for constructing interactive visualizations.

We demonstrate how to support rich visualizations without requiring a toolkit-specific data model and extend Protovis to enable declarative specification of animated transitions. To support cross-platform deployment, we introduce rendering and event-handling infrastructures decoupled from the runtime platform, letting designers retarget visualization specifications (e.g., from desktop to mobile phone) with reduced effort. We also explore optimizations such as runtime compilation of visualization specifications, parallelized execution, and hardware-accelerated rendering. We present benchmark studies measuring the performance gains provided by these optimizations and compare performance to existing Java-based visualization tools, demonstrating scalability improvements exceeding an order of magnitude.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613453/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613453/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11615898","pubMedId":"20975153","volume":"16","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Declarative Language Design for Interactive Visualization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Declarative Language Design for Interactive Visualization","sourcePdf":"ttg2010061149.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07242S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5613414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5613414","articleId":"5613453","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5613458,"authors":[{"name":"Kyle Koh","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyle","lastName":"Koh","id":"37587908000"},{"name":"Bongshin Lee","affiliation":["Microsoft Research Limited, USA"],"firstName":"Bongshin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293389400"},{"name":"Bohyoung Kim","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bohyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37594632900"},{"name":"Jinwook Seo","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinwook","lastName":"Seo","id":"37422552700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5613458","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":1018},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Tag clouds","Visualization","Color","Instruction sets","Spirals","Usability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ManiWordle","flexible control","wordle","multifarious tag-clouding techniques","aesthetic layout","participatory culture","Wordle-based visualization tool","custom manipulations","typography","design rationale","interaction techniques","layout tweaking","user satisfaction","art work"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interaction design","direct manipulation","flexibilty-usability tradeoff","tag-cloud","participatory visualization","user study."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613458","abstract":"Among the multifarious tag-clouding techniques, Wordle stands out to the community by providing an aesthetic layout, eliciting the emergence of the participatory culture and usage of tag-clouding in the artistic creations.

Our study provides compelling evidence that information theory can explain a significant number of phenomena or events in visualization, while no example has been found which is fundamentally in conflict with information theory. We also notice that the emphasis of some traditional applications of information theory, such as data compression or data communication, may not always suit visualization, as the former typically focuses on the efficient throughput of a communication channel, whilst the latter focuses on the effectiveness in aiding the perceptual and cognitive process for data understanding and knowledge discovery. These findings suggest that further theoretic developments are necessary for adopting and adapting information theory for visualization.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.132","startPage":"1206","endPage":"1215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613414","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5613414/05613460.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Information-theoretic Framework for Visualization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613460/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Information-theoretic Framework for Visualization","volume":"16","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5613460/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11615900","pubMedId":"20975160","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Information-theoretic Framework for Visualization","sourcePdf":"ttg2010061206.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090151S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5613414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"5613414","articleId":"5613460","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5613468,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando V.

When data are endowed with Cartesian coordinates, an extra computational effort is necessary to compute the needed distances, making multidimensional projection prohibitive in applications dealing with interactivity and massive data. The novel multidimensional projection technique proposed in this work, called Part-Linear Multidimensional Projection (PLMP), has been tailored to handle multivariate data represented in Cartesian high-dimensional spaces, requiring only distance information between pairs of representative samples. This characteristic renders PLMP faster than previous methods when processing large data sets while still being competitive in terms of precision. Moreover, knowing the range of variation for data instances in the high-dimensional space, we can make PLMP a truly streaming data projection technique, a trait absent in previous methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Phase Mapping for Projecting Massive Data Sets","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.207","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5613414/05613468.pdf","startPage":"1281","endPage":"1290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.207","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613414","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613468","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613468/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Two-Phase Mapping for Projecting Massive Data Sets","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5613468/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11615908","pubMedId":"20975168","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Phase Mapping for Projecting Massive Data Sets","sourcePdf":"ttg2010061281.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124266S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5613414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5613414","articleId":"5613468","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5613494,"authors":[{"name":"Byeonghun Lee","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byeonghun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37600709600"},{"name":"Jihye Yun","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jihye","lastName":"Yun","id":"37599808200"},{"name":"Jinwook Seo","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jinwook","lastName":"Seo","id":"37422552700"},{"name":"Byonghyo Shim","affiliation":["Korea University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byonghyo","lastName":"Shim","id":"37089094258"},{"name":"Yeong-Gil Shin","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yeong-Gil","lastName":"Shin","id":"37366743500"},{"name":"Bohyoung Kim","affiliation":["Seoul National University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bohyoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37594632900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"5613494","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":760},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"abstract":"Volume ray-casting with a higher order reconstruction filter and/or a higher sampling rate has been adopted in direct volume rendering frameworks to provide a smooth reconstruction of the volume scalar and/or to reduce artifacts when the combined frequency of the volume and transfer function is high. While it enables high-quality volume rendering, it cannot support interactive rendering due to its high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a fast high-quality volume ray-casting algorithm which effectively increases the sampling rate. While a ray traverses the volume, intensity values are uniformly reconstructed using a high-order convolution filter. Additional samplings, referred to as virtual samplings, are carried out within a ray segment from a cubic spline curve interpolating those uniformly reconstructed intensities. These virtual samplings are performed by evaluating the polynomial function of the cubic spline curve via simple arithmetic operations. The min max blocks are refined accordingly for accurate empty space skipping in the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm, also exploiting fast cubic texture filtering supported by programmable GPUs, offers renderings as good as a conventional ray-casting algorithm using high-order reconstruction filtering at the same sampling rate, while delivering 2.5x to 3.3x rendering speed-up.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rendering (computer graphics)","Spline","Transfer functions","Image reconstruction","Interpolation","Filtering","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","rendering (computer graphics)","splines (mathematics)","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast high-quality volume ray casting algorithm","virtual samplings","higher order reconstruction filter","direct volume rendering frameworks","volume scalar smooth reconstruction","transfer function","interactive rendering","high-order convolution filter","polynomial function","cubic spline curve","cubic texture filtering","programmable GPU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["direct volume rendering","GPU","high quality","curve interpolation."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","Carps","Computer Graphics","Computer Simulation","Head","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Models, Anatomic","User-Computer Interface"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2010.155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2945/5613414/05613494.pdf","startPage":"1525","endPage":"1532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2010.155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast High-Quality Volume Ray Casting with Virtual Samplings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast High-Quality Volume Ray Casting with Virtual Samplings","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613494/","volume":"16","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613494/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11622884","pubMedId":"20975194","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast High-Quality Volume Ray Casting with Virtual Samplings","sourcePdf":"ttg2010061525.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058732S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5613414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5613414","articleId":"5613494","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5613502,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Schultz","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Computation Institute, University of Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Schultz","id":"37606352800"},{"name":"Gordon L.

The utility of displaying tensor field samples has driven the development of visualization techniques that encode the tensor shape and orientation into the geometry of a tensor glyph. With some exceptions, these methods work only for positive-definite tensors (i.e. having positive eigenvalues, such as diffusion tensors). We expand the scope of tensor glyphs to all symmetric second-order tensors in two and three dimensions, gracefully and unambiguously depicting any combination of positive and negative eigenvalues. We generalize a previous method of superquadric glyphs for positive-definite tensors by drawing upon a larger portion of the superquadric shape space, supplemented with a coloring that indicates the tensor's quadratic form. We show that encoding arbitrary eigenvalue sign combinations requires design choices that differ fundamentally from those in previous work on traceless tensors (arising in the study of liquid crystals). Our method starts with a design of 2-D tensor glyphs guided by principles of symmetry and continuity, and creates 3-D glyphs that include the 2-D glyphs in their axis-aligned cross-sections. A key ingredient of our method is a novel way of mapping from the shape space of three-dimensional symmetric second-order tensors to the unit square. We apply our new glyphs to stress tensors from mechanics, geometry tensors and Hessians from image analysis, and rate-of-deformation tensors in computational fluid dynamics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613502/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","volume":"16","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"11622892","pubMedId":"20975202","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613502/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Superquadric Glyphs for Symmetric Second-Order Tensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superquadric Glyphs for Symmetric Second-Order Tensors","sourcePdf":"ttg2010061595.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178895S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"5613414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5613414","articleId":"5613502","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5613544,"authors":[{"name":"Ben Wenger","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Wenger","id":"37085943148"},{"name":"Shreekanth Mandayam","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Shreekanth","lastName":"Mandayam","id":"37271866700"},{"name":"Patrick J.

The development of sensor data analysis techniques to assist a ship's crew in monitoring machinery and summon required ship-to-shore assistance is of considerable benefit to the Navy. In addition, the Navy has a large interest in the development of distance support technology in its ongoing efforts to reduce manning on ships. In this paper, we present algorithms for the detection of anomalous events that can be identified from the analysis of monochromatic stationary ship surveillance video streams. The specific anomalies that we have focused on are the presence and growth of smoke and fire events inside the frames of the video stream. The algorithm consists of the following steps. First, a foreground segmentation algorithm based on adaptive Gaussian mixture models is employed to detect the presence of motion in a scene. The algorithm is adapted to emphasize gray-level characteristics related to smoke and fire events in the frame. Next, shape discriminant features in the foreground are enhanced using morphological operations. Following this step, the anomalous indication is tracked between frames using Kalman filtering. Finally, gray level shape and motion features corresponding to the anomaly are subjected to principal component analysis and classified using a multilayer perceptron neural network. The algorithm is exercised on 68 video streams that include the presence of anomalous events (such as fire and smoke) and benign/nuisance events (such as humans walking the field of view). Initial results show that the algorithm is successful in detecting anomalies in video streams, and is suitable for application in shipboard environments. One of the principal advantages of this technique is that the method can be applied to monitor legacy shipboard systems and environments where high-quality, color video may not be available.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE AUTOTESTCON","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605054/5613538/05613544.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE AUTOTESTCON","doi":"10.1109/AUTEST.2010.5613544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AUTEST.2010.5613544","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613538","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of anomalous events in shipboard video using moving object segmentation and tracking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fires","Pixel","Streaming media","Image segmentation","Motion segmentation","Algorithm design and analysis","Surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian processes","image segmentation","military computing","multilayer perceptrons","naval engineering","object detection","principal component analysis","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomalous event detection","shipboard video","moving object segmentation","moving object tracking","US Navy vessels","sensor data analysis techniques","ship-to-shore assistance","distance support technology","monochromatic stationary ship surveillance","foreground segmentation algorithm","adaptive Gaussian mixture models","Kalman filtering","gray level shape feature","motion feature","principal component analysis","multilayer perceptron neural network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["shipboard","navy","surveillance video","video analysis","fire detection","smoke detection","anomaly","tracking","neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Detection of anomalous events in shipboard video using moving object segmentation and tracking","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613544/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11625060","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of anomalous events in shipboard video using moving object segmentation and tracking","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"1569331629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098851S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605054","isNumber":"5613538","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605054","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5613538","articleId":"5613544","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5613619,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Verret","affiliation":["National Instruments, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Verret","id":"37591169300"},{"name":"Sean Thompson","affiliation":["National Instruments, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"Thompson","id":"37597804400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7961-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7960-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7959-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4550"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1088-7725"},{"format":"CD","value":"1088-7725"}],"articleNumber":"5613619","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Nickel","Protocols","Hardware","Physical layer","Performance evaluation","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic testing","field programmable gate arrays","firmware","hardware description languages","logic design","virtual instrumentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["custom FPGA-based test","COTS hardware","application-specific protocol","application-specific interfaces","test coverage","HDL-based FPGA programming","specialized development knowledge","National Instruments","analog I/O","digital I/O","high performance FPGA modules","NI LabVIEW graphical programming language","PXI platform","COTS components"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","COTS","test","protocol","FlexRIO","LabVIEW","modular","PXI","PXI Express","bit error","radio","SDLC","spectrum analyzer"]}],"abstract":"Of all types of test applications, none require higher reliability, greater customization, more application-specific protocols and interfaces, and higher performance for more complete test coverage than military and aerospace test systems.

The pilot signal is multiplied by an appropriate gain such that its intensity is equal to that of the crosstalk noise and is then subtracted from the desired user signals in order to eliminate the accumulated beat noise completely. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme eliminates the in-band crosstalk beat noise and achieves a larger eye diagram than codecs with no crosstalk reduction capability.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563700/5670333/05613632.pdf","startPage":"975","endPage":"983","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.2.000975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.2.000975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5670333","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of Linear Crosstalk Over Waveguide-Grating-Based Optical CDMA Coders/Decoders","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crosstalk","Codecs","Noise","Decoding","Wavelength division multiplexing","Photoconductivity","Optimized production technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arrayed waveguide gratings","code division multiple access","codecs","diffraction gratings","optical communication equipment","optical crosstalk","optical fibre networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VOL","waveguide grating","optical CDMA coder-decoder","optical code-division multiple-access","codec","crosstalk reduction","transmitter-receiver codec","cascaded dual arrayed-waveguide gratings","crosstalk noise","AWG"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical code-division multiple-access (OCDMA)","Coder\u2013decoder (codec)","Arrayed-waveguide grating (AWG)","Crosstalk beat noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Linear Crosstalk Over Waveguide-Grating-Based Optical CDMA Coders/Decoders","volume":"2","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5613632/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2010","accessionNumber":"11698263","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Linear Crosstalk Over Waveguide-Grating-Based Optical CDMA Coders/Decoders","sourcePdf":"975.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066755S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"5670333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5670333","articleId":"5613632","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5613633,"authors":[{"name":"Ngoc Dang","affiliation":["Computer Communications Laboratory, University of Aizu, Fukushima, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4563700/5670333/5613633/5613633-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ngoc T.

For the multicode demodulator, we employ a maximum-likelihood detection and optical hard limiters. The work in this paper theoretically analyzes the performance of the proposed system over linear dispersive channels, while taking into account the impacts of multiple-access interference (MAI), optical-beating interference (OBI), and receiver noise. It is seen that the use of MCM can significantly relax the effects of chromatic dispersion. In addition, MAI and OBI can be effectively mitigated in the proposed system. As a result, in comparison with the conventional systems using on-off keying (OOK) modulation and pulse-position modulation (PPM), the proposed system can support a higher user bit rate and a larger number of users. Also, a lower transmitted power is required and a longer transmission length can be achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563700/5670333/05613633.pdf","startPage":"967","endPage":"974","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.2.000967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.2.000967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5670333","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing the Dispersion Effects in Multiwavelength Optical CDMA Systems by Using MCM Signaling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical pulses","Decoding","Dispersion","Optical receivers","Bit error rate","Optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","channel estimation","code division multiple access","interference (signal)","light interference","maximum likelihood detection","optical fibre communication","optical fibre dispersion","optical limiters","optical modulation","optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiwavelength optical CDMA system","code-division multiple-access system","multicode modulation signalling","maximum-likelihood detection","optical hard limiters","linear dispersive channels","multiple-access interference","optical-beating interference","on-off keying modulation","pulse-position modulation","optical fiber receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiwavelength optical code-division multiple access (MW-OCDMA)","Chromatic dispersion","Multicode modulation (MCM)","Optical hard limiter (OHL)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 October 2010","displayDocTitle":"Reducing the Dispersion Effects in Multiwavelength Optical CDMA Systems by Using MCM Signaling","volume":"2","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5613633/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2010","accessionNumber":"11698264","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing the Dispersion Effects in Multiwavelength Optical CDMA Systems by Using MCM Signaling","sourcePdf":"967.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091119S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"5670333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5670333","articleId":"5613633","onlineDate":"28 October 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5613660,"authors":[{"name":"Nejdat Demirel","affiliation":["IMS, University of Bordeaux 1, Talence, France","Research and Development, STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Nejdat","lastName":"Demirel","id":"37294260000"},{"name":"Eric Kerherv\u00e9","affiliation":["IMS, University of Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Kerherv\u00e9","id":"37277058800"},{"name":"Robert Plana","affiliation":["LAAS, University of Toulouse III, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Plana","id":"37278833200"},{"name":"Denis Pache","affiliation":["Research and Development, STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Denis","lastName":"Pache","id":"37285092300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-017-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7231-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-2-87487-017-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5613660","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"abstract":"This paper presents the performance of 79 GHz power amplifiers (PAs) for automotive short range radar (SRR) application.

Application examples show the effectiveness of the method in modeling multiport microwave devices.","publicationTitle":"The 5th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606058/5613634/05613690.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613634","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Extraction of parametric circuit models from scattering parameters of passive RF components","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613690/","conferenceDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11616761","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613690/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extraction of parametric circuit models from scattering parameters of passive RF components","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1978.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068539S","chronDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606058","isNumber":"5613634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606058","xplore-issue":"5613634","articleId":"5613690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5613691,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid Kiumarsi","affiliation":["Microwave mm Wave and Wireless Communication Laboratory (MWCL), Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran","Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Kiumarsi","id":"37591333800"},{"name":"Abdolali Abdipour","affiliation":["Microwave mm Wave and Wireless Communication Laboratory (MWCL), Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Abdolali","lastName":"Abdipour","id":"37266515300"},{"name":"Mehdi Rezvani Abkenari","affiliation":["Microwave mm Wave and Wireless Communication Laboratory (MWCL), Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi Rezvani","lastName":"Abkenari","id":"37591334300"},{"name":"Gholamreza Moradi","affiliation":["Microwave mm Wave and Wireless Communication Laboratory (MWCL), Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Gholamreza","lastName":"Moradi","id":"37404049000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-017-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7231-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-2-87487-017-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5613691","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1082},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power dividers","Couplers","Bandwidth","Band pass filters","Microwave filters","Power measurement","Insertion loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","differential amplifiers","power dividers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ka band balanced amplifier","six-port power divider","power combiner","broadband properties","symmetric structure","bandpass filters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613634","publicationTitle":"The 5th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 5th European Microwave Integrated Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606058/5613634/05613691.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Ka band balanced amplifier with six-port power divider","abstract":"In this paper for designing a Ka band balanced amplifier, a novel structure using a six-port power divider is proposed. Using this six-port power divider as a 3dB power divider and combiner, broadband properties and complete symmetric structure can be achieved. The symmetric structure leads to almost zero phase and gain unbalances between output ports of 3dB power dividers. In contrary to the conventional 3dB couplers, zero phase and gain unbalances of the proposed ones give nearly unity input and output VSWR in a balanced amplifier. If single amplifiers have grater bandwidth than the six-port power divider, there will be a critical instability problem in the balanced amplifier which utilizes six-port power divider. The problem was solved by inserting band pass filters in the power divider. So, using these band pass filters within the six-port power divider forms a novel balanced amplifier design which is proposed in this paper. The simulated and measured results are reported.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5613691/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11616762","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Ka band balanced amplifier with six-port power divider","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Ka band balanced amplifier with six-port power divider","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1936.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041778S","chronDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606058","isNumber":"5613634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606058","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5613634","articleId":"5613691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5613693,"authors":[{"name":"Kazukiyo Joshin","affiliation":["Fujitsu Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazukiyo","lastName":"Joshin","id":"37266834300"},{"name":"Yoichi Kawano","affiliation":["Fujitsu Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoichi","lastName":"Kawano","id":"37264869200"},{"name":"Xiaoyu Mi","affiliation":["Fujitsu Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Mi","id":"37324947800"},{"name":"Osamu Toyoda","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Osamu","lastName":"Toyoda","id":"37410784100"},{"name":"Toshihide Suzuki","affiliation":["Fujitsu Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihide","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37276138000"},{"name":"Tatsuya Hirose","affiliation":["Fujitsu Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Hirose","id":"37267175800"},{"name":"Satoshi Ueda","affiliation":["Fujitsu Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Ueda","id":"37330096900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-017-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7231-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-2-87487-017-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5613693","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":545},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Band pass filters","Micromechanical devices","CMOS integrated circuits","Power generation","Broadband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","field effect MMIC","impedance matching","micromechanical devices","microwave filters","MMIC power amplifiers","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["K-band","CMOS based power amplifier module","MEMS tunable bandpass filter","tunable power amplifier module","CMOS based broadband power amplifier","two stage cascode configuration","broadband output matching circuit","reconfigurable radio front end modules","frequency 16 GHz to 26 GHz","size 90 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613693","abstract":"This paper presents a novel tunable power amplifier module consisting of a CMOS-based broadband power amplifier and a MEMS tunable bandpass filter in K-band.

The balanced active frequency-multiplier-by-six provides 0 dBm of output power in the frequency range from 110 to 152 GHz. When directly driven by the multiplier output power, the combination of frequency doubler and resistive mixer achieves a conversion loss of 20 dB.

The LNA provides pre-amplification by 20 dB at 290 GHz with an estimated noise figure of 7.5 dB, taking the overall receiver performance to a maximum conversion gain of 8 dB and noise figure of 7.6 dB, rivaling the performance of state-of-the-art Schottky receivers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613743/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11616812","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613743/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An all-active MMIC-based chip set for a wideband 260\u2013304 GHz receiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An all-active MMIC-based chip set for a wideband 260\u2013304 GHz receiver","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073471S","chronDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606058","isNumber":"5613634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606058","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5613634","articleId":"5613743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5613805,"authors":[{"name":"Dieter Duyck","affiliation":["Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Dieter","lastName":"Duyck","id":"37392247900"},{"name":"Marc Moeneclaey","affiliation":["Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moeneclaey","id":"37269902700"},{"name":"Marwan H.

Error-correcting codes have to be carefully designed to achieve the promised gains. Good LDPC codes are known for fading channels and for Gaussian channels, but an LDPC code ensemble that performs well on both channels has not yet been presented in the literature. This paper merges two families of LDPC codes into a universal LDPC code ensemble for both fading channels and Gaussian channels. Furthermore, the new universal LDPC code ensemble outperforms previously proposed codes on the block fading channel, which is explained through a fading space analysis. Simulation of the word error rate performance of the new proposed family of LDPC codes shows that it performs well on both fading channels and Gaussian channels.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613805","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613805","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606059/5613802/05613805.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal LDPC codes for cooperative communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Universal LDPC codes for cooperative communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11616923","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5613805/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal LDPC codes for cooperative communications","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"299185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065439S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606059","isNumber":"5613802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606059","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5613802","articleId":"5613805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5613806,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Marinoni","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Marinoni","id":"37545016600"},{"name":"Pietro Savazzi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Savazzi","id":"37348198100"},{"name":"Richard D.

The proposed construction method achieves the maximum gain when the average column weight is chosen so that the linear minimum distance growth property is satisfied. In this region, the benefit of a protograph-based design over a standard PEG approach was 0.3 dB. We found that a careful field-element selection algorithm provides about 0.1 dB of improvement over random field-element selection. Overall, the proposed improvements yielded 0.4 dB of gain over a PEG-based GF(16) code with randomly selected Galois field elements. The performance of this baseline GF(16) code was comparable to the best known binary LDPC code for 16-QAM, so that the proposed improvements allow the GF(16) LDPC code to outperform known binary approaches.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613806","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606059/5613802/05613806.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protograph-based q-ary LDPC codes for higher-order modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Protograph-based q-ary LDPC codes for higher-order modulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613806/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11616924","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613806/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protograph-based q-ary LDPC codes for higher-order modulation","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"298973.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067989S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606059","isNumber":"5613802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606059","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5613802","articleId":"5613806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5613808,"authors":[{"name":"Marcel Jar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Jar","id":"37542420000"},{"name":"Christian Schlegel","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schlegel","id":"37275119900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6746-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6744-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6745-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"5613808","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","error statistics","Gaussian processes","MIMO communication","multipath channels","radiofrequency interference","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO multipath channel","jointly Gaussian approach","transmitted signal detection","multiple-input multiple-output multipath channel","residual interference","communication system","computational complexity","signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio","JGA method","system performance","bit error rate","SINR analysis"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an extension of the jointly Gaussian approach (JGA) to detect signals transmitted over a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multipath channel is presented. This method, dubbed extended JGA, enhances the performance of the JGA by performing a marginalization over some interfering terms before applying the jointly Gaussian assumption to remove the residual interference. Hence, it can improve the performance of a communication system at the expense of a controllable increase in the computational complexity. The signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) at the detector's output is analyzed to indicate how much the extended JGA method can enhance the system's performance. Bit error rate (BER) curves are used to corroborate the gain in performance pointed by the SINR analysis for realistic MIMO scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613808","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606059/5613802/05613808.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613802","startPage":"404","endPage":"408","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended jointly Gaussian approach for MIMO multipath channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Extended jointly Gaussian approach for MIMO multipath channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613808/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11616926","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5613808/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended jointly Gaussian approach for MIMO multipath channels","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"299582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04395S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606059","isNumber":"5613802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606059","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5613802","articleId":"5613808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5613812,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Laendner","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute of Integrated Circuits and Systems, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Laendner","id":"37269352600"},{"name":"Olgica Milenkovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Olgica","lastName":"Milenkovic","id":"37269359700"},{"name":"Johannes B.

More specifically, we propose a network coded LDPC coding scheme for the M - 1 - 1 system where network coding over all sources' data is performed at the relay. A challenge in such a scheme is the code design for asymmetric channels where each source has different code rate. To address this issue, we present here a novel scheme named network coded multi-edge type LDPC code (NCMET-LDPC).

We propose a VDMM optimization strategy, as a crucial part for the P-LDPC coded modulation, by checking different permutation patterns between the variable nodes in protograph and the modulated bits. Then, we develop a modified EXIT analysis for evaluating the thresholds for P-LDPC coded modulation. For some specified P-LDPC codes and 16QAM constellations, the optimum patterns for VDMM can be obtained by a limited number of searches based on the modified EXIT analysis. We find that for a certain labeling, the edge distributions of the protogragh structure should be taken into consideration, rather than using the water-filling strategy or BICM approach.

The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that properly designed LDPC can perform well simultaneously over a wide range of channel parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC code design for transmission of correlated sources across noisy channels without CSIT","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613829","startPage":"467","endPage":"471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613802","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606059/5613802/05613829.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"LDPC code design for transmission of correlated sources across noisy channels without CSIT","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613829/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11616851","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC code design for transmission of correlated sources across noisy channels without CSIT","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"314893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051245S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606059","isNumber":"5613802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606059","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5613802","articleId":"5613829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5613831,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Schlegel","affiliation":["University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, CANADA"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schlegel","id":"37275119900"},{"name":"Marat Burnashev","affiliation":["University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, CANADA"],"firstName":"Marat","lastName":"Burnashev","id":"37299544500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6746-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6744-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6745-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"5613831","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"abstract":"Limits of performance of error control coding in iterative cancellation systems using direct cancelation, or MMSE cancelation, are explored.

Adaptive network coded cooperation (ANCC) is one of these numerous works that combine network and channel coding to match network-on-graph to code-on-graph. Since the network consists of unpredictable fading channels, the link failure and time varying network topology have to be considered. In this paper, we consider an extreme channel condition where the relays fail to decode the received information to create parity check symbols, this results in no protection for the corresponding information messages at the sink. We present a channel selection solution and investigate the performance of the proposed scheme. Furthermore, based on the proposed scheme, a repeat accumulate (RA) code structure is introduced into the JNCC design by following an extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart and simulation results show a considerable performance improvement.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613834","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606059/5613802/05613834.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613802","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","startPage":"429","endPage":"433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint network-channel code design for real wireless relay networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613834/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11616856","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint network-channel code design for real wireless relay networks","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"314940.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.166281S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606059","isNumber":"5613802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606059","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"5613802","articleId":"5613834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5613835,"authors":[{"name":"Yixuan Xie","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Yixuan","lastName":"Xie","id":"37594158000"},{"name":"John C.

In contrast to traditional method of lifting, our lifting method use a combination of different circulant matrix sizes for the base protograph and accumulator to increase the number of achievable rates. We apply this method to an existing code family called AR4JA, which can offer variable rates of R = n+1/n+2 by process of extension. The proposed codes namely mixed-circulant rate-compatible protograph code (MCRC-PC) can reduce the rate step within the AR4JA family. We show that the proposed codes can also retain many of the favorable properties of protograph codes such as a fast encoder and decoder implementation. A set of length k=1024 MCRC-PC codes is designed with decoding thresholds obtained from multi-edge type density evolution, and simulation results show that the rate compatible code family can achieve good performance under message passing decoding algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613835","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606059/5613802/05613835.pdf","startPage":"434","endPage":"438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of rate-compatible protograph-based LDPC codes with mixed circulants","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design of rate-compatible protograph-based LDPC codes with mixed circulants","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613835/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11616858","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613835/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of rate-compatible protograph-based LDPC codes with mixed circulants","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"314974.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061471S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606059","isNumber":"5613802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606059","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5613802","articleId":"5613835","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5613836,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Hui Tan","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Peng Hui","lastName":"Tan","id":"37271340100"},{"name":"Chin Keong Ho","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chin Keong","lastName":"Ho","id":"37276277800"},{"name":"Sumei Sun","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Sumei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37278775200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6746-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6744-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6745-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"5613836","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field-flow fractionation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","fading channels","frequency division multiple access","iterative decoding","OFDM modulation","set theory","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM system","diversity order analysis","code design","half-duplex cooperative multiple-access channel","block-fading channel","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wideband transmission","finite constellation set","CMAC","time sharing variable","multiple turbo code","extrinsic information transfer chart analysis","iterative decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613836","abstract":"In this paper, we consider the half-duplex cooperative multiple-access channel (CMAC) in block-fading channels.

After a review of the state-of-the-art, we focus on an original solution to significantly reduce the order of complexity of the Extended Min-Sum decoder at the elementary check node level. The main originality of the so-called Bubble Check algorithm is the two-dimensional strategy for the check node processing, which leads to a reduction of the number of comparisons. The simulation results obtained for the Bubble Check show that this complexity reduction does not introduce any performance loss and that it is even possible to further reduce the number of comparisons. This motivated the search of a simplified architecture and led to the L-Bubble Check, which is the main contribution of the paper. The implementation of a forward/backward check node as a systolic architecture of L-Bubble elementary checks is also described.

We propose an interactive protocol for information reconciliation based on low-density parity-check codes. The coding rate is adapted in real time by using simultaneously puncturing and shortening strategies, allowing it to cover a predefined error rate range with just a single code.

Iterative multiuser detection and decoding (MUDD) based on generalized posterior mean estimation and single-user sum-product decoding is assumed to be used at the receiver. The channel state information (CSI) at the MUDD is mismatched and obtained by a linear channel estimator whose initial decisions are iteratively refined with the help of information feedback provided by the MUDD. Furthermore, a new training method by means of probability-biased signaling is proposed. The results indicate that in the large system limit and under certain threshold loads, a near single-user performance with perfect CSI can be achieved using a vanishing training overhead. It is also found that for the considered setups, the iterative linear minimum mean square error based channel estimator is near optimal for relatively slowly time-varying multipath fading channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative channel estimation, detection, and decoding in large CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613863","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606059/5613802/05613863.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"23","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Iterative channel estimation, detection, and decoding in large CDMA systems","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613863/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11616880","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative channel estimation, detection, and decoding in large CDMA systems","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"000008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086412S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606059","isNumber":"5613802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606059","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5613802","articleId":"5613863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5613865,"authors":[{"name":"Pulkit Grover","affiliation":["EECS Department, Wireless Foundations, University of California Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pulkit","lastName":"Grover","id":"37398027100"},{"name":"Kristen Ann Woyach","affiliation":["EECS Department, Wireless Foundations, University of California Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kristen Ann","lastName":"Woyach","id":"37392017000"},{"name":"Hari Palaiyanur","affiliation":["EECS Department, Wireless Foundations, University of California Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hari","lastName":"Palaiyanur","id":"37392038600"},{"name":"Anant Sahai","affiliation":["EECS Department, Wireless Foundations, University of California Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Anant","lastName":"Sahai","id":"37266769200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6746-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6744-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6745-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"5613865","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Signal to noise ratio","Throughput","Lakes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","decoding","interference (signal)","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference-aware perspective","decoding power","transmit power saving","capacity-approaching codes","minimal transmitted energy-per-bit","wireless system designs","uncoded transmission","face interference","transmitter-receiver pairs"]}],"abstract":"Traditionally, coding has been seen as a way of saving transmit power: capacity-approaching codes require minimal transmitted energy-per-bit given the bandwidth available. But because transmit power is often smaller than decoding power at short distances, many recent wireless system designs continue to use uncoded transmission! We first observe that in wireless systems that both generate and face interference, coding serves another purpose (assuming interference is treated as noise): it allows a system to support a higher density of transmitter-receiver pairs. Bringing decoding power into the picture, we propose an approach to investigate which code/decoder to use and whether to use any coding at all. It turns out that the code's gap to capacity determines how high the maximum supportable link density can be when power is plentiful, whereas the code's decoding complexity governs what link densities can be supported at low power.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613865","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606059/5613802/05613865.pdf","startPage":"457","endPage":"461","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An interference-aware perspective on decoding power","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613865","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An interference-aware perspective on decoding power","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613865/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11616885","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613865/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interference-aware perspective on decoding power","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"000011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050796S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606059","isNumber":"5613802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606059","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5613802","articleId":"5613865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5613866,"authors":[{"name":"Chongbin Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR","Department of Electronic Enzineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chongbin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536483400"},{"name":"Li Ping","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Ping","id":"37279033100"},{"name":"Xiaojun Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR"],"firstName":"Xiaojun","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37403854800"},{"name":"Xiaokang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Department of Electronic Enzineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaokang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37274732000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6746-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6744-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6745-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"5613866","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Variable speed drives","Mobile communication","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","diversity reception","forward error correction","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","linear codes","MIMO communication","precoding","radio transmitters","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint beamforming","water-filling","diversity coding","MIMO system","CSIT Uncertainty","multiple-input multiple-output system","channel state information","transmitter","FEC coding","linear preceding","iterative linear minimum mean squared error detection","forward error control code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["imperfect CSIT","precoding","iterative LMMSE detection","beamforming","water-filling and diversity coding"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the transmission problem in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT).

Both systematic and nonsystematic LT codes are considered from the perspectives of decoding threshold and bit error rate. Using systematic LT codes, coding complexity can be reduced by eliminating the need for decoder-doping, and less parity bits are required as compared to the nonsystematic LT codes. In addition, systematic LT codes exhibit better performance than their nonsystematic counterparts for low fixed code rates. To evaluate the performance of the LT coded MSK system, we consider a family of rate-compatible fixed-rate codes, which allows us to use extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts for analysis and design. We observe that systematic LT codes have a better decoding threshold than their corresponding nonsystematic counterparts for all tested rates up to R = 0.59 bits per symbol. Furthermore, with the use of EXIT charts, we propose a new degree distribution function for the LT code, which leads to improved decoding thresholds for all examined code rates, as compared to codes using existing degree distributions optimized for binary erasure and AWGN channels. Numerical results confirm our EXIT chart analysis and conclusions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lead","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","binary codes","communication complexity","decoding","error statistics","minimum shift keying","transform coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LT coded MSK system","AWGN channel","Luby transform code","minimum-shift-keying modulation","additive white Gaussian noise channel","systematic LT code","nonsystematic LT code","decoding","bit error rate","coding complexity","decoder-doping","parity bits","rate-compatible fixed-rate code","extrinsic information transfer chart","degree distribution function","binary erasure channel","EXIT chart analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613883","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613883","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606059/5613802/05613883.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613883","startPage":"289","endPage":"293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613802","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LT coded MSK over AWGN channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"LT coded MSK over AWGN channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613883/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613883/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11616898","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LT coded MSK over AWGN channels","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"315167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097423S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606059","isNumber":"5613802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606059","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5613802","articleId":"5613883","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5613885,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco J.

We report on empirical evidence which suggests that the same phenomenon also occurs when transmission takes place over a general binary memoryless symmetric channel. This is confirmed both by simulations as well as by computing EBP GEXIT curves and by comparing the empirical BP thresholds of coupled ensembles to the empirically determined MAP thresholds of the underlying regular ensembles.

Communication systems employing SM have a theoretical potential to approach the Gaussian channel capacity without using active signal shaping. This paper tackles several critical issues of SM and provides corresponding solutions. We point out that repetition coding is often an indispensable part for SM systems, a topic which has been obscured for a long time. More importantly, the bandwidth efficiency limit of SM systems with equal power allocation of about 2 bits per symbol per dimension can be eliminated by using irregular repetition codes. Following this cognition, we propose a universal coding approach, called low-density hybrid-check (LDHC) coding, for SM systems with arbitrary power allocation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606059/5613802/05613890.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"318","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613802","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A universal coding approach for superposition mapping","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","encoding","Gaussian channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["universal coding approach","superposition mapping","Gaussian channel capacity","low density hybrid check coding","LDHC coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A universal coding approach for superposition mapping","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613890/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11616901","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A universal coding approach for superposition mapping","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"315241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07577S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606059","isNumber":"5613802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606059","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5613802","articleId":"5613890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5613891,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Lentmaier","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lentmaier","id":"37283339900"},{"name":"David G.M.

IP formulation of the ML decoding problem can be modified to calculate the minimum distance of the code also. The IP based approach for MD calculation can be effectively used for small block length codes. However, it is not known if this approach is useful for the moderate and long length codes used in practice. In this paper we demonstrate the usefulness of the IP based approach for the MD calculation by applying it to practically relevant codes. We calculate either the true MD or upper bounds on the MD for 3GPP LTE turbo codes, WiMax duo-binary turbo codes and WiMax & WiFi low density parity-check codes. A new IP formulation is also introduced to calculate the MD of punctured turbo codes. Along with MD calculation, the same IP formulation is used to find multiplicity of low weight codewords. Our results prove that, the IP based approach can estimate the MD of practically relevant codes fairly quickly and can also provide information about the multiplicity of codewords with a given Hamming weight. Also, the IP based method for the MD calculation is independent of the code used and can easily accommodate puncturing schemes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613894","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606059/5613802/05613894.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"333","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculating the minimum distance of linear block codes via Integer Programming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Calculating the minimum distance of linear block codes via Integer Programming","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5613894/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11616908","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613894/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculating the minimum distance of linear block codes via Integer Programming","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"317141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050053S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606059","isNumber":"5613802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606059","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5613802","articleId":"5613894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5613896,"authors":[{"name":"Lara Dolecek","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Lara","lastName":"Dolecek","id":"37295938100"},{"name":"Jiadong Wang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jiadong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599877400"},{"name":"Zhengya Zhang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Zhengya","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37069308700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6746-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6744-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6745-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"5613896","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613896","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC code","absorbing set spectrum","parity check matrix","BER","error floor"]}],"abstract":"This paper focuses on methods for a systematic modification of the parity check matrix of regular LDPC codes for improved performance in the low BER region (i.e., the error floor). A judicious elimination of dominant absorbing sets strictly improves the absorbing set spectrum and thereby improves the code performance. This absorbing set elimination is accomplished without compromising code properties and parameters such as the girth, node degree, and the structure of the parity check matrix. For a representative class of practical codes we substantiate theoretical analysis with experimental results obtained in the low BER region. Our results demonstrate at least an order of magnitude improvement of the error floor relative to the original code designs. Given that the conventional code parameters remain intact, the new code can easily be implemented on the existing software or hardware platforms employing high-throughput, compact architectures. As such, the proposed approach provides a step towards the improved code design that is compatible with practical implementation constraints.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2010.5613896","startPage":"477","endPage":"481","publicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th International Symposium on Turbo Codes & Iterative Information Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606059/5613802/05613896.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards improved LDPC code designs using absorbing set spectrum properties","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613896/","conferenceDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Towards improved LDPC code designs using absorbing set spectrum properties","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11616910","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5613896/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards improved LDPC code designs using absorbing set spectrum properties","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"317281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09881S","chronDate":"6-10 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606059","isNumber":"5613802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606059","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5613802","articleId":"5613896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5613897,"authors":[{"name":"Eirik Rosnes","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"],"firstName":"Eirik","lastName":"Rosnes","id":"37272234600"},{"name":"Guang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"],"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37594684700"},{"name":"\u00d8yvind Ytrehus","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"],"firstName":"\u00d8yvind","lastName":"Ytrehus","id":"37272233200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6746-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6744-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6745-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4700"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"5613897","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":224},"abstract":"Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes are designed for error detection, but can in principle be used for error correction.

Since S-random interleavers of short length are easily found by computer search, the overall complexity of constructing longer-length interleaver is relatively low while retaining comparable performance with regular S-random interleavers of full length.

At the core of the algorithm lies the analysis of the graphical structure of dominant trapping sets and the relationship of such structures to short cycles. The algorithm is universal in the sense that it can be used for an arbitrary graph and that it can be tailored to find other graphical objects, such as absorbing sets and Zyablov-Pinsker (ZP) trapping sets, known to dominate the performance of LDPC codes in the error floor region over different channels and for different iterative decoding algorithms. Simulation results on several LDPC codes demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

To compare the parallel execution performance to a serial, results of a high speed parallel turbo demodulation software model are presented. For a highly parallel turbo demodulation system, comprised of 16 demappers and 32 decoders running concurrently, the throughput can be enhanced 27 times as compared to a serial architecture for 16-QAM modulation. Parallelism efficiency is also tabulated for 16-QAM and 256-QAM, with different architectural configurations which can benefit the hardware designer about architectural efficiency to attain high

In this letter, we have applied the nonlinear support vector data description (SVDD) to perform full-pixel target detection. Using a pure target signature and a first-order Markov model, we have developed a novel pattern recognition algorithm to train an SVDD to characterize the target class. We have inserted target signatures into an urban HS scene with varying levels of spectral variability to explore the performance of the proposed SVDD target detector in different scenarios. The proposed approach makes no assumptions regarding the underlying distribution of the scene data as do traditional stochastic detectors such as the matched filter (MF). Detection results in the form of confusion matrices, and receiver-operating-characteristic curves demonstrate that the proposed SVDD-based algorithm is highly accurate and yields higher true positive rates and lower false positive rates than the MF.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2010.2078795","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/8859/5719364/05613915.pdf","startPage":"384","endPage":"388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2010.2078795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5719364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An SVDD-Based Algorithm for Target Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613915/","displayDocTitle":"An SVDD-Based Algorithm for Target Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery","volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11834110","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613915/","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An SVDD-Based Algorithm for Target Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery","sourcePdf":"lgrs-sakla-2078795-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080033S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"5719364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5719364","articleId":"5613915","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5613919,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The disturbances are assumed to be composed by a known number of distinct sinusoidal signals with unknown phases, amplitude and frequencies. Under suitable assumptions, an exponentially convergent estimator of the unknown disturbance parameters is proposed and introduced into the classical robust regulator design to obtain an adaptive controller. This controller guarantees that the closed-loop robust regulation is attained in some neighborhood of the nominal values of the parameters of system. A simulated example shows the validity of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/5685320/05613919.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2010.2090409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2010.2090409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685320","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Structurally Stable Globally Adaptive Internal Model Regulator for MIMO Linear Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regulators","Robustness","Frequency control","Equations","Linear systems","Adaptive systems","Adaptation model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","linear systems","MIMO systems","robust control","signal processing","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structurally stable globally adaptive internal model regulator","MIMO linear systems","uncertain disturbance","sinusoidal signals","robust regulator design","adaptive controller","closed-loop robust regulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency estimation","nonlinear systems","regulation theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Structurally Stable Globally Adaptive Internal Model Regulator for MIMO Linear Systems","volume":"56","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5613919/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11733578","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Structurally Stable Globally Adaptive Internal Model Regulator for MIMO Linear Systems","sourcePdf":"tac-obregonpulido-2090409-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07918S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"5685320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5685320","articleId":"5613919","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5613922,"authors":[{"name":"Yen-Jen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Jen","lastName":"Chang","id":"37279580900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"5613922","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":563},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"Due to having an additional \u201cdon't care\u201d state, ternary content addressable memory (TCAM) is widely used in the forwarding table of the network router. However, the power consumption of TCAM is usually considerable. Instead of reducing the TCAM dynamic power, this brief introduces a leakage-suppressed technique, called dynamic power source (DPS), in which the TCAM leakage power is minimized by connecting the prefix power source to the mask data. Based on a 45-nm predictive technology model, the simulation results show that the DPS technique can deliver a TCAM leakage power reduction of 17% for a collection of real routing tables. In addition, the DPS also improves the search performance by 11% and reduces 18% of the TCAM dynamic power dissipated in the search-line switching activity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/5638302/05613922.pdf","startPage":"888","endPage":"892","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2010.2082950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2010.2082950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5638302","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using the Dynamic Power Source Technique to Reduce TCAM Leakage Power","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Computer architecture","Computer aided manufacturing","Microprocessors","Circuit stability","Transistors","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic power source technique","ternary content addressable memory","TCAM leakage power reduction","forwarding table","network router","prefix power source","routing tables","search-line switching activity","size 45 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forwarding table","leakage power (LP)","ternary content addressable memory (TCAM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Using the Dynamic Power Source Technique to Reduce TCAM Leakage Power","volume":"57","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5613922/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641566","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the Dynamic Power Source Technique to Reduce TCAM Leakage Power","sourcePdf":"tcsii-chang-2082950-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067419S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5638302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5638302","articleId":"5613922","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5613925,"authors":[{"name":"Vesna Javor","affiliation":["Department of Theoretical Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Nis, Nis, Serbia"],"firstName":"Vesna","lastName":"Javor","id":"37443370400"},{"name":"Predrag D.

The issue of the demodulation process is the key point of this paper. A novel approach based on discrete Fourier transform and nonconventional reference frame transformation is presented, allowing a simple and robust noncoherent demodulation, i.e., in which no information about the carrier phase is needed. In the classically adopted coherent approaches, in fact, uncertainty about carrier phase reflects in uncertainty in the demodulated signal amplitude, affecting observer gains and signal-to-noise ratio and definitively providing a degradation of the performance of the estimator. Analytical development of the sensorless algorithm, including the demodulation technique, is provided. A complete investigation by simulation is carried out aiming at showing the performance of the proposed method. Finally, experimental results are presented based on a prototype motor drive for city scooters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/5688725/05613932.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2010.2090317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2010.2090317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5688725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613932","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless Control of IPM Motors in the Low-Speed Range and at Standstill by HF Injection and DFT Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Demodulation","Rotors","Discrete Fourier transforms","Synchronous motors","Estimation error","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","discrete Fourier transforms","machine control","motor drives","motorcycles","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IPM motors","interior permanent magnet synchronous motor","sensorless control","low-speed range","HF injection","DFT processing","signal injection","discrete Fourier transform","nonconventional reference frame transformation","noncoherent demodulation","motor drive","city scooters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)","interior permanent-magnet (IPM) motors","sensorless control","signal injection techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613932/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless Control of IPM Motors in the Low-Speed Range and at Standstill by HF Injection and DFT Processing","volume":"47","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5613932/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11759945","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless Control of IPM Motors in the Low-Speed Range and at Standstill by HF Injection and DFT Processing","sourcePdf":"tia-petrella-2090317-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077976S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"5688725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5688725","articleId":"5613932","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5613936,"authors":[{"name":"A.

As a result, only the single-channel noise reduction schemes can be integrated in them. However, in the near future, binaural hearing aids will be available. These hearing aids will allow hearing devices on each side of the head to receive information from the microphones located on both devices via a wireless link. This additional information allows the use of joint statistics and/or spatial information, which allows the use of better denoising methods. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce a binaural target power spectral density (PSD) estimator for binaural hearing aids under the presence of a background interfering talker (or a lateral transient noise). This paper then presents an example of how the proposed target PSD estimator and another recently developed binaural diffuse noise PSD estimator can be integrated to produce a binaural noise reduction scheme that can operate in real-life complex acoustic environments that are composed of time-varying diffuse noise, multiple directional nonstationary talkers (or noises), and reverberant conditions. Such a binaural noise reduction system allows the substantial reduction of different combinations of diverse background noises and the increase in speech intelligibility while guaranteeing the preservation of the interaural cues of both the target speech and the directional background noises. A comparison with several advanced denoising algorithms is made in this paper by using several objective measures and real-life hearing aid signals, showing the good performance of the example binaural noise reduction scheme that uses the proposed PSD estimator.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2010.2084690","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5725255/05613936.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5725255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2010.2084690","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","startPage":"1141","endPage":"1154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instantaneous Binaural Target PSD Estimation for Hearing Aid Noise Reduction in Complex Acoustic Environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Instantaneous Binaural Target PSD Estimation for Hearing Aid Noise Reduction in Complex Acoustic Environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613936/","volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5613936/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11850863","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instantaneous Binaural Target PSD Estimation for Hearing Aid Noise Reduction in Complex Acoustic Environments","sourcePdf":"tim-bouchard-2084690-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071447S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5725255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5725255","articleId":"5613936","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5613938,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Saponara","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5679854/5613938/5613938-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sergio Saponara received the Laurea (cum laude) and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from the University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, in 1999 and 2003, respectively.","In 2002, he was a Marie Curie Research Fellow with the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre, Leuven, Belgium.

We call this neuron a multivalued neuron with a periodic activation function (MVN-P). The MVN-Ps functionality is much higher than that of the regular MVN. The MVN-P is more efficient in solving various classification problems. A learning algorithm based on the error-correction rule for the MVN-P is also presented. It is shown that a single MVN-P can easily learn and solve those benchmark classification problems that were considered unsolvable using a single neuron.

The operating principles and steady-state analyses of continuous-conduction mode and boundary-conduction mode are discussed in detail. To verify the performance of the proposed converter, a 280-W prototype sample is implemented with an input voltage range of 20-40 V and an output voltage of up to 400 V.

Conventional cooperation techniques require sharing large amounts of information over finite-capacity backhaul links and assume that base stations have full channel state information (CSI) of all the active users in the system. In this paper, a new limited feedback strategy is proposed for multicell beamforming where cooperation is restricted to sharing only the CSI of active users among base stations. The system setup considered is a linear array of cells based on the \u201csoft hand-off model,\u201d where each cell contains single-antenna users and multi-antenna base stations. Beamforming vectors are designed using a generalized eigenvector approach to maximize the sum-rate in a single-interferer scenario, at high signal to noise ratio. Users are assumed to feedback quantized CSI of the desired and interfering channels using a finite-bandwidth feedback link. An upper bound on the mean loss in sum rate due to random vector quantization is derived. A new feedback-bit allocation strategy, to partition the available bits between the desired and interfering channels, is developed to reduce the mean loss in sum-rate due to quantization for the soft hand-off model. The proposed feedback-bit partitioning algorithm is shown, using simulations, to yield sum-rates close to the those obtained using full CSI at base station.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2090346","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5685344/05613944.pdf","startPage":"800","endPage":"811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2090346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Limited Feedback for Sum-Rate Maximizing Beamforming in Cooperative Multicell Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613944/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Limited Feedback for Sum-Rate Maximizing Beamforming in Cooperative Multicell Systems","volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11742850","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5613944/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Limited Feedback for Sum-Rate Maximizing Beamforming in Cooperative Multicell Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-bhagavatula-2090346-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114339S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5685344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"5685344","articleId":"5613944","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5613945,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel S.

Therefore, 3000 full charge-discharge cycles are applied to the cells with high constant current rates. Through reference testing, increasing battery impedance and a fading capacity are identified as a consequence of battery aging. Capacity fade proceeds in a way that cells' open-circuit voltages (OCVs) change only in the range of high state-of-charge (SOC). A model-based method that can detect the decreasingly utilizable capacity is outlined. The proposed method considers the changing OCV characteristics and enables the determination of capacity loss without complete charge and discharge being necessary during battery operation. By the evaluation of capacity loss information, an accelerated battery aging or even possible battery damage caused by overcharge can be avoided during battery charging scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Utilizable Capacity Deterioration in Battery Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2090370","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5689379/05613947.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2090370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5689379","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613947/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Utilizable Capacity Deterioration in Battery Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5613947/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11759910","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Utilizable Capacity Deterioration in Battery Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-roscher-2090370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062833S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5689379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"5689379","articleId":"5613947","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5613948,"authors":[{"name":"Roc Berenguer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA","CEIT, Communication IC Design Group, Spain"],"firstName":"Roc","lastName":"Berenguer","id":"37268820300"},{"name":"Gui Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Gui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37540053400"},{"name":"Yang Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37277721400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5613948","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1297},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5613948","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrostatic discharge","Radio frequency","Transmission line measurements","Millimeter wave integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","Low-noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","electrostatic discharge","integrated circuit noise","low noise amplifiers","low-power electronics","millimetre wave amplifiers","MIMIC","transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise amplifier","low power amplifier","area efficient RF-ESD protection","electrostatic discharge protection structure","noise figure","inductive cancellation method","transmission line pulse ESD currents","frequency 77 GHz","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits (ICs)","electrostatic discharge (ESD) cancellation technique","low noise amplifiers (LNAs)","millimeter-wave (mmW) circuits","transmission line pulse (TLP)"]}],"abstract":"An area efficient electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection structure is presented to protect the RF input PAD of a 77 GHz low noise amplifier in a 65 nm CMOS process.

In the operation of a microgrid, forecasting the short-term load is an important task. With a more accurate short-term loaf forecast (STLF), the microgrid can enhance the management of its renewable and conventional resources and improve the economics of energy trade with electricity markets. However, STLF for microgrids is a complex forecast process, mainly because of the highly nonsmooth and nonlinear behavior of the load time series. In this paper, characteristics of the load time series of a typical microgrid are discussed and the differences with the load time series of traditional power systems are described. In addition, a new bilevel prediction strategy is proposed for STLF of microgrids. The proposed strategy is composed of a feature selection technique and a forecast engine (including neural network and evolutionary algorithm) in the lower level as the forecaster and an enhanced differential evolution algorithm in the upper level for optimizing the performance of the forecaster. The effectiveness of the proposed prediction strategy is evaluated by the real-life data of a university campus in Canada.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2010.2078842","startPage":"286","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel5/5165411/5629465/05613970.pdf","endPage":"294","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5629465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2010.2078842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5613970/","displayDocTitle":"Short-Term Load Forecast of Microgrids by a New Bilevel Prediction Strategy","volume":"1","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5613970/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11661281","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-Term Load Forecast of Microgrids by a New Bilevel Prediction Strategy","sourcePdf":"tsg-amjady-2078842-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061475S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"5629465","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"5629465","articleId":"5613970","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5613971,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The evaluation of an error performance of LDPC codes is usually executed by using a Monte-Carlo simulation since the theoretical calculation method has not been reported. It is very difficult to evaluate an error performance of LDPC codes with finite block length when the error probability is very low. To solve this problem, some fast simulation methods by using importance sampling (IS) are proposed. However, the conventional methods can not reduce the simulation time of LDPC codes over an additive non-Gaussian noise channel because the simulation probability density function (PDF) used in IS is designed for an additive white Gaussian noise. We propose a new simulation PDF design related to the Chernoff bound to estimate an error performance of LDPC codes over an additive non-Gaussian noise channel. In addition, we show some numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed simulation method. The simulation time of the proposed method is reduced to about 1/2000 of that of the conventional method when we estimate the frame error rate of 10\n<sup

which depends on the number-controlled oscillator and the interpolator to complete timing adjustment in an all-digital way instead of the traditional hybrid way using an analog device (a voltage-controlled oscillator) to adjust the sampling frequency. Therefore it avoids introducing the nonideal characteristics of an analog device and is beneficial to all-digital implementation of optical coherent receivers. Furthermore, in order to meet the requirements of low complexity and sampling rate, the Gardner timing error detector is adopted in the all-digital timing recovery loop. However, it has low tolerance of dispersion, which requires another device to compensate the large residual dispersion prior to it. Although the adaptive equalizer can compensate signal for dispersion impairment, its effective operation must rely upon synchronized signals. For solving the incompatible problem without any extra cost, a joint scheme that embeds an adaptive equalizer into the all-digital timing recovery loop is proposed to accomplish synchronization and compensation of linear transmission impairments. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are demonstrated in a 112 Gbit/s polarization-multiplexing non-return-to-zero differential-quadrature phase-shift-keying (POLMUX-NRZ-DQPSK) optical coherent receiver by simulation.","doi":"10.1364/JOCN.2.000984","publicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Optical Communications and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/4563700/5670333/05614030.pdf","startPage":"984","endPage":"990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1364/JOCN.2.000984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5670333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-Digital Timing Recovery and Adaptive Equalization for 112\u2009Gbit\u2215s POLMUX-NRZ-DQPSK Optical Coherent Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5614030","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5614030/","displayDocTitle":"All-Digital Timing Recovery and Adaptive Equalization for 112\u2009Gbit\u2215s POLMUX-NRZ-DQPSK Optical Coherent Receivers","volume":"2","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2010","accessionNumber":"11698266","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5614030/","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Digital Timing Recovery and Adaptive Equalization for 112\u2009Gbit\u2215s POLMUX-NRZ-DQPSK Optical Coherent Receivers","sourcePdf":"984.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142708S","chronDate":"November  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"5670333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5670333","articleId":"5614030","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5614040,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfei Mao","affiliation":["Lab of Electromagnetics, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yunfei","lastName":"Mao","id":"37592613100"},{"name":"Chaomeng Zhou","affiliation":["Control Department, China Satellite Maritime Tracking, Jiangyin, China"],"firstName":"Chaomeng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37594730800"},{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["Control Department, China Satellite Maritime Tracking, Jiangyin, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37601216500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5305-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5306-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"5614040","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Reflection","Time domain analysis","Periodic structures","Arrays","Perfectly matched layers","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave absorption","electromagnetic wave reflection","finite difference time-domain analysis","periodic structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UPML","FDTD","periodic structures","uniaxial perfectly matched layer","finite-difference time-domain method","Sherman-Morrison formula","reflection coefficient"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, uniaxial perfectly matched layer (UPML) is applied in weakly conditionally stable finite-difference time-domain method for periodic structures.

In this paper GA has been used to simultaneously select significant features as input to ANN and automatically determine the optimal number of hidden node. Meanwhile the ANN training is done by Levenberg Marquardt (LM) algorithm.

But, a higher efficiency for a multi-junction solar cell under these artificial conditions does not necessarily lead to more energy generation in a real photovoltaic concentrator system. The variation of the spectrum during the day and year is crucial to the amount of energy which can be produced. In this paper we calculate the energy which can be harvested on the basis of more than 4000 realistic spectra generated for each daytime hour of the year. Calculations are performed for three typical CPV locations in Colorado, Spain and Israel.

Sub-channels experiencing severe fading employ lower or no bit-loading while subchannels with little or no fading utilise higher bit-loading to maintain a constant system data rate.

Bit-Error-Rate (BER) performance of a high-resolution MF receiver for IR-UWB and DS-UWB is analyzed and compared under typical UWB dispersive channels. Also, performance of a 1-bit MF receiver for IR-UWB and DS-UWB is analyzed and compared under Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. The analysis results provide insight into general cases that B-bit MF receivers are used. Simulations of B-bit MF receivers are performed under both AWGN channel and typical UWB dispersive channel. The results show IR-UWB outperforms DS-UWB with finite-resolution MF receivers, and the performance superiority is more significant as quantization resolution is lower.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5614491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5614491/","accessionNumber":"11629240","displayDocTitle":"Performance superiority of IR-UWB over DS-UWB with finite-resolution Matched-Filter receivers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance superiority of IR-UWB over DS-UWB with finite-resolution Matched-Filter receivers","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"B2050432921.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051708S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606680","isNumber":"5614060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606680","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5614060","articleId":"5614491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5614686,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Chun Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kun Shan University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Chun","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37401811100"},{"name":"Yu-Lung Ke","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Penghu University, Penghu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Lung","lastName":"Ke","id":"37275822700"},{"name":"Hung-Shiang Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kao Yuan University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hung-Shiang","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37397894800"},{"name":"Chia-Chieh Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kun Shan University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Chieh","lastName":"Hu","id":"37599907200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6395-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6393-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6394-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-2618"},{"format":"CD","value":"0197-2618"}],"articleNumber":"5614686","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2553},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Converters","Light emitting diodes","Lighting","Switches","Inductors","Reactive power","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver circuits","harmonic distortion","light emitting diodes","light sources","lighting","power factor correction","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-stage power-factor-correction circuit","lighting applications","light emitting diode","incandescent bulbs","fluorescent lamps","LED voltage regulation","single-stage flyback converter","type-II compensator","phase margin","voltage mode pulse width modulation","discontinuous conduction mode","DCM","PWM","inductor","closed-loop prototype topology","LED driver circuit","LED lighting source","low total harmonic distortion","power 18 W"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5614686","abstract":"White light emitting diode (LED) with high brightness has attracted a lot of attention from both industry and academia for its high efficiency, ease to drive, environmental friendliness, and long lifespan. They become possible applications to replace the incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps in residential, industrial and commercial lighting. The realization of this new lighting source requires both tight LED voltage regulation and high power factor as well. This paper proposed a single-stage flyback converter for the LED lighting applications and input power factor correction. A type-II compensator has been inserted in the voltage loop providing sufficient bandwidth and stable phase margin. The flyback converter is controlled with voltage mode pulse width modulation (PWM) and run in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) so that the inductor current follows the rectified input voltage, resulting in high power factor. A prototype topology of closed-loop, single-stage flyback converter for LED driver circuit designed for an 18W LED lighting source is constructed and tested to verify the theoretical predictions. The measured performance of the LED lighting fixture can achieve a high power factor greater than 0.998 and a low total harmonic distortion less than 5.0%. Experimental results show the functionality of the overall system and prove it to be an effective solution for the new lighting applications.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2010.5614686","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610910/5614068/05614686.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2010.5614686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Stage Power-Factor-Correction Circuit with Flyback Converter to Drive LEDs for Lighting Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5614686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Single-Stage Power-Factor-Correction Circuit with Flyback Converter to Drive LEDs for Lighting Applications","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11626403","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5614686/","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Stage Power-Factor-Correction Circuit with Flyback Converter to Drive LEDs for Lighting Applications","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ias20p02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060986S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610910","isNumber":"5614068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610910","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5614068","articleId":"5614686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5614706,"authors":[{"name":"Hans W.

In solving imbalanced data set, it is critical to predict the minority class due to their imbalanced nature. In order to improve the standard ANN classifier prediction performance, this paper focuses on optimizing the decision boundary of the step function at the output layer of ANN using particle swarm optimization (PSO). A feedforward ANN is chosen in this study. Firstly, a conventional back propagation algorithm is employed to train the ANN. PSO is then applied to train the real predicted output of training data from this trained network. As the result, the optimum value of decision boundary is found and applied to the classifier. Prediction performance is assessed by G-mean, which is a measure to indicate the efficiency of classifiers for imbalanced data sets. Based on experimental results, the proposed model is able to solve imbalanced data sets problem with better performance compared to the standard ANN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5614727/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11626711","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5614727/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Modified Artificial Neural Network Learning Algorithm for Imbalanced Data Set Problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Artificial Neural Network Learning Algorithm for Imbalanced Data Set Problem","confLoc":"Liverpool, UK","sourcePdf":"4158a044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062283S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613973","isNumber":"5614044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613973","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5614044","articleId":"5614727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5614751,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Xu","affiliation":["Institution of RF &OE ICs, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085514396"},{"name":"Gong-Zhi Wang","affiliation":["Institution of RF &OE ICs, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Gong-Zhi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37597494000"},{"name":"Ying Zhang","affiliation":["Institution of RF &OE ICs, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089082635"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5305-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5306-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"5614751","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":158},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distributed amplifiers","Bandwidth","Power transmission lines","Impedance","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed amplifiers","gallium arsenide","heterojunction bipolar transistors","III-V semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed amplifier design","L-type networks","T-type networks","characteristic impedance","HBT process","size 2 mum","GaAs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5614751","abstract":"The characteristic impedance of L-type and T-type networks are investigated for the distributed amplifier (DA) design respectively.

The proposed hybrid method is successfully applied to the full-wave analysis of filters with great practical interest (i.e., multimode filters), thus improving CPU time and memory storage against several full-wave finite element method based computer aided design (CAD) tools.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 40th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606055/5614756/05614761.pdf","startPage":"1301","endPage":"1304","publicationTitle":"The 40th European Microwave Conference","doi":"10.23919/EUMC.2010.5614761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUMC.2010.5614761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614756","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5614761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex 2D discontinuities analysis using hybrid finite element method and a modified multimodal variational formulation-application to filter design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Microwave filters","Resonator filters","Electromagnetic waveguides","Design automation","Waveguide discontinuities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filters","finite element analysis","rectangular waveguides","variational techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex 2D discontinuities analysis","hybrid finite element method","modified multimodal variational formulation-application","filter design","cascaded uniaxial complex 2D discontinuities","rectangular waveguides","full-wave analysis","computer aided design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5614761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Complex 2D discontinuities analysis using hybrid finite element method and a modified multimodal variational formulation-application to filter design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5614761/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628253","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex 2D discontinuities analysis using hybrid finite element method and a modified multimodal variational formulation-application to filter design","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055853S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606055","isNumber":"5614756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606055","xplore-issue":"5614756","articleId":"5614761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5614776,"authors":[{"name":"Raji Sukumar A.","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Kannur University, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"Raji","lastName":"Sukumar A.","id":"37086901025"},{"name":"Sarin Sukumar A.","affiliation":["Electronic System Design Engineer, Nilogic PVT LTD, Pune, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"Sarin","lastName":"Sukumar A.","id":"37086898678"},{"name":"Firoz Shah A.","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Kannur University, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"Firoz","lastName":"Shah A.","id":"37086292272"},{"name":"Babu Anto P.","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Kannur University, Kerala, India"],"firstName":"Babu","lastName":"Anto P.","id":"38225492300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7837-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4158-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5614776","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Speech","Speech recognition","Databases","Information retrieval","Discrete cosine transforms","Speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","fast Fourier transforms","neural nets","query processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["key-word based query recognition","speech corpus","artificial neural networks","information retrieval","natural language query","spoken language information extraction","Malayalam speech query","fast Fourier transform","discrete cosine transform","feature extraction purpose"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Isolated Question Word Recognition","Discrete wavelet transform","Artificial Neural Network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5614776","abstract":"Information Retrieval deals with the easy access to the information based on the user's request, which will be presented in the form of a query.

This paper discusses a novel technique for recognition of the isolated question words from Malayalam (one of the south Indian languages) speech query. We have created and analyzed a database consisting of 500 isolated question words. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Discrete Cosine transform (DCT) is used for the feature extraction purpose and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used for classification and recognition.

The measured relative phase between the higher and lower IMD signal for specific tone spacing can be interpreted as the group delay information of the IMD signal concerned.

It concludes that the imperfect constant time interpolation method majorly affects the accuracy of the results at the high frequency end. However, the accuracy of the subgridding schemes mostly depends on the spatial interpolation methods rather than the time interpolation methods. It is also demonstrated that the FDTD subgridding schemes are still stable even when there are objects which traverse the spatial and temporal interfaces.

According to this reason, many scholars have presented some Fast Back Projection algorithms based on sub-aperture method. But how to compensate the motion error after sub-aperture dividing is awaited for further studying. The motion compensation method for FBP algorithm at different motion error levels is studied in this paper. Three situations denoting different motion error levels, which are only non-uniform in azimuth aperture, tracks of two-dimensional motion error and highly nonlinear even curvilinear flight tracks, are discussed here. Then it comes to a fast back projection imaging algorithm for arbitrary aperture, and this algorithm needs highly precise position information. Finally, an outside experiment is made to prove the algorithm's availability.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 7th European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606056/5614805/05614893.pdf","startPage":"487","endPage":"490","publicationTitle":"The 7th European Radar Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614805","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5614893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arbitrary synthetic aperture motion compensation based on Fast Back Projection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Apertures","Radar tracking","Motion compensation","Algorithm design and analysis","Tracking","Azimuth","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation","radar imaging","radar tracking","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arbitrary synthetic aperture motion compensation","fast back projection imaging algorithm","subaperture method","FBP algorithm","two-dimensional motion error","nonlinear even curvilinear flight track","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","nonuniform aperture","motion compensation","synthetic aperture imaging","monopulse radar"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5614893/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2010-Oct. 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Arbitrary synthetic aperture motion compensation based on Fast Back Projection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5614893/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11636350","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-1 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arbitrary synthetic aperture motion compensation based on Fast Back Projection","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1718.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052097S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2010-Oct. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606056","isNumber":"5614805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606056","xplore-issue":"5614805","articleId":"5614893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5614917,"authors":[{"name":"Marlene Harter","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik und Elektronik (IHE), Karlsruher Institut f\u00fcr Technologie, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Marlene","lastName":"Harter","id":"37588197000"},{"name":"Andreas Kornbichler","affiliation":["Wireless Sensor and RF-Technology (CT T DE HW 1), Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Kornbichler","id":"37586459400"},{"name":"Thomas Zwick","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Hochfrequenztechnik und Elektronik (IHE), Karlsruher Institut f\u00fcr Technologie, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Zwick","id":"37273510500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-019-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7234-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-2-87487-019-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5614917","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":457},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Array signal processing","Transmitters","Switches","Receivers","Antenna measurements","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","CW radar","FM radar","radar imaging","radar receivers","radar resolution","radar transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital beamforming","modular imaging radar sensor","multiple switched transmitters","angular resolution","FMCW radar sensor","switchable transmitters","receiver channels","switching technique","switchable amplifiers","frequency 24 GHz"]}],"abstract":"A compact modular 24 GHz imaging radar sensor for digital beamforming is presented.

In the proposed architecture, the radar mode and the radio mode operate in different time slots. The required modulated waveform is generated with the help of a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) that is able to control signal parameters such as amplitude, frequency and phase with very high resolution. For the radar mode, a specially arranged trapezoidal frequency modulation continuous-wave (TFMCW) modulation scheme is adopted, which combines three time intervals, namely an up-chirp, a constant-frequency period and a down-chirp. As such, range-velocity ambiguity can be resolved. Moreover, a constant-frequency period follows the radar cycle in the transmitted signal, which can be encoded with information data using different modulation schemes such as ASK, FSK, PSK, and some combinations among them. A low-frequency prototype for the 5.9-GHz dedicated short range communication (DSRC) system was designed and prototyped. Both system simulation results and preliminary measurement results have proved the proposed concept. The presented system has demonstrated such advantages as low cost, low complexity, and versatile functionality, which promises to play an important role in the design of future intelligent transportation system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614805","startPage":"65","endPage":"68","displayPublicationTitle":"The 7th European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606056/5614805/05614954.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 7th European Radar Conference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5614954","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Bit error rate","Frequency shift keying","Receivers","Radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","CW radar","direct digital synthesis","FM radar","frequency shift keying","phase shift keying","sensor fusion","transceivers","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar-radio data fusion","intelligent transportation system","software-defined data fusion system","radar sensing","radio communication function","transceivers","direct digital synthesizer","trapezoidal frequency modulation continuous-wave modulation radar","TFMCW radar","ASK","FSK","PSK","dedicated short range communication system","DSRC system","amplitude shift keying","frequency shift keying","phase shift keying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Radar and radio data fusion platform for future intelligent transportation system","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2010-Oct. 1 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-1 Oct. 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11636386","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5614954/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5614954/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radar and radio data fusion platform for future intelligent transportation system","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052573S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2010-Oct. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606056","isNumber":"5614805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606056","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5614805","articleId":"5614954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5614968,"authors":[{"name":"Margaritis Basdavanos","affiliation":["School of Science & Technology, Hellenic Open University, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Margaritis","lastName":"Basdavanos","id":"37597707900"},{"name":"Alexander Chatzigeorgiou","affiliation":["Department of Applied Informatics, University of Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Chatzigeorgiou","id":"37267568900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7788-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4144-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5614968","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5614968","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Couplings","Measurement","Gallium","Resource management","Optimization","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","object-oriented programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object-oriented system","single-objective genetic algorithm","state allocation","search space exploration","single-objective optimization","fitness function","Eclipse plugin"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["object-oriented design","coupling","cohesion","genetic algorithm"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614909","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances","publicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Software Engineering Advances","doi":"10.1109/ICSEA.2010.18","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Placement of Entities in Object-Oriented Systems by Means of a Single-Objective Genetic Algorithm","startPage":"70","endPage":"75","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613991/5614909/05614968.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSEA.2010.18","abstract":"Behavior and state allocation in object-oriented systems is a rather non-trivial task that is hard to master and automate since it is guided by conceptual criteria and therefore relies on human expertise. Since attributes and methods can be placed in the classes of a system in uncountable different ways, the task can be regarded as a search space exploration problem. In this paper we present our experience from treating this issue by a genetic algorithm, which in contrast to previous approaches, is aiming at single-objective optimization. The fitness function is based on a novel metric which ensures that optimization improves both coupling and cohesion. The approach has been implemented as an Eclipse plugin allowing the effortless experimentation on any system. The evaluation results indicate that the problem is suitable for single-objective genetic algorithms and that an optimal or near-optimal solution can be obtained within reasonable time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5614968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5614968/","accessionNumber":"11627533","displayDocTitle":"Placement of Entities in Object-Oriented Systems by Means of a Single-Objective Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Placement of Entities in Object-Oriented Systems by Means of a Single-Objective Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"4144a070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071541S","chronDate":"22-27 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613991","isNumber":"5614909","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613991","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5614909","articleId":"5614968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5614973,"authors":[{"name":"Pascale Jardin","affiliation":["ESYCOM, ESIEE, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Pascale","lastName":"Jardin","id":"37410569200"},{"name":"Florence Nadal","affiliation":["ESYCOM, ESIEE, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Florence","lastName":"Nadal","id":"37269609700"},{"name":"Sarah Middleton","affiliation":["University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa"],"firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Middleton","id":"37396019300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-019-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7234-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-2-87487-019-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5614973","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":430},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","MIMO radar","Narrowband","MIMO","Arrays","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","matrix algebra","MIMO radar","phased array radar","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband MIMO radar","extended signal model","spectral beampattern design","phased array radars","MIMO narrowband model","spatial power distribution","cross-spectral power density matrix","suboptimal transmit beampattern synthesis technique","wideband beamforming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","parameter identification","probing signal design","transmit beampattern","wideband beamforming"]}],"abstract":"MIMO radar systems can increase the radar resolution, the number of targets that can be identified, and the flexibility in beampattern design in comparison with standard phased array radars. To date, most of the work on MIMO radar has been performed assuming the signals are narrowband. However, wideband signals can improve radar resolution, among other benefits, and are sometimes unavoidable when stringent range resolution specifications must be met. In this paper, we present a method for extending the MIMO narrowband model to a wideband model. Next, from the exact expression of the spatial power distribution involving the CSDM (Cross-Spectral power Density Matrix), we propose a suboptimal transmit beampattern synthesis technique, which can be used in the context of wideband signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On wideband MIMO radar: Extended signal model and spectral beampattern design","publicationTitle":"The 7th European Radar Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 7th European Radar Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606056/5614805/05614973.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614805","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5614973","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5614973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 30 2010-Oct. 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"On wideband MIMO radar: Extended signal model and spectral beampattern design","conferenceDate":"30 Sept.-1 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5614973/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11636399","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On wideband MIMO radar: Extended signal model and spectral beampattern design","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048419S","chronDate":"Sept. 30 2010-Oct. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606056","isNumber":"5614805","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606056","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5614805","articleId":"5614973","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5614997,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Through computer simulations assuming fading channels, the effectiveness and features of the proposed design methods are investigated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and analysis of MIMO multiuser system under coexistence of direct and relay-aided links","publicationTitle":"The 3rd European Wireless Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 3rd European Wireless Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606053/5615105/05615126.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615105","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design and analysis of MIMO multiuser system under coexistence of direct and relay-aided links","conferenceDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615126/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628349","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and analysis of MIMO multiuser system under coexistence of direct and relay-aided links","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1832.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042021S","chronDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606053","isNumber":"5615105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606053","xplore-issue":"5615105","articleId":"5615126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5615127,"authors":[{"name":"Ancu\u0163a Moldovan","affiliation":["Communications Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Ancu\u0163a","lastName":"Moldovan","id":"37543144300"},{"name":"Irina Verme\u015fan","affiliation":["Communications Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Irina","lastName":"Verme\u015fan","id":"37546271400"},{"name":"Ana-Maria Pi\u015ftea","affiliation":["Communications Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Ana-Maria","lastName":"Pi\u015ftea","id":"37601555400"},{"name":"Rebeca Colda","affiliation":["Communications Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Rebeca","lastName":"Colda","id":"37546272800"},{"name":"Tudor Palade","affiliation":["Communications Department, Technical University of Cluj Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania"],"firstName":"Tudor","lastName":"Palade","id":"37284217300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-018-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7233-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-2-87487-018-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-3652"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-3644"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-3644"}],"articleNumber":"5615127","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitting antennas","Physical layer","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","MIMO communication","mobile communication","telecommunication network reliability","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-based WLAN system","Spatial processing techniques","mobile MIMO","multiple input multiple output systems","transmission reliability","channel state information","link speed enhancement","transmit diversity system","signal-to-noise ratio","packet error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["space diversity","spatial multiplexing","WLAN","throughput","PER"]}],"abstract":"Spatial processing techniques are considered as means to enhance the performance of WLANs systems.

However, due to its inherent drawback of high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), the OFDM based transmission may severely affect the power efficiency of RF power amplifiers. In this paper, we propose a simple approach to reduce the PAPR of MIMO-OFDM signals based on the use of unused subcarriers. In order to avoid processing the signals at each transmitter separately, a peak cancelling signal is only generated at one antenna and then employed to all the others with only simple modifications. Simulation has shown that by using this proposed approach, a minimum 2 dB reduction in PAPR can be achieved for all transmit signals. Since the generation of the peak cancellation signal for each transmitter separately is avoid, the overall cost of the system can be significantly reduced.","publicationTitle":"The 3rd European Wireless Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 3rd European Wireless Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606053/5615105/05615166.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PAPR reduction technique using unused subcarriers for SFBC-based MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615166","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615166/","displayDocTitle":"PAPR reduction technique using unused subcarriers for SFBC-based MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628367","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615166/","conferenceDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PAPR reduction technique using unused subcarriers for SFBC-based MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"2234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036723S","chronDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606053","isNumber":"5615105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606053","xplore-issue":"5615105","articleId":"5615166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5615211,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohua Lian","affiliation":["IRCTR, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Xiaohua","lastName":"Lian","id":"38362498900"},{"name":"H.

With Null Broadening (NB) technique, CR can share the spectrum and coexist with licensed users (LU) by displaying nulls to a certain range of Direction of Arrival (DOA) of LU. This paper presents a new NB technique called Virtual Direction Adding (VDA) in downlink beamforming for CR. VDA can be performed by adding two coherent signals to each LU but with different directions. Performance and comparisons show that while keeping the required width of nulls, and even with more LU and CR users, VDA achieves a deeper null than the Covariance Matrix Taper (CMT) method. By introducing VDA, CR can direct its main beam towards its own users while putting broadened nulls to the LUs' directions in the downlink, which will consequently cause less interference to LUs sharing the same spectrum.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615105","startPage":"133","endPage":"136","displayPublicationTitle":"The 3rd European Wireless Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606053/5615105/05615211.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive beamforming for Cognitive Radio with Null Broadening","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5615211/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive beamforming for Cognitive Radio with Null Broadening","conferenceDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628378","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive beamforming for Cognitive Radio with Null Broadening","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1440.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05718S","chronDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606053","isNumber":"5615105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606053","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5615105","articleId":"5615211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5615214,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is well known that pattern orthogonality is a key issue to reach low inter-element correlation, and thus to improve channel capacity. However, in the literature the attention is often focused on reducing mutual coupling instead of optimizing the active element patterns. In this paper a MIMO array of printed Yagi antennas with integrated balun is presented. The end-fire radiation mechanism of the Yagi is exploited to obtain a triangular array of three sectoral antennas. This allows to achieve nearly orthogonal patterns and low mutual coupling between neighbour elements. A properly shaped ground at the antenna feeding points allows to reach small inter-element spacings (well below 0.5 \u03bb) which are typically critical for conventional uniform linear MIMO arrays of omnidirectional radiators. The effectiveness of a planar array made of sectoral-coverage elements to improve MIMO capacity is demonstrated through numerical simulations with IEEE 802.11n channel models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel compact MIMO array based on planar Yagi antennas for multipath fading channels","publicationTitle":"The 3rd European Wireless Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 3rd European Wireless Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606053/5615105/05615214.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"96","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615105","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A novel compact MIMO array based on planar Yagi antennas for multipath fading channels","conferenceDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615214/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628379","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel compact MIMO array based on planar Yagi antennas for multipath fading channels","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095818S","chronDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606053","isNumber":"5615105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606053","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5615105","articleId":"5615214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5615219,"authors":[{"name":"H.

In the conventional cooperative strategies, relays employ either a decode-and-forward (DF) or an amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying protocol. In this paper, we investigate a new hybrid cooperative scheme that includes both DF and AF relays. First, we propose a thresholding scheme for the division of DF and AF relays. Then, we propose a dynamic optimal combination strategy for the hybrid DF-AF cooperation and removing the unsuitable AF relays. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technique is utilized to resolve the multi-path in each cooperative link. Based on space-frequency coding, the hybrid cooperative OFDM can even gain from the multi-path, and obtain the multi-path diversity. In this paper, a closed-form error probability expression for the suggested hybrid DF-AF cooperative OFDM network, under Rayleigh channel, is also provided. The resulting expression is general as it holds for an arbitrary number of cooperating DF-AF branches. Finally, the simulation results explain how diversity is improved in the hybrid cooperative diversity wireless networks.","publicationTitle":"The 3rd European Wireless Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 3rd European Wireless Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606053/5615105/05615219.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of hybrid DF-AF OFDM cooperation in Rayleigh channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615219/","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of hybrid DF-AF OFDM cooperation in Rayleigh channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628382","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615219/","conferenceDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of hybrid DF-AF OFDM cooperation in Rayleigh channel","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044667S","chronDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606053","isNumber":"5615105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606053","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5615105","articleId":"5615219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5615220,"authors":[{"name":"Anne-Lise Bouaziz","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Anne-Lise","lastName":"Bouaziz","id":"37588347700"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Kelif","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marc","lastName":"Kelif","id":"37391908400"},{"name":"Jean-Philippe Desbat","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-Les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Philippe","lastName":"Desbat","id":"37594456000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-018-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7233-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-2-87487-018-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-3652"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-3644"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-3644"}],"articleNumber":"5615220","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":499},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Throughput","Femtocells","Signal to noise ratio","Macrocell networks","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","channel capacity","indoor radio","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE femtocell capacity analytical evaluation","indoor outdoor coexistence","long term evolution femtocell network","interference","macrocell networks","LTE high date rate services","analytical network model","fluid model"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the deployment of a LTE (Long Term Evolution) femtocell network is analyzed in downlink.

Based on our analysis and the simulation result, it shows that the newly proposed algorithm can be a potential solution to a MU-MIMO downlink system with feedback resource constraint. A key finding is that an extra step with a high bits feedback can increase the system capacity, especially when signal-to-noise ratio is at high value.

Failure occurrence as well as its impact on system performance and operation costs are becoming an increasingly important concern to system designers and administrators. When a system fails to function properly, health-related data are valuable for troubleshooting. However, it is challenging to effectively detect anomalies from the voluminous amount of noisy, high-dimensional data. The traditional manual approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable. In this paper, we present an autonomic mechanism for anomaly detection in compute cloud systems. A set of techniques is presented to automatically analyze collected data: data transformation to construct a uniform data format for data analysis, feature extraction to reduce data size, and unsupervised learning to detect the nodes acting differently from others. We evaluate our prototype implementation on an institute-wide compute cloud environment. The results show that our mechanism can effectively detect faulty nodes with high accuracy and low computation overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Anomaly Detection Framework for Autonomic Management of Compute Cloud Systems","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 34th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","doi":"10.1109/COMPSACW.2010.72","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 34th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613986/5614033/05615245.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSACW.2010.72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614033","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Anomaly Detection Framework for Autonomic Management of Compute Cloud Systems","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615245/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11636131","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Anomaly Detection Framework for Autonomic Management of Compute Cloud Systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4105a376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062111S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613986","isNumber":"5614033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613986","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5614033","articleId":"5615245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5615246,"authors":[{"name":"Xianfu Chen","affiliation":["York Zhejiang Laboratory for Cognitive Radio and Green Communications, Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering ISEE, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xianfu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403972300"},{"name":"Zhifeng Zhao","affiliation":["York Zhejiang Laboratory for Cognitive Radio and Green Communications, Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering ISEE, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhifeng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37405537800"},{"name":"Honggang Zhang","affiliation":["York Zhejiang Laboratory for Cognitive Radio and Green Communications, Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering ISEE, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Honggang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280788800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-018-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7233-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-2-87487-018-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-3652"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-3644"},{"format":"CD","value":"2153-3644"}],"articleNumber":"5615246","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":407},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615246","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Green products","Cognitive radio","Games","Wireless sensor networks","Stochastic processes","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","learning (artificial intelligence)","stochastic processes","telecommunication computing","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiagent Q-learning approach","scarce spectrum resource","cognitive wireless mesh networks","noncooperative green power assignment","stochastic learning process","single-agent Q-learning","multiuser context","Q-function updates","secondary users behaviors"]}],"publicationTitle":"The 3rd European Wireless Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 3rd European Wireless Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606053/5615105/05615246.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Green transmit power assignment for cognitive radio networks by applying multi-agent Q-learning approach","abstract":"As the scarce spectrum resource is becoming over-crowded, cognitive wireless mesh networks (CogMesh) indicate great flexibility to improve the spectrum utilization by opportunistically accessing the authorized frequency bands.

Simulations are used to verify the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness of improving the energy efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615246/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11628395","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615246/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Green transmit power assignment for cognitive radio networks by applying multi-agent Q-learning approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green transmit power assignment for cognitive radio networks by applying multi-agent Q-learning approach","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046794S","chronDate":"27-28 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606053","isNumber":"5615105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606053","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5615105","articleId":"5615246","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5615248,"authors":[{"name":"Victor Echeverr\u00eda","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, New Mexico Tech Socorro, Socorro, New Mexico, USA"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Echeverr\u00eda","id":"37594092800"},{"name":"Lorie M.

Since the physical location of user data in the cloud is unknown and the data are often distributed across multiple cloud services, a user controllable and privacy preserving access control mechanism is necessary for the success of cloud computing in general and for the protection of user data in specific. In this paper, we discuss a novel approach to controlling access to user data in the cloud; the concept is called Permission as a Service (PaaS). Specifically, PaaS separates access control from other services to provide a separate service in the cloud. This allows users to set permissions for all data in a single location. In PaaS, user data are encrypted to maintain confidentiality and permissions are managed via decryption keys. As a proof-of-concept, we discuss the design and implementation of our prototype leveraging attribute based encryption (ABE).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Permission Management System: Permission as a Service in Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 34th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","doi":"10.1109/COMPSACW.2010.71","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 34th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613986/5614033/05615248.pdf","startPage":"371","endPage":"375","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSACW.2010.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614033","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Permission Management System: Permission as a Service in Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615248/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11636132","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Permission Management System: Permission as a Service in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4105a371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052379S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613986","isNumber":"5614033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613986","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5614033","articleId":"5615248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5615270,"authors":[{"name":"Yeh-Tai Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yeh-Tai","lastName":"Hung","id":"37589226000"},{"name":"Shang-Ho Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shang-Ho","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37279553800"},{"name":"Yen-Chang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yen-Chang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37600601100"},{"name":"Zhe-Yang Huang","affiliation":["ITRI, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zhe-Yang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37575786400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5305-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5306-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"5615270","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":347},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","CMOS integrated circuits","Wideband","Impedance matching","Noise","MOS devices","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers","microwave amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band switchable low noise amplifier","band switchable LNA","input matching circuit","cascode common source amplifiers","switching capacitors","NMOS","CMOS technology","TSMC","frequency 3.25 GHz to 5.6 GHz","frequency 6 GHz to 10.4 GHz","gain 3.1 dB to 6.5 dB","gain 10.8 dB","gain 16.8 dB","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LNA","low noise amplifier","band switchable","switching capacitors","CMOS","RF"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615270","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2010.5615270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2010.5615270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614039","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606680/5614039/05615270.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.18\u00b5m 3.25\u20135.6GHz and 6\u201310.4GHz band switchable low noise amplifier","abstract":"One band switchable low noise amplifier (LNA) is designed for wideband applications.

OFCA employs a lineal clustering to group tasks into clusters, and utilizes an efficient heuristic task mapping process to allocate ready clusters onto the platform. Then a low latency pipeline-based static task scheduling stage is proposed to arrange task sequence in IP cores. Finally a best hardware resource demand for the application could be predicted for reference. OFCA can fully exploit the parallel characteristics within task graphs to minimize inter-cluster communication and limit copying tasks when clustering to reduce extra execution energy. It also controls the use of task-duplication-technique (TDT) by setting different parameters for flexible goals to make a compromise between energy and latency. Experiments show that objectives can be adjusted via different parameter ratios performing OFCA and 57% energy savings on average can be achieved compared to CM Algorithm when employed to streaming applications of 18, 36, and 40 tasks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615262","publicationTitle":"2010 Academic Symposium on Optoelectronics and Microelectronics Technology and 10th Chinese-Russian Symposium on Laser Physics and Laser TechnologyOptoelectronics Technology (ASOT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Academic Symposium on Optoelectronics and Microelectronics Technology and 10th Chinese-Russian Symposium on Laser Physics and Laser TechnologyOptoelectronics Technology (ASOT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605055/5615262/05615317.pdf","doi":"10.1109/RCSLPLT.2010.5615317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RCSLPLT.2010.5615317","startPage":"369","endPage":"373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Objective-Flexible Clustering Algorithm for task mapping and scheduling on cluster-based NoC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 28 2010-Aug. 1 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615317/","displayDocTitle":"An Objective-Flexible Clustering Algorithm for task mapping and scheduling on cluster-based NoC","htmlLink":"/document/5615317/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 July-1 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11627428","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Objective-Flexible Clustering Algorithm for task mapping and scheduling on cluster-based NoC","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"6009FuFangfa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05985S","chronDate":"July 28 2010-Aug. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605055","isNumber":"5615262","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605055","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5615262","articleId":"5615317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5615367,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406557100"},{"name":"Xia Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37396189700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5305-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5306-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"5615367","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tumors","Time domain analysis","Microwave imaging","Breast cancer","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cancer","finite difference time-domain analysis","image reconstruction","microwave imaging","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra wideband","image reconstruction","FDTD","PML","boundary condition","breast cancer detection","finite difference time domain method","perfectly matched layer","malignant tumor","microwave imaging","antenna array"]}],"abstract":"A study of the Ultra-Wideband (UWB) microwave imaging via the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) with perfectly matched layer absorption boundary condition (PML ABC) for detecting the early malignant tumor in the human breast is presented.

In the time domain, the characteristics of an ultra wideband impulse radio antenna array are depicted and analyzed in this paper.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2010.5615376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614039","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606680/5614039/05615376.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near and farfield analysis of ultra wideband impulse radio beamforming in the time domain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615376/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5615376/","displayDocTitle":"Near and farfield analysis of ultra wideband impulse radio beamforming in the time domain","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11629134","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near and farfield analysis of ultra wideband impulse radio beamforming in the time domain","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"E4020139331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052574S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606680","isNumber":"5614039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606680","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5614039","articleId":"5615376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5615394,"authors":[{"name":"Iza Sazanita Isa","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Pulau Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Iza Sazanita","lastName":"Isa","id":"37847920100"},{"name":"Saodah Omar","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Pulau Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Saodah","lastName":"Omar","id":"37605302100"},{"name":"Zuraidi Saad","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Pulau Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zuraidi","lastName":"Saad","id":"37320620200"},{"name":"Norhayati Mohamad Noor","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Pulau Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Norhayati Mohamad","lastName":"Noor","id":"37063478800"},{"name":"Muhammad Khusairi Osman","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Pulau Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Muhammad Khusairi","lastName":"Osman","id":"37272132700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7837-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4158-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5615394","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":520},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Weather forecasting","Training","Forecasting","Feeds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysics computing","multilayer perceptrons","photovoltaic power systems","weather forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weather forecasting","photovoltaic system","artificial neural network","multiple multilayer perceptron","majority voting technique","Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm","majority rules technique","decision making technique","consensus democracy technique","consensus government technique","supermajority technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forecasting","MMLP Neural Network","photovoltaic system","voting technique."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615394","abstract":"This paper presents the applicability of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for weather forecasting using a Photovoltaic system. The main objective is to predict daily weather conditions based on various measured parameters gained from the PV system. In this work, Multiple Multilayer Perceptron (MMLP) network with majority voting technique was used and trained using Levenberg Marquardt (LM) algorithm. Voting technique is widely used in many applications to solve real world problem. Different techniques of voting are used such as majority rules, decision making, consensus democracy, consensus government and supermajority. The way of the voting technique is different depending on the problem involved. Majority voting technique was applied in the study so that the performance of MMLP can be approved as compared to single MLP network. The proposed work has been used to classify four weather conditions; rain, cloudy, dry day and storm. The system can be used to represent a warning system for likely adverse conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the applied technique gives better performance than the conventional ANN concept of choosing an MLP with least number of hidden neurons.","doi":"10.1109/CICSyN.2010.63","startPage":"96","endPage":"100","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICSyN.2010.63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614044","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613973/5614044/05615394.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weather Forecasting Using Photovoltaic System and Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615394/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Weather Forecasting Using Photovoltaic System and Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615394/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11626720","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weather Forecasting Using Photovoltaic System and Neural Network","confLoc":"Liverpool, UK","sourcePdf":"4158a096.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072377S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613973","isNumber":"5614044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613973","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5614044","articleId":"5615394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5615400,"authors":[{"name":"Mohd Ibrahim Shapiai","affiliation":["Centre of Artificial Intelligent and Robotics (CAIRO), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mohd Ibrahim","lastName":"Shapiai","id":"38558359400"},{"name":"Zuwairie Ibrahim","affiliation":["Centre of Artificial Intelligent and Robotics (CAIRO), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Zuwairie","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37303868100"},{"name":"Marzuki Khalid","affiliation":["Centre of Artificial Intelligent and Robotics (CAIRO), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Marzuki","lastName":"Khalid","id":"37298288700"},{"name":"Lee Wen Jau","affiliation":["ATTD Automation (APAC) Pathfinding, Intel Technology Malaysia Sdn.

Function approximation algorithms normally require sufficient amount of samples to approximate a function. However, insufficient samples may result in unsatisfactory prediction to any function approximation algorithms. It is due to the failure of the function approximation algorithms to fill the information gap between the available and very limited samples. In this study, a function approximation algorithm which is based on Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Regression (NWKR) is proposed for approximating a non-linear function with small samples. Gaussian function is chosen as a kernel function for this study. The results show that the NWKR is effective in the case where the target function is non-linear and the given training sample is small. The performance of the NWKR is compared with other existing function approximation algorithms, such as artificial neural network.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Function approximation","Kernel","Training","Approximation algorithms","Artificial neural networks","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["function approximation","nonlinear functions","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear function approximation algorithm","Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression","Gaussian function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression","small samples","artificial samples","non-linear function","neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CICSyN.2010.10","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613973/5614044/05615400.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICSyN.2010.10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Non-linear Function Approximation from Small Samples Based on Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Regression","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615400","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Non-linear Function Approximation from Small Samples Based on Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Regression","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615400/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615400/","accessionNumber":"11626721","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Non-linear Function Approximation from Small Samples Based on Nadaraya-Watson Kernel Regression","confLoc":"Liverpool, UK","sourcePdf":"4158a028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046635S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613973","isNumber":"5614044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613973","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5614044","articleId":"5615400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5615433,"authors":[{"name":"Ozgur Tasdizen","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ozgur","lastName":"Tasdizen","id":"37593523600"},{"name":"Ilker Hamzaoglu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ilker","lastName":"Hamzaoglu","id":"37295957400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7839-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5615433","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering","Correlation","Hardware","Computational complexity","Registers","Clocks","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","field programmable gate arrays","median filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector median filtering","frame rate up-conversion","computational complexity","Xilinx XC3S400A-5 FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["vector median filter","frame rate conversion","computation reduction","hardware implementation"]}],"abstract":"Vector Median Filters (VMFs) are used in many image and video processing applications.

These solutions achieve very high throughput but at very high cost of hardware resources, making them impractical in real applications. In this paper, we present a novel four-nodes-per-cycle parallel architecture of FSD, with a breadth-first processing that allows for short critical path.

Also when the training sequence length is longer than the steady state length of existing algorithms, the BER performance of the proposed algorithm can be improved by increasing the training sequence length which can't be achieved by existing algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615452/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5615452/","accessionNumber":"11629147","displayDocTitle":"Improved NLMS based MMSE adaptive detection algorithm for IR-UWB systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved NLMS based MMSE adaptive detection algorithm for IR-UWB systems","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"E3030438611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070233S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606680","isNumber":"5614039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606680","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5614039","articleId":"5615452","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5615527,"authors":[{"name":"Florent Berthelot","affiliation":["Bretagne Atlantique, INRIA Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Florent","lastName":"Berthelot","id":"37428390200"},{"name":"Francois Charot","affiliation":["Bretagne Atlantique, INRIA Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Charot","id":"37269311900"},{"name":"Charles Wagner","affiliation":["IRISA/CNRS UMR 6074, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Wagner","id":"37273711800"},{"name":"Christophe Wolinski","affiliation":["IRISA, University of Rennes I, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Wolinski","id":"37265513900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7839-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5615527","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615527","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital video broadcasting","Decoding","Approximation algorithms","Throughput","Approximation methods","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","digital video broadcasting","forward error correction","parity check codes","telecommunication standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DVB-S2 decoder","Digital Video Broadcasting Satellite","capacity gains","forward error correction","FEC","LDPC code","BCH codes","bit error rate","BER","DVBS2FEC decoder","message quantizations","FOMS algorithm approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Forward Error Correction","LDPC","check node approximation","architecture for DVB-S2 decoding"]}],"abstract":"The new Digital Video Broadcasting Satellite (DVB-S2) standard is able to provide capacity gains of about 30% over the previous standard by using a powerfull Forward Error Correction (FEC) scheme based on very large LDPC code words and BCH codes.

The designer must deal with the overall design complexity and the decoding throughput in order to obtain a high decoding performance in terms of bit error rate (BER). We present in detail a complete design flow allowing a better understanding of the algorithm in terms of complexity, performance and its hardware implementation. We focus on complexity-performance trade-offs due to message quantizations and we compare its effects on several algorithm corrections used to check nodes for DVB-S2 decoding. The simulation results show that the best compromise between complexity and performance is obtained for the FOMS algorithm approximation.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2010.40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2010.40","startPage":"667","endPage":"674","publicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613535/5615428/05615527.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Methodology for a High Performance Robust DVB-S2 Decoder Implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615527/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design Methodology for a High Performance Robust DVB-S2 Decoder Implementation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11626585","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5615527/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Methodology for a High Performance Robust DVB-S2 Decoder Implementation","confLoc":"Lille, France","sourcePdf":"4171a667.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110705S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613535","isNumber":"5615428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613535","xplore-issue":"5615428","articleId":"5615527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5615529,"authors":[{"name":"Zden\u011bk Kot\u00e1sek","affiliation":["Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zden\u011bk","lastName":"Kot\u00e1sek","id":"37378056100"},{"name":"Jaroslav \u0160karvada","affiliation":["Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jaroslav","lastName":"\u0160karvada","id":"37712245200"},{"name":"Josef Strnadel","affiliation":["Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Josef","lastName":"Strnadel","id":"37712263600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7839-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5615529","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615529","abstract":"In most of existing approaches, the reorganization of test vector sequence and reordering scan chains registers to reduce power consumption are solved separately, they are seen as independent procedures. In the paper it is shown that a correlation between these two processes and strong reasons to combine them into one procedure run concurrently exist. Based on this idea, it is demonstrated that search spaces of both procedures can be combined together into a single search space in order to achieve better results during the optimization process. The optimization over the united search space was tested on ISCAS85, ISCAS89 and ITC99 benchmark circuits implemented by means of CMOS primitives from AMI technological libraries. Results presented in the paper show that lower power consumption can be achieved if the correlation is reflected, i.e., if the search space is united rather than divided into separate spaces.

Many hardware compilation tools support a fixed recipe of applying design transformations, but designers have few options to adapt the recipe without re-writing the tools themselves. In addition, complex transformations based on linear programming and geometric programming are often not included. This paper proposes anew approach that enables designers to customize the composition and parameterization of different types of design transformations in a unified framework, using a high-level language to control a transformation engine to automate the application of design transformations. Our approach is implemented by a tool based on the Python language and the ROSE compiler framework, which supports both syntax-directed transformations such as loop coalescing, and goal-directed transformations such as geometric programming. We illustrate how customizing the composition and parameterization of design transformations can lead to designs with different trade-offs in performance, resource usage, and energy efficiency. We evaluate our approach on benchmarks including matrix multiplication, Monte Carlo simulation of Asian options, edge detection, FIR filtering, and motion estimation.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2010.78","publicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613535/5615428/05615538.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2010.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615428","startPage":"595","endPage":"602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Customizable Composition and Parameterization of Hardware Design Transformations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Customizable Composition and Parameterization of Hardware Design Transformations","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615538/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11626592","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5615538/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Customizable Composition and Parameterization of Hardware Design Transformations","confLoc":"Lille, France","sourcePdf":"4171a595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084833S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613535","isNumber":"5615428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613535","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5615428","articleId":"5615538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5615545,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Roudel","affiliation":["UMR 6602 CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal, Aubiere, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Roudel","id":"37594472200"},{"name":"Francois Berry","affiliation":["UMR 6602 CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal, Aubiere, France"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Berry","id":"37339685500"},{"name":"Jocelyn Serot","affiliation":["UMR 6602 CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Blaise Pascal, Aubiere, France"],"firstName":"Jocelyn","lastName":"Serot","id":"37594468700"},{"name":"Laurent Eck","affiliation":["CEA LIST, Fontenay-aux-roses, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Eck","id":"37546389200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7839-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5615545","dbTime":"55 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Registers","Driver circuits","Smart cameras","Computer architecture","Hardware design languages","Field programmable gate arrays","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","computer vision","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-level methodology","FPGA-based smart camera","field programmable gate array","vision applications","soft-core approach","dataflow language","VHDL language"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Soft-core","methodology","smart camera","heterogeneous platforms","CAL","processing elements"]}],"abstract":"Due to the various devices composing a smart camera system, various languages have to be known by the designer (like HDL and C/C++).

This paper describes a methodology of FPGA testing that does not require reconfiguration of the tested hardware and thus it preserves conditions that caused erroneous behavior of the FPGA during its function. We show that the tested part of the FPGA can be efficiently tested by deterministic test patters even in case if we have no precise information about the internal FPGA structure. It is too hardware consuming to store uncompressed deterministic test patterns on the FPGA. From this reason we propose to compress the deterministic test patterns with the help of COMPAS - a compression system that uses scan chains for pattern decompression. COMPAS is well suited for current FPGAs as they can store the scan chain content in the LUT based shift registers. The COMPAS test compression system is based on test pattern overlapping, we propose an improved version of it. Application of overlapped test patterns requires additional shift registers for saving test patterns during test response recording into the internal scan chains. The neighborhood of the tested part of the FPGA can be dynamically reconfigured into shift registers and ORA. The shift registers contain compressed test sequence and allow fast test pattern decompression. Experimental results given in the paper demonstrate efficiency of the proposed FPGA testing method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11626603","htmlLink":"/document/5615554/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application Dependent FPGA Testing Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application Dependent FPGA Testing Method","confLoc":"Lille, France","sourcePdf":"4171a525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079497S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613535","isNumber":"5615428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613535","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5615428","articleId":"5615554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5615555,"authors":[{"name":"Yijun Zhou","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yijun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37332257700"},{"name":"Michael Yan-Wah Chia","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Michael Yan-Wah","lastName":"Chia","id":"37278714100"},{"name":"Chiew Kok Ang","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chiew Kok","lastName":"Ang","id":"37593491800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5305-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5306-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"5615555","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":427},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615555","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Transistors","Impedance","Radio frequency","Power transmission lines","Multiaccess communication","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outphasing power amplifier","LDMOS transistor","distributed active transformer","high efficiency impedance transformation","lossless power combining","current mode class D amplification technique","outphasing signal","wideband code division multiple access signal","continuous wave signal","frequency 900 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power amplifier","power combiner","transformer","outphasing","current mode class-D amplifier","WCDMA"]}],"abstract":"A novel 900 MHz outphasing power amplifier using LDMOS transistors has been developed.

By transforming the NLFSR of Grain from its original Fibonacci configuration to the Galois configuration and by introducing new hardware solutions, we double the throughput of the 80 and 128-bit key 1 bit/cycle architectures of Grain with no area and power penalty.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613535/5615428/05615568.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"440","publicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2010.49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2010.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615428","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Hardware Implementation of the Grain Stream Cipher","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Shift registers","Delay","Throughput","Indexes","Hardware","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","random sequences","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grain stream cipher","pseudorandom bit sequence","nonlinear feedback shift register","Fibonacci configuration","Galois configuration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grain","Stream Ciphers","Galois","NLFSR","Hardware Implementation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Hardware Implementation of the Grain Stream Cipher","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615568/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11626610","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Hardware Implementation of the Grain Stream Cipher","confLoc":"Lille, France","sourcePdf":"4171a433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062142S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613535","isNumber":"5615428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613535","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5615428","articleId":"5615568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5615572,"authors":[{"name":"Somsubhra Talapatra","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Somsubhra","lastName":"Talapatra","id":"37541629800"},{"name":"Hafizur Rahaman","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Hafizur","lastName":"Rahaman","id":"37284440200"},{"name":"Samir K.

A generic controller for driving dynamic reconfiguration process of faulty unit is demonstrated and analyzed. Parameters of the generic partial reconfiguration controller are experimentally verified. The developed controller is compared with other approaches based on micro controllers inside FPGA. A structure which can be used in fault tolerant system design into SRAM-based FPGA using partial reconfiguration controller is then described.

A full FPGA prototype was developed and evaluated using Virtex-4 devices, including over-the-air testing in the 2.05 GHz radio band.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Layer for Spectrum-Aware Reconfigurable OFDM on an FPGA","publicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2010.110","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613535/5615428/05615596.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2010.110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615428","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Physical Layer for Spectrum-Aware Reconfigurable OFDM on an FPGA","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615596/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11626631","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Layer for Spectrum-Aware Reconfigurable OFDM on an FPGA","confLoc":"Lille, France","sourcePdf":"4171a321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053902S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613535","isNumber":"5615428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613535","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5615428","articleId":"5615596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5615597,"authors":[{"name":"Joakim \u00d6sth","affiliation":["Department of Science and Technology ITN, Link\u00f6ping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Joakim","lastName":"\u00d6sth","id":"37396651900"},{"name":"Adriana Serban","affiliation":["Department of Science and Technology ITN, Link\u00f6ping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Adriana","lastName":"Serban","id":"37282181300"},{"name":"Owais","affiliation":["Link\u00f6ping University, Department of Science and Technology ITN, Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"lastName":"Owais"},{"name":"Magnus Karlsson","affiliation":["Department of Science and Technology ITN, Link\u00f6ping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Magnus","lastName":"Karlsson","id":"37267658000"},{"name":"Shaofang Gong","affiliation":["Department of Science and Technology ITN, Link\u00f6ping University, Norrkoping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Shaofang","lastName":"Gong","id":"37269431900"},{"name":"Jaap Haartsen","affiliation":["Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jaap","lastName":"Haartsen","id":"37296271300"},{"name":"Peter Karlsson","affiliation":["Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Karlsson","id":"37594058800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5305-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5306-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"5615597","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":311},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Schottky diodes","Baseband","Correlators","Demodulation","Harmonic analysis","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","demodulators","diodes","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diode configuration","six-port receiver","amplifier","filter","six-port based demodulator","full-wave rectification","odd-order harmonics","demodulator prototype","six-port correlator","baseband data","frequency 7.5 GHz","bandwidth 1 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["six-port correlator","demodulator","diode configuration"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diode configurations in six-port receivers with simplified interface to amplifier and filter","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2010.5615597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614060","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606680/5614060/05615597.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2010.5615597","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615597","abstract":"This paper presents two new diode configurations for use with six-port based demodulators.

Today, digital hardware has become powerful enough to perform the massive number of operations required for real-time digital beam forming. While more and more applications are using beam forming to improve the communication channel utilization both in space and frequency, many dedicated digital architectures are proposed for the processing. By using a reconfigurable architecture, the same hardware platform can be reused for different applications with different processing needs. In this paper, we present a reconfigurable Multi-processor System-on-Chip based solution for phased array processing that supports advanced tracking mechanisms to continuously receive signals with a mobile receiver. An adaptive beam former for DVB-S satellite reception is presented, that uses a Constant Modulus Algorithm to track satellites. The processing of a receiver with 64 antennas and 3 beams is mapped on a reconfigurable processor named Montium TP. The total implementation of such a receiver requires about 570 clock cycles on a single Montium TP, but can also be partitioned over multiple Montium TPs to support larger phased arrays.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2010.13","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613535/5615428/05615598.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2010.13","publicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","startPage":"301","endPage":"308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Beamforming Using the Reconfigurable MONTIUM TP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Beamforming Using the Reconfigurable MONTIUM TP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615598/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615598/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11626632","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Beamforming Using the Reconfigurable MONTIUM TP","confLoc":"Lille, France","sourcePdf":"4171a301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063627S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613535","isNumber":"5615428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613535","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5615428","articleId":"5615598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5615607,"authors":[{"name":"Son Truong Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan","Department of Computer Science, Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Son Truong","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38255115400"},{"name":"Shigeru Oyanagi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan","Department of Computer Science, Ritsumeikan University, Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan"],"firstName":"Shigeru","lastName":"Oyanagi","id":"37295896200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7839-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5615607","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":332},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Switches","Resource management","Routing","Pipelines","Hardware","System-on-a-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","network-on-chip","pipeline processing","queueing theory","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-cycle router","virtual output queuing","network-on-chip","communication latency","NoC latency","VOQ","packet transfer","FPGA","two-dimensional mesh network"]}],"abstract":"The communication latency of Network-on-Chip (NoC) is one of the factors that significantly impacts on the application performance on System-on-Chips. To reduce the NoC latency, we propose a low latency architecture of router, which utilizes virtual output queuing (VOQ) to shorten the processing time of a packet transfer. Based on taking advantage of VOQ in buffering, the number of pipeline stages of a packet transfer can be reduced to two stages of switch allocation and switch traversal. By speculatively implementing these stages in a parallel fashion, the router can perform a packet transfer in only one clock cycle. In addition, a multiple VOQ architecture that each input port maintains more than one queue for each output channel is also proposed for improving the throughput of router. We have implemented the proposed router on FPGA and evaluated in terms of communication latency, throughput and hardware amount. The experimental results show that in a 4 \u00d7 4 two-dimensional mesh network, the proposed router reduces the communication latency by 25% and cost of area by 67.3% as compared to the look-ahead speculative virtual channel router.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Cost Single-Cycle Router Based on Virtual Output Queuing for On-chip Networks","publicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2010.15","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613535/5615428/05615607.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2010.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615428","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Low Cost Single-Cycle Router Based on Virtual Output Queuing for On-chip Networks","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615607/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11626638","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Cost Single-Cycle Router Based on Virtual Output Queuing for On-chip Networks","confLoc":"Lille, France","sourcePdf":"4171a060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065174S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613535","isNumber":"5615428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613535","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5615428","articleId":"5615607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5615614,"authors":[{"name":"Levent Aksoy","affiliation":["INESC ID, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Levent","lastName":"Aksoy","id":"37594772400"},{"name":"Eduardo Costa","affiliation":["Universidade Cat\u00f3lica de Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Costa","id":"37276140200"},{"name":"Paulo Flores","affiliation":["INESC ID/IST-TU Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Flores","id":"37368953600"},{"name":"Jose Monteiro","affiliation":["INESC ID/IST-TU Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Monteiro","id":"37270010900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7839-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5615614","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Delay","Logic gates","Optimization","Heuristic algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Adders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","logic design","logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area optimization","delay optimization","multiple constant multiplications","addition operation","subtraction operation","MCM design","delay constraint","gate-level optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple constant multiplications","addition and subtraction architectures","gate-level area optimization","delay aware area optimization","graph-based algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DSD.2010.32","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615614","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2010.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615428","publicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613535/5615428/05615614.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Area and Delay at Gate-Level in Multiple Constant Multiplications","abstract":"Although many efficient high-level algorithms have been proposed for the realization of Multiple Constant Multiplications (MCM) using the fewest number of addition and subtraction operations, they do not consider the low-level implementation issues that directly affect the area, delay, and power dissipation of the MCM design.

On one hand, these systems often target mass production and battery-based devices, and therefore should be cheap and power efficient. On the other hand, they need to achieve high (real-time) performance. This wide spectrum of design requirements leads to complex heterogeneous system-on-chip (SoC) architectures. The complexity of embedded systems forces designers to model and simulate systems and their components to explore the wide range of design choices. Such design space exploration is especially needed during the early design stages, where the design space is at its largest. Due to the exponential design space in real problems and multiple criteria to be considered, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are often used to trim down a large design space into a finite set of points and provide the designer a set of tradable solutions with respect to the design criteria. Interpreting the search results (e.g., where are the Pareto points located), understanding their relations and analyzing how the design space was searched by such searching algorithms is of invaluable importance to the designer. To this end, this paper presents a novel interactive visualization tool, based on tree visualization, to understand the search dynamics of a MOEA and to visualize where the optimum design points are located in the design space and what objective values they have.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2010.75","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613535/5615428/05615616.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"20","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","publicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2010.75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visualization of Multi-objective Design Space Exploration for Embedded Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Visualization of Multi-objective Design Space Exploration for Embedded Systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11626644","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5615616/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visualization of Multi-objective Design Space Exploration for Embedded Systems","confLoc":"Lille, France","sourcePdf":"4171a011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068222S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613535","isNumber":"5615428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613535","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5615428","articleId":"5615616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5615635,"authors":[{"name":"Ruben Salvador","affiliation":["Centre of Industrial Electronics, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"Salvador","id":"37297703300"},{"name":"Felix Moreno","affiliation":["Centre of Industrial Electronics, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Moreno","id":"37297702300"},{"name":"Teresa Riesgo","affiliation":["Centre of Industrial Electronics, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Teresa","lastName":"Riesgo","id":"37283653200"},{"name":"Lukas Sekanina","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Lukas","lastName":"Sekanina","id":"37435622400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7839-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5615635","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Multiresolution analysis","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","field programmable gate arrays","image coding","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high level validation","optimization algorithm","adaptive wavelet transform","FPGA","image compression","embedded system","evolutionary algorithm","system-on-chip","fixed point arithmetic"]}],"abstract":"The work reported in this paper describes the steps given towards an FPGA-based implementation of evolvable wavelet transforms for image compression in embedded systems.

In MTT algorithms, implemented in embedded systems, it is important to use the minimum required resources to allow the entire DAS system to be integrated on the same chip (data acquisition, MTT and alarm restitution). This allows the reduction of the System on Chip (SoC) complexity and cost. This paper presents an efficient Driver Assistance System (DAS) based on MTT application. To do so, we first identified the performance bottlenecks in the application. In this application, a set of optimizations were applied to reduce the MTT algorithm's complexity. Tuning in conjunction the hardware and the software yielded to optimize the final system and to meet the functional requirements. The result is a complete embedded MTT application running on an embedded system that fits in a contemporary medium sized FPGA device.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2010.54","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613535/5615428/05615646.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2010.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615428","publicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","startPage":"255","endPage":"258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Automotive Multiple Target Tracking System Design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615646/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11626659","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615646/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Automotive Multiple Target Tracking System Design","confLoc":"Lille, France","sourcePdf":"4171a255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0481S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613535","isNumber":"5615428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613535","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5615428","articleId":"5615646","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5615659,"authors":[{"name":"Saad Mubeen","affiliation":["M\u00e4lardalen Real-Time Research Centre, Vasteras, Sweden","Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Saad","lastName":"Mubeen","id":"38342827700"},{"name":"Shashi Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Shashi","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37290706700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7839-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5615659","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":743},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Algorithm design and analysis","Topology","Network topology","Encoding","System-on-a-chip","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","network routing","network topology","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source routing algorithm","mesh topology","network-on-chip platform","on-chip communication","multicore chip","deadlock free routing algorithm","link load balancing","distributed routing","generic simulator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network on Chip (NoC)","Distributed Routing","Source Routing","Routing Algorithms","Performance Analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615659","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2010.57","publicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","abstract":"Efficient on-chip communication is very important for exploiting enormous computing power available on a multi-core chip. Network on Chip (NoC) has emerged as a competitive candidate for implementing on-chip communication. Routing algorithms significantly affect the performance of a NoC. Most of the existing NoC architectural proposals advocate distributed routing algorithms for building NoC platforms. Although source routing offers many advantages, researchers avoided it due to its apparent disadvantage of larger header size requirement that results in lower bandwidth utilization. In this paper we make a strong case for the use of source routing for NoCs, especially for platforms with small sizes and regular topologies. We present a methodology to compute application specific efficient paths for communication among cores with a high degree of load balancing. The methodology first selects the most appropriate deadlock free routing algorithm, from a set of routing algorithms, based on the application's traffic patterns. Then the selected (possibly adaptive) routing algorithm is used to compute efficient static paths with the goal of link load balancing. We demonstrate through simulation based evaluation that source routing has a potential of achieving higher performance, for example up to 28% lower latency even at medium load, as compared to distributed routing. A simple scheme is proposed for encoding of router ports to reduce the header overhead. A generic simulator was developed for evaluation and performance comparison between source routing and distributed routing. We also designed a router to support source routing for mesh topology NoC platforms.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2010.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615428","startPage":"181","endPage":"188","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 13th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design: Architectures, Methods and Tools","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613535/5615428/05615659.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing Efficient Source Routing for Mesh Topology Network on Chip Platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5615659/","displayDocTitle":"Designing Efficient Source Routing for Mesh Topology Network on Chip Platforms","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11626667","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing Efficient Source Routing for Mesh Topology Network on Chip Platforms","confLoc":"Lille, France","sourcePdf":"4171a181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046074S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613535","isNumber":"5615428","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613535","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5615428","articleId":"5615659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5615660,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center of Manufacturing Research, Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Song","id":"37407142800"},{"name":"Nan Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center of Manufacturing Research, Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Guo","id":"37288909600"},{"name":"Zhen Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Center of Manufacturing Research, Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Hu","id":"37407148800"},{"name":"Robert C.

However, the area and speed penalty is rather high. In contrast to the state-of-the-art approaches, where simple (NAND, NOR, etc.) 2 input gates are used, we propose a synthesis method based on complex nodes, i.e., nodes implementing any function of an arbitrary number of inputs.

With the joint of PPM and PSM scheme, the data rate and the bandwidth efficiency can be fold increased.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615675/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"11629093","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615675/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The waveform design for dynamic spectrum access of CUWB with high bandwidth efficiency","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The waveform design for dynamic spectrum access of CUWB with high bandwidth efficiency","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"E1062147941.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050333S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606680","isNumber":"5614039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606680","xplore-issue":"5614039","articleId":"5615675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5615683,"authors":[{"name":"Yeonjune Jeong","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yeonjune","lastName":"Jeong","id":"38254229500"},{"name":"Ju Yong Lee","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ju Yong","lastName":"Lee","id":"38226580900"},{"name":"Min Young Chung","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Min Young","lastName":"Chung","id":"37877595500"},{"name":"Tae-Jin Lee","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae-Jin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37277273500"},{"name":"Hyunseung Choo","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunseung","lastName":"Choo","id":"37274523300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8434-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4235-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5615683","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":580},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cochannel interference","frequency allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocell frequency planning scheme","cellular networks","soft frequency reuse","indoor coverage","cochannel interference","frequency allocation","power ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["femtocell frequency planning","co-channel interference","soft frequency reuse"]}],"abstract":"Femtocell is an attractive solution for operators to overcome the indoor coverage problem and to offload the growing traffic within macro cells. However, when femtocells are deployed in the existing macro cell environments, co-channel interference (CCI) may occur between the macro cell and femtocells. This CCI severely degrades the performance of femtocell and macro cell. Therefore, we propose a femtocell frequency allocation method in the macro cell network based on soft frequency reuse (SFR) scheme in downlink. We investigate the performance of macro cell and femtocell according to the power ratio in SFR scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed femtocell deployment does not affect the performance of macro cell users.","doi":"10.1109/CyberC.2010.39","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613985/5615501/05615683.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CyberC.2010.39","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615501","startPage":"176","endPage":"180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtocell Frequency Planning Scheme in Cellular Networks Based on Soft Frequency Reuse","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615683","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Femtocell Frequency Planning Scheme in Cellular Networks Based on Soft Frequency Reuse","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615683/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11626789","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5615683/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtocell Frequency Planning Scheme in Cellular Networks Based on Soft Frequency Reuse","confLoc":"Huangshan, China","sourcePdf":"4235a176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062559S","chronDate":"10-12 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613985","isNumber":"5615501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613985","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5615501","articleId":"5615683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5615693,"authors":[{"name":"O.

These interactions can violate a system's security policy, leading to unintended information flow. The physical portion of such systems is inherently observable, and, as such, many methods of preserving confidentiality are not applicable. This fundamental property of CPSs presents new security challenges. To illustrate this, a vehicle composed of an embedded computer system, its operator, and its environment show how information is disclosed to an observer that is watching from the outside. The example is made of up a vehicle with an automated engine management system (smart cruise control) traveling across some terrain with an observer watching the vehicle. The information that is to be protected is the controller of the vehicle. This model is analyzed using formal models of information flow, namely nondeducibility and noninference. The vehicle's operation, in context with the terrain of the road, discloses information to the observer. Context is important; the same information that was disclosed with one terrain type is hidden with a different terrain. This problem, its methodology, and results uncover problems, and solutions, based on the theory of information flow, to quantify security in these new types of systems.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","internal combustion engines","road vehicles","security of data","traffic information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environmental obfuscation","cyber physical system","embedded infrastructure","system security policy","embedded vehicle computer system","automated engine management system","smart cruise control","road vehicle","information flow"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Road Vehicles","Security","Information Flow"]}],"doi":"10.1109/COMPSACW.2010.39","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 34th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 34th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613986/5614033/05615779.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSACW.2010.39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Environmental Obfuscation of a Cyber Physical System - Vehicle Example","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Environmental Obfuscation of a Cyber Physical System - Vehicle Example","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615779/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615779/","accessionNumber":"11636156","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Environmental Obfuscation of a Cyber Physical System - Vehicle Example","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4105a176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050099S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613986","isNumber":"5614033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613986","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5614033","articleId":"5615779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5615789,"authors":[{"name":"Modjtaba Rouhani","affiliation":["Gonabad branch, Islamic Azad University, Gonabad, Iran"],"firstName":"Modjtaba","lastName":"Rouhani","id":"38558998900"},{"name":"Mohammad Rasoul Tanhatalab","affiliation":["Gonabad branch, Islamic Azad University, Gonabad, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Rasoul","lastName":"Tanhatalab","id":"37546200000"},{"name":"Ali Shokohi-Rostami","affiliation":["Gonabad branch, Islamic Azad University, Gonabad, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Shokohi-Rostami","id":"38558828700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7837-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4158-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5615789","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":365},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615789","abstract":"Active Queue Management (AQM) has been widely used for congestion avoidance in TCP networks.

Defect patterns can be widely used by programmers, static defect analysis tools, and even runtime verification. Following the idea of web 2.0, defect pattern repositories allow these users to submit defect patterns they found. However, submission of duplicate patterns would lead to a redundancy in the repository. This paper introduces an approach to suggest potential duplicates based on natural language processing. Our approach first computes field similarities based on Vector Space Model, and then employs Information Entropy to determine the field importance, and next combines the field similarities to form the final defect pattern similarity. Two strategies are introduced to make our approach adaptive to special situations. Finally, groups of duplicates are obtained by adopting Hierarchical Clustering.

The acquired results proved the superiority of the algorithm comparing with other pioneering techniques such as the MOPSO.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-objective Gravitational Search Algorithm","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","doi":"10.1109/CICSyN.2010.32","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Computational Intelligence, Communication Systems and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613973/5614044/05615810.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICSyN.2010.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614044","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-objective Gravitational Search Algorithm","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615810/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11626728","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-objective Gravitational Search Algorithm","confLoc":"Liverpool, UK","sourcePdf":"4158a007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055114S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613973","isNumber":"5614044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613973","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5614044","articleId":"5615810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":5615818,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto S.

They rely on the analysis of the impact of changes in source code artifacts, identifying corresponding parts of software to retest. While effective in minimizing the amount of testing required to validate code changes, they do not leverage on specification-level design and requirements concerns that motivated these changes. Model-based testing approaches support a top-down (or black box) testing approach, where design and requirements models are used in support of test generation. They augment code-based approaches with the ability to test from a higher-level design and requirements perspective. In this paper, we present a model-based regression testing and prioritization approach that efficiently selects test cases for regression testing based on different concerns. It relies on traceability links between models, test cases and code artifacts, together with user-defined properties associated to model elements. In particular we describe how to support concern-based regression testing and prioritization using TDE/UML, an extensible model-based testing environment.","doi":"10.1109/COMPSACW.2010.63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSACW.2010.63","startPage":"323","endPage":"328","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 34th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613986/5614033/05615818.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 34th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supporting Concern-Based Regression Testing and Prioritization in a Model-Driven Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Supporting Concern-Based Regression Testing and Prioritization in a Model-Driven Environment","conferenceDate":"19-23 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5615818/","accessionNumber":"11636182","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615818/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supporting Concern-Based Regression Testing and Prioritization in a Model-Driven Environment","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"4105a323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094743S","chronDate":"19-23 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613986","isNumber":"5614033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613986","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5614033","articleId":"5615818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5615870,"authors":[{"name":"Joao Rodrigues","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Joao","lastName":"Rodrigues","id":"37433699900"},{"name":"Antonio Nogueira","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Nogueira","id":"37413241100"},{"name":"Paulo Salvador","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Salvador","id":"37429195600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8150-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4185-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2156-7190"},{"format":"CD","value":"2156-7190"}],"articleNumber":"5615870","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":701},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network management","computer network security","IP networks","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network planning","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic prediction capability","neural networks","sliding window","multitask learning mechanisms","network services","global management","IP networks","network upgrading decisions","network functional operation","network link","global network traffic","network security","network management","network planning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network data prediction","neural networks","sliding window","multi-task learning","network emulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615870","abstract":"Due to the diversity of network services and the unpredictability of their behaviors, there is an increasing need for tools that can aid in the global management of IP networks. Being able to predict network data can be very useful to anticipate network upgrading decisions or changes on the network functional operation. This paper proposes a practical approach, based on neural networks, that is able to predict network traffic in a specific network link. In order to improve the prediction capabilities of the different neural network models, sliding window and multi-task learning mechanisms are introduced and tested. By applying this prediction framework to different network links, it will be possible to predict the evolution of the global network traffic and use this information for network security, management and planning purposes. The results obtained by applying the proposed model to realistic network scenarios show that this concept can achieve excellent performance in the prediction of the network traffic on the selected links. The prediction is accurate even when there are significant changes in the number of users and their respective profiles. Moreover, the proposed prediction approach is generic and can be used to predict different network data with a very satisfactory accuracy, even with simple and small NN models.","doi":"10.1109/INTERNET.2010.11","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613988/5615318/05615870.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Evolving Internet","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Evolving Internet","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTERNET.2010.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the Traffic Prediction Capability of Neural Networks Using Sliding Window and Multi-task Learning Mechanisms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615870/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Traffic Prediction Capability of Neural Networks Using Sliding Window and Multi-task Learning Mechanisms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11627148","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5615870/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Traffic Prediction Capability of Neural Networks Using Sliding Window and Multi-task Learning Mechanisms","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4185a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076959S","chronDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613988","isNumber":"5615318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613988","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5615318","articleId":"5615870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5615958,"authors":[{"name":"Behzad Biglarbegian","affiliation":["Intelligent Integrated Radio and Photonics Group and Center for Integrated RF Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Behzad","lastName":"Biglarbegian","id":"37542331700"},{"name":"Maher Bakri-Kassem","affiliation":["Intelligent Integrated Radio and Photonics Group and Center for Integrated RF Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Maher","lastName":"Bakri-Kassem","id":"38271952700"},{"name":"Raafat Mansour","affiliation":["Intelligent Integrated Radio and Photonics Group and Center for Integrated RF Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Raafat","lastName":"Mansour","id":"37275744800"},{"name":"Safieddin Safavi-Naeini","affiliation":["Intelligent Integrated Radio and Photonics Group and Center for Integrated RF Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Safieddin","lastName":"Safavi-Naeini","id":"38273790700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-016-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-2-87487-016-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5615958","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":460},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microswitches","phase shifters","planar antennas","reflector antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MEMS-based reflective-type phase shifter","millimeter-wave communication system","shunt switches","MEMS technology","hybrid broadside coupler","reflective load","transmission lines","average insertion loss","planar antenna","phased array system"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MEMS-based reflective-type phase-shifter for emerging millimeter-wave communication systems","doi":"10.23919/EUMC.2010.5615958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614756","endPage":"1559","publicationTitle":"The 40th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 40th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606055/5614756/05615958.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUMC.2010.5615958","startPage":"1556","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615958","abstract":"In this paper a 3-bit reflective-type phase shifter with shunt switches using MEMS technology is implemented.

These planar monopoles become popular for wireless communication due to their broad bandwidth and appropriate radiation pattern. However because of the dependence of the antenna gain and the antenna aperture, as the frequency increase, the wavelength decreases, the boresight gain decreases and its variation is very large. In this paper, a new UWB elliptical monopole antenna with a printed structure fed by a microstrip line is presented. The antenna is analyzed by using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method and the parameters of the shape of the antenna are determined by utilizing the genetic algorithm (GA). Through a novel ground structure of the substrate, the boresight gain equals to approximately 2.4dB in the frequency band ranges from 3GHz to 9GHz.

This suggests that UWB pulse technology is indeed feasible for real tumour detection and MIMO beamforming has the potential to produce accurate tumour images with acceptable resolution.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606680/5614039/05615972.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2010.5615972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2010.5615972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614039","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5615972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and experimental investigation of UWB microwave imaging via MIMO beamforming","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","microwave imaging","MIMO communication","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB microwave imaging","MIMO beamforming","multiple-input multiple-output","differential UWB antennas","pseudo-breast model","delay-and-sum beamformer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5615972/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design and experimental investigation of UWB microwave imaging via MIMO beamforming","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5615972/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11629153","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and experimental investigation of UWB microwave imaging via MIMO beamforming","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"D4033050611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045513S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606680","isNumber":"5614039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606680","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5614039","articleId":"5615972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5615996,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Cheng","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science & Engineering, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37366785700"},{"name":"Wen-jun Lu","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science & Engineering, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Wen-jun","lastName":"Lu","id":"37537000100"},{"name":"Chong-hu Cheng","affiliation":["College of Electronic Science & Engineering, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Chong-hu","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37290802700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5305-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5306-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"5615996","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":316},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip antennas","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["printed diversity antenna","ultra-wideband applications","elliptical shape monopoles","mutual coupling","UWB MIMO applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["diversity antenna","isolation","UWB","mutual couling"]}],"abstract":"A printed diversity antenna for Ultra-wideband applications is proposed.

The feedback loop is composed of auxiliary class-E amplifier to drive the second harmonic injection, filter to pass second harmonic, and delay line. This power amplifier presents improved PAE (power added efficiency) compared to that without the second harmonic feedback loop because second harmonic feedback loop assists the main amplifier working with conditions for ideal class-E operation. When second harmonic with proper magnitude and phase for ideal class-E conditions is injected to gate of the main amplifier, PAE is improved by 16% compared to that of the class-E amplifier without the second harmonic feedback. The measured maximum output power at the fundamental frequency shows 19.3 dBm, whereas the PAE shows 79 % with 3 dBm input power.

Using Taylor series with complex coefficients in RF amplifier modelling, both AM-AM and AM-PM distortions are considered. Finally, the function of output envelope versus input envelope is achieved. Simulations results represent that at best condition, the AM-AM and AM-PM characteristic are improved a little in spite of significant reduction of ACLR. Even, in some cases, the AM-AM characteristic of feedforward amplifier is worse than that of desired amplifier but ACLR becomes smaller. The loops imbalances affect the AM-AM characteristic strongly and their effects are calculated in our analysis.

The model has two segmented memory compensation elements for carrier PA correction at a low power and peaking PA correction at a high power. The validation of the proposed model in predicting a dynamic nonlinear behavior is carried out by comparing the output spectra, dynamic AM/AM and AM/PM characteristics, and the normalized mean square error.

Therefore, highly ranked web pages generally have higher visibility to people and pushing the ranking higher has become the top priority for webmasters. As a matter of fact, search engine optimization (SEO) has became a sizeable business that attempts to improve their clients' ranking. Still, the natural reluctance of search engine companies to reveal their internal mechanisms and the lack of ways to validate SEO's methods have created numerous myths and fallacies associated with ranking algorithms; Google'sin particular. In this paper, we focus on the Google ranking algorithm and design, implement, and evaluate a ranking system to systematically validate assumptions others have made about this popular ranking algorithm. We demonstrate that linear learning models, coupled with a recursive partitioning ranking scheme, are capable of reverse engineering Google's ranking algorithm with high accuracy. As an example, we manage to correctly predict 7 out of the top 10 pages for 78% of evaluated keywords. Moreover, for content-only ranking, our system can correctly predict 9 or more pages out of the top 10 ones for 77% of search terms. We show how our ranking system can be used to reveal the relative importance of ranking features in Google's ranking function, provide guidelines for SEOs and webmasters to optimize their web pages, validate or disapprove new ranking features, and evaluate search engine ranking results for possible ranking bias.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613987/5614551/05616194.pdf","startPage":"50","endPage":"57","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology","doi":"10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WI-IAT.2010.195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5616194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How to Improve Your Google Ranking: Myths and Reality","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Google ranking algorithm","Internet","Web pages","search engine optimization","SEO methods","linear learning models","recursive partitioning ranking scheme","reverse engineering","search engine ranking evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Google","Ranking Algorithm","Search Engine Evaluation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5616194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","displayDocTitle":"How to Improve Your Google Ranking: Myths and Reality","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5616194/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11636206","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-3 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How to Improve Your Google Ranking: Myths and Reality","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"4191a050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043722S","chronDate":"Aug. 31 2010-Sept. 3 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613987","isNumber":"5614551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613987","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5614551","articleId":"5616194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5616202,"authors":[{"name":"Kumar Narendra","affiliation":["Research & Development Center, Motorola Technology, Penang, Malaysia","Chair of Electromagnetic Theory, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Kumar","lastName":"Narendra","id":"37544845500"},{"name":"Ernesto Limiti","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Ernesto","lastName":"Limiti","id":"37266449600"},{"name":"Claudio Paoloni","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Paoloni","id":"37301257800"},{"name":"Juan-Mari Collantes","affiliation":["Electricity and Electronics Department, University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan-Mari","lastName":"Collantes","id":"37300042800"},{"name":"Rolf H.

Signal penetration into buildings induces severe attenuation which leads to poor indoor mobile coverage. Thus achieving adequate indoor signal to noise and interference ratio is challenging. If operators want to stimulate 3G usage as an alternative to the competitive WIFI solution, they will have to offer better data rates when users are at home or at work. The emerging femtocell solution may be the last step toward broadband mobile internet. Radio planning is not obvious for a plug-and-play femtocell device, which will inherently have an unpredictable deployment. In this paper we evaluate the performance that a femtocell system can achieve when coexisting with an overlaying macrocell system. We propose a double reuse frequency scheme for the assessment of the SINR at the femtocell level. We show that femtocells can definitely provide a meaningful improvement in the data rates experienced by the femtocell user equipment.","doi":"10.1109/INTERNET.2010.46","publicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Evolving Internet","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 2nd International Conference on Evolving Internet","pdfPath":"/iel5/5613988/5615318/05616269.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTERNET.2010.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5615318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtocell SINR Performance Evaluation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5616269","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5616269/","displayDocTitle":"Femtocell SINR Performance Evaluation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11627153","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5616269/","conferenceDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtocell SINR Performance Evaluation","confLoc":"Valencia, Spain","sourcePdf":"4185a229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06326S","chronDate":"20-25 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5613988","isNumber":"5615318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5613988","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5615318","articleId":"5616269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5616300,"authors":[{"name":"Werner L.

This method utilizes the mutual information (MI) between subsequent radar returns to extract desired information from the radar scene. With this approach, the radar system constantly learns about its surroundings and adopts its operational mode accordingly based upon the MI minimization criterion. Subsequently, the positioning algorithm makes use of this information about the radar scene to generate more accurate location estimates. Numerical results demonstrate an improvement in the probability of target detection even at low values of receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The proposed algorithm also promises a better delay-Doppler resolution of the target, which can be analyzed through the radar ambiguity function (AF).

The Doherty PA was designed to achieve high average efficiency for digitally modulated signals with high peak to average power ratio (PAR) used in third (3G) and fourth (4G) generation systems. To achieve constant efficiency up to 6 dB output power back-off (OPBO), a combined design technique of an uneven power divider and the use of unsymmetrical devices were employed. For demonstration, a 50 W Doherty PA was realized to operate at 2.5 GHz. A drain efficiency of 54 % (48 % power added efficiency (PAE)) was measured at the maximum output power of 47 dBm. The efficiency remains constant up to 6 dB output power back-off (OPBO).

The methodology is based on an algorithm that prevents the adverse effects due to undermodeling and overmodeling on the stability criteria. The automatic routine enables the use of pole-zero identification for multivariable large-signal stability analyses in which a large amount of individual identifications have to be performed and evaluated.

Traditional analog/RF radio architectures must often trade-off power efficiency (as in the case of power amplifiers) and/or board area, system cost and complexity to meet multi-standard performance requirements. Advances in digital signal processing capabilities and algorithms have now enabled digitally assisted RF radio systems to truly meet multi-standard performance requirements while providing unprecedented improvements in power efficiency and system cost as a whole. In this paper, we introduce an integrated transmit and receive digital signal processing solution which provides compensation for key RF system chain impairments such as linear/non-linear distortion, IQ imbalance, and DC offset/LO feedthrough. In addition, this chip provides a state of the art power amplifier linearization solution including crest factor reduction and digital pre-distortion for a variety of power amplifier topologies, including advanced Doherty and envelope tracking. This solution also includes digital up/down conversion, automatic gain control algorithms, solutions to support frequency hopping signals, and novel PA protection features, all in a compact 23\u00d723mm BGA ASSP, with under 4W of power consumption.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUMC.2010.5616529","publicationTitle":"The 40th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 40th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606055/5614756/05616529.pdf","startPage":"719","endPage":"722","doi":"10.23919/EUMC.2010.5616529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital signal processing solution for PA linearization and RF impairment correction for multi-standard wireless transceiver systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A digital signal processing solution for PA linearization and RF impairment correction for multi-standard wireless transceiver systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5616529/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11627887","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5616529/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital signal processing solution for PA linearization and RF impairment correction for multi-standard wireless transceiver systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1540.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055039S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606055","isNumber":"5614756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606055","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5614756","articleId":"5616529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5616537,"authors":[{"name":"S\u00e9bastien Chartier","affiliation":["T R Modules and MMICs, EADS Defense and Security, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"S\u00e9bastien","lastName":"Chartier","id":"37554644100"},{"name":"Peter Lohmiller","affiliation":["Institute of Electron Devices and Circuits, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Lohmiller","id":"38525985600"},{"name":"Jochen Dederer","affiliation":["T R Modules and MMICs, EADS Defense and Security, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Jochen","lastName":"Dederer","id":"37604267800"},{"name":"Hermann Schumacher","affiliation":["Institute of Electron Devices and Circuits, University of Ulm (EBS), Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Hermann","lastName":"Schumacher","id":"37266739100"},{"name":"Martin Oppermann","affiliation":["T R Modules and MMICs, EADS Defense and Security, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Oppermann","id":"37089136077"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-016-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-2-87487-016-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5616537","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":296},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5616537","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","BiCMOS integrated circuits","low noise amplifiers","microwave receivers","silicon compounds","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS wideband low noise amplifiers","BiCMOS technology","cascode topology","resistive shunt feedback","diode DC level shifter","worst case input reflexion coefficient","bondwire inductance","output reflexion coefficient","on-chip noise figure","LNA","supply voltage","integrated digital beam-forming receivers","size 0.25 mum","noise figure 2.5 dB to 2.9 dB","frequency 3 GHz to 11 GHz"]}],"doi":"10.23919/EUMC.2010.5616537","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606055/5614756/05616537.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 40th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 40th European Microwave Conference","startPage":"1070","endPage":"1073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUMC.2010.5616537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SiGe BiCMOS wideband Low Noise Amplifiers for application in Digital Beam-Forming Receivers","abstract":"In this paper, the authors present two wideband Low Noise Amplifiers using a 0.25 \u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS Technology.

Unfortunately, the first order model is not efficient enough, so a second application is presented, showing an accurate model expanded to Taylor second order in the case of large VSWR (VSWR > 3) which allows predicting circuit performances at system level and establishes a mixed simulation tool for a bilateral communication between amplifiers and antennas.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5616625/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11628304","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5616625/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Second order extension of power amplifiers behavioral models for accuracy improvements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second order extension of power amplifiers behavioral models for accuracy improvements","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"1788.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054653S","chronDate":"28-30 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606055","isNumber":"5614756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606055","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5614756","articleId":"5616625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EUROPEAN MICROWAVE ASSOC","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":5616627,"authors":[{"name":"Jangheon Kim","affiliation":["Telecommunication System Division Digital Media & Communication Business, Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Suwon, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jangheon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37281187400"},{"name":"Farouk Mkadem","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Farouk","lastName":"Mkadem","id":"37547039600"},{"name":"Slim Boumaiza","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Slim","lastName":"Boumaiza","id":"37283433900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-2-87487-016-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7232-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-2-87487-016-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5616627","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":765},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","gallium compounds","harmonic generation","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiband power amplifier","multimode power amplifier","distributed second harmonic termination","broadband saturated power amplifier","matching circuit","multiple second harmonic termination circuits","45 W Cree CGH40045 HEMT","drain efficiency","long term evolution","two carrier wideband code division multiple access","WCDMA band","PCS1900 band","DCS1800 band","digital predistortion linearization technique","power 45 W","frequency 2.3 GHz","GaN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5616627","doi":"10.23919/EUMC.2010.5616627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/EUMC.2010.5616627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614756","publicationTitle":"The 40th European Microwave Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"The 40th European Microwave Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606055/5614756/05616627.pdf","startPage":"1662","endPage":"1665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high efficiency and multi-band/multi-mode power amplifier using a distributed second harmonic termination","abstract":"This paper proposes a new broadband saturated power amplifier (SPA) with a distributed second harmonic termination supporting multi-band/multi-mode operation.

Furthermore, using the same setup we have been able to extract both the PA model and its inverse characteristic, leading directly to the design of a digital linearizer able to compensate effectively for the nonlinear memory effects. The linearizer has shown the capability to reduce significantly the spectral regrowth for different kinds of signals that differ fundamentally from the extraction stimulus.

Inverter output was controlled by the average solar irradiance over the previous 1h time interval. On a clear day the solar irradiance power curve is offset by about 1h, while on a variable cloudy day the inverter output power curve will be smoothed based on the average solar irradiance. Test results demonstrate that this smoothing algorithm works very well. Battery state of charge was more difficult to manage because of the variable system inefficiencies. Testing continued for 30-days and established consistent operational performance for extended periods of time under a wide variety of resource conditions. Both battery technologies from Exide (Absolyte) and East Penn (Advanced Valve Regulated Lead-Acid) proved to cycle well at a partial state of charge over the time interval tested.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2010.5616799","publicationTitle":"2010 35th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 35th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5604820/5614036/05616799.pdf","startPage":"002762","endPage":"002766","doi":"10.1109/PVSC.2010.5616799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grid-Tied PV system energy smoothing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Grid-Tied PV system energy smoothing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5616799/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11626064","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5616799/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grid-Tied PV system energy smoothing","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048285S","chronDate":"20-25 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5604820","isNumber":"5614036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5604820","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5614036","articleId":"5616799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5616807,"authors":[{"name":"Wenshuo Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenshuo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38559835100"},{"name":"Weixia Zou","affiliation":["Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weixia","lastName":"Zou","id":"37302064900"},{"name":"Bin Li","affiliation":["Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Li","id":"37599134900"},{"name":"Zheng Zhou","affiliation":["Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37278615200"},{"name":"Feng Zhao","affiliation":["Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37276958100"},{"name":"Zhiwei Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Network Laboratory, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiwei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37597982800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5305-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5306-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"5616807","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":232},"abstract":"To guarantee the next generation narrow band systems from Ultra Wideband (UWB) interference, the coexistence issue between OFDM-MIMO system and UWB system is studied in the indoor environment, using physical layer model simulation method.

Considering the environment and system parameters, the effective isotropic radiate power (EIRP) limit can be calculated in the basis of system bit error rate (BER). Nine operation bands are selected to cover all that used by OFDM-MIMO based wireless systems.

Wide Area Measurement Systems (WAMS) has been viewed as an ideal system to monitor power systems since it can provide comprehensive profile and dynamic behavior of the power systems. Whereas, for its demanding request on communication systems, it might not operate when part of communication systems fails. Therefore, it is highly preferred to facilitate Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) with the capability to transmit power system dynamics as an alternation. Based on the development of substation automation system, a novel approach is proposed to transmit system dynamics in existing SCADA using data compression. Uniform sampling based data compression and interpolation based reconstruction are utilized to reduce data volume and mitigate restriction of communication capacity. The system dynamics is compressed in Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) so that a few samplings could contain system dynamics information. The sampled data could be used to reconstruct dynamics information by interpolation. Simulation on a 36 nodes system shows feasibility of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.2010.5616813","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.2010.5616813","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel5/5610910/5614068/05616813.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmitting Power System Dynamics in Existing SCADA Using Sampling/Interpolation Based Data Compression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Transmitting Power System Dynamics in Existing SCADA Using Sampling/Interpolation Based Data Compression","conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5616813/","accessionNumber":"11626452","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5616813/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitting Power System Dynamics in Existing SCADA Using Sampling/Interpolation Based Data Compression","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ias10p03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074003S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610910","isNumber":"5614068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610910","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5614068","articleId":"5616813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5616816,"authors":[{"name":"Trung Kien Nguyen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Trung Kien","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38184428100"},{"name":"Hieu Nguyen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Hieu","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37403915400"},{"name":"Feng Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37269765900"},{"name":"Thomas Kaiser","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Technology, Leibniz University, Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Kaiser","id":"37269768700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5305-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5306-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-6588"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-6596"}],"articleNumber":"5616816","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":19,"totalDownloads":217},"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the impact of the spatial correlation on the performance of the spatial multiplexing (SM) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Ultra-WideBand (UWB) system in which both the pre-equalizer and pre-Rake-filter are deployed at the transmitter.

The energy detector, a non-coherent receiver, employs low sampling rates but suffers from reduced performance. In this work, the idea of multiple pulse transmissions is exploited to obtain highly accurate channel and range estimates using the low-complexity energy detector. A frequency offset is introduced between the sampling clock and the pulse repetition frequency. It is shown that with proper post-processing the quality of the channel estimate can be significantly increased and that time-of-arrival estimation accuracies in the order of 0.3 ns can be achieved independently of the integration period, using a 500 MHz UWB signal.

Specifically, for a realistic configuration (receiver placement, distance between transmit and receive antennas, and channel condition), we quantify the timing errors caused by the angle-dependent waveform distortion with First Peak detection, Leading-edge (LE) detection, and Matched Filter approaches at different relative angles between the boresights of the transmit and receive antennas. We then develop a new LE detection algorithm that virtually eliminates the timing errors caused by path-overlap.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","matched filters","multipath channels","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas","ultra wideband antennas","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high precision indoor UWB localization","three dimensional ultrawideband localization system","dense multipath environment","in-depth analysis","angle dependent received waveform distortion","peak detection","leading-edge detection","matched filter","receive antenna","transmit antenna","LE detection algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultra-wideband (UWB)","localization","time difference of arrival (TDOA)","pulse distortion","path-overlap"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICUWB.2010.5616888","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606680/5614039/05616888.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5614039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUWB.2010.5616888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-precision indoor UWB localization: Technical challenges and method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5616888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-precision indoor UWB localization: Technical challenges and method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5616888/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5616888/","accessionNumber":"11629142","conferenceDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-precision indoor UWB localization: Technical challenges and method","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"D1050633551.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090697S","chronDate":"20-23 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606680","isNumber":"5614039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606680","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"5614039","articleId":"5616888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5616889,"authors":[{"name":"Jagdish C.

This design performs as a system-centric controller. The NN is trained offline with extensive data, and is also adjusted online. Main advantage and uniqueness of the proposed scheme is the controllers' ability to complement each other in case of parametric and functional uncertainty. Moreover, the online neural network approximates the plant in the event of functional change during abnormal operating conditions. The theoretical results are validated by conducting simulation studies on a two area equivalent 5 generator, 8 bus multi-machine power system with varying generator schedules that shows low frequency oscillations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5616915/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5616915/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11626488","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Novel System-Centric Intelligent Adaptive Control Architecture for Damping Inter-Area Mode Oscillations in Power System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel System-Centric Intelligent Adaptive Control Architecture for Damping Inter-Area Mode Oscillations in Power System","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"ias13p01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057515S","chronDate":"3-7 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5610910","isNumber":"5614068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5610910","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5614068","articleId":"5616915","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5616924,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281392400"},{"name":"B.

In the work, it is shown how an open in a defective cell may influence the correct operation of a victim cell sharing the same read circuitry. Also, it is shown that the sequence of bits written on the defective cell prior to a read action can mask the presence of the defect. Different orders of critical resistance have been found depending on the location of the open defect.

The first prototype is able to achieve an excellent sidelobe level of -27.7\u00a0dB by properly meandering a long slot etched on the broadside of a straight SIW section from the centerline toward the sidewall then back. But it is known that an asymmetrically curved slot would worsen the cross-polar level. To overcome this drawback, a modified leaky-wave antenna is proposed, which has a straight long slot etched on the broadside of a meandering SIW section. It yields an outstanding sidelobe level of -29.3 dB and also improves the cross-polar level by more than 11 dB at 35 GHz. Experimental results agree well with simulations, thus validating our design. Then, a two-dimensional (2-D) multibeam antenna is developed by combining such 14 leaky-wave antennas with an SIW beamforming network (BFN). It has features of scanning both in elevation orientation by varying frequency and in cross-plane direction by using the BFN. Excited at ports 1-10 of such a 2-D multibeam antenna at 35 GHz, angular region of 86.6\u00b0 in azimuth can effectively be covered by 3 dB beam-width of ten pencil beams. Varying frequency from 33 GHz to 37 GHz, the angular region of 37.5\u00b0 and 38.9\u00b0 in elevation can be covered by 3 dB beam-width of those continuous scanning beams excited at ports 6 and 8 respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2090471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5679835/05617222.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2090471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5679835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Substrate Integrated Waveguide Long Slot Leaky-Wave Antennas and Two-Dimensional Multibeam Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617222","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617222/","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Substrate Integrated Waveguide Long Slot Leaky-Wave Antennas and Two-Dimensional Multibeam Applications","volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11729264","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617222/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-Wave Substrate Integrated Waveguide Long Slot Leaky-Wave Antennas and Two-Dimensional Multibeam Applications","sourcePdf":"tap-cheng-2090471-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105204S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5679835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"5679835","articleId":"5617222","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5617224,"authors":[{"name":"Qing-Xin Chu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Qing-Xin","lastName":"Chu","id":"37285768100"},{"name":"De-An Cao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"De-An","lastName":"Cao","id":"37600913400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5617224","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1159},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Slabs","Equations","Reflection","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chirality","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","Fourier analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LOD method","unconditionally stable 1D FDTD algorithm","locally one-dimensional method","one-dimensional nondispersive chiral media","mesh-dividing method","bi-isotropic media","curl equation","two-dimensional problem","2D problem","numerical simulation","Fourier stability analysis","Courant-Friedrich-Levy stability condition","CFL stability","finite-difference time-domain method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chiral media","finite-difference time-domain method (FDTD)","locally one-dimensional (LOD)","unconditionally stable"]}],"abstract":"An unconditionally stable scheme, which employs a similar technique to the locally one-dimensional (LOD) method, is proposed to study the one-dimensional (1D) nondispersive chiral media.

For the present application, classical IWO has been modified by introducing a more explorative routine of changing the standard deviation of the seed population (equivalent to mutation step-size in evolutionary algorithms) of the algorithm. Simulation results over three significant instances of the circular array design problem have been presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the modified IWO algorithm. The design results obtained with modified IWO have been shown to comfortably beat those obtained with other state-of-the-art metaheuristics like genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), original IWO and differential evolution (DE) in a statistically meaningful way.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5679835/05617225.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2090477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2090477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5679835","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Non-Uniform Circular Antenna Arrays Using a Modified Invasive Weed Optimization Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Gallium","Antenna radiation patterns","Cost function","Phased arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic coupling","optimisation","parameter estimation","planar antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniform circular antenna array","modified invasive weed optimization algorithm","ecologically inspired optimization algorithm","IWO algorithm","planar antenna array","mutual coupling effect","derivative-free real parameter optimizer"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circular antenna arrays","differential evolution (DE)","genetic algorithms (GAs)","invasive weed optimization (IWO)","particle swarm optimization (PSO)","real parameter optimization","sidelobe suppression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Design of Non-Uniform Circular Antenna Arrays Using a Modified Invasive Weed Optimization Algorithm","volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5617225/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11729265","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Non-Uniform Circular Antenna Arrays Using a Modified Invasive Weed Optimization Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tap-das-2090477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077726S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5679835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"5679835","articleId":"5617225","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5617230,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Yun Lau","affiliation":["Edward S.

Our goal is finding the insulation properties that facilitate power transmission, thus enhancing the communication between the implanted antenna and an external receiver. For this purpose, it has been found that a simplified model of human tissues based on spherical geometries excited by ideal sources (electric dipole, magnetic dipole and Huygens source) provides reasonable accuracy while remaining very tractable due to its analytical formulation. Our results show that a proper choice of the biocompatible internal insulation material can improve the radiation efficiency of the implanted antenna (up to six times for the investigated cases). External insulation facilitates the electromagnetic transition from the biological tissue to the outer free space, reducing the power absorbed by the human body. Summarizing, this work gives insights on the enhancement of power transmission, obtained with the use of both internal, biocompatible and external, flexible insulations.

High accuracy is achieved by the optimal selection of the coefficients used for the finite difference (FD) operators in the NS-FDTD method. However, the previously published method of obtaining the coefficients for rectangular cells, using a full numerical technique, takes an enormous amount of computing time.

It is shown, by numerical tests, that the optimal coefficients need six significant digits for accurate NS-FDTD solutions.

Following this, a compact three-element suspended plate antenna array with a bent ground plane is presented for WLAN MIMO applications. The diversity performance of the design is experimentally and numerically analyzed. Last, the design guidelines for the optimization of multiple suspended plate antennas in terms of their orientation and feed configuration is provided for achieving the upper bound of the diversity performance with minimum inter-element mutual coupling.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2090478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5679835/05617250.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2090478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5679835","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Optimization of Compact Suspended Plate MIMO Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617250/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Optimization of Compact Suspended Plate MIMO Antennas","volume":"59","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11729235","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617250/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Optimization of Compact Suspended Plate MIMO Antennas","sourcePdf":"tap-see-2090478-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099281S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5679835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5679835","articleId":"5617250","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5617253,"authors":[{"name":"Yizhen Tong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Yizhen","lastName":"Tong","id":"37400191400"},{"name":"Alan Tennant","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Alan","lastName":"Tennant","id":"37277283100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"5617253","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":702},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Amplitude modulation","Harmonic analysis","Switches","Linear antenna arrays","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","linear antenna arrays","modulation","power dividers","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced sideband level","half-power sub-arraying technique","harmonic pattern","time-modulated linear array","power loss","power divider","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear antenna arrays","reduced sidebands radiation","time modulation"]}],"abstract":"A new approach to reducing the sidebands levels and power losses in the harmonic patterns of time-modulated linear arrays is presented.

Its benefit over other single- and multi-microphone techniques has been shown in several previous contributions, theoretically as well as experimentally. In theoretical studies, it is usually assumed that there is a single target speech source. The filter can then be decomposed into a conceptually interesting structure, i.e., into a spatial filter (related to other known techniques) and a single-channel postfilter, which then also allows for a performance analysis. Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to make a robust practical implementation based on this decomposition. Instead, a general SDW-MWF implementation, which only requires a (relatively easy) estimation of speech and noise correlation matrices, is mostly used in practice. This paper features a theoretical study and experimental validation on a binaural hearing aid setup of this standard SDW-MWF implementation, where the effect of estimation errors in the second-order statistics is analyzed. In this case, and for a single target speech source, the standard SDW-MWF implementation is found not to behave as predicted theoretically. Second, two recently introduced alternative filters, namely the rank-one SDW-MWF and the spatial prediction SDW-MWF, are also studied in the presence of estimation errors in the second-order statistics. These filters implicitly assume a single target speech source, but still only rely on the speech and noise correlation matrices. It is proven theoretically and illustrated through experiments that these alternative SDW-MWF implementations behave close to the theoretical optimum, and hence outperform the standard SDW-MWF implementation.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2090519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5762410/05617258.pdf","startPage":"1368","endPage":"1381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2090519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5762410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Multichannel Wiener Filter-Based Noise Reduction in Hearing Aids Under Second Order Statistics Estimation Errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617258/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Multichannel Wiener Filter-Based Noise Reduction in Hearing Aids Under Second Order Statistics Estimation Errors","volume":"19","issue":"5","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"11987229","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617258/","dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Multichannel Wiener Filter-Based Noise Reduction in Hearing Aids Under Second Order Statistics Estimation Errors","sourcePdf":"tasl-cornelis-2090519-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096888S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5762410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5762410","articleId":"5617258","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5617259,"authors":[{"name":"Amit P.

In this paper, we illustrate the chicken-and-egg dilemma encountered in WZVC: high efficiency WZVC requires good estimation of side information (SI); however, good SI estimation is not possible for the decoder without access to the decoded current frame. To resolve such a dilemma, we present and advocate a framework that explores an important concept of decoder-side progressive-learning. More specifically, a decoder-side multi-resolution motion refinement (MRMR) scheme is proposed, where the decoder is able to learn from the already-decoded lower-resolution data to refine the motion estimation (ME), which in turn greatly improves the SI quality as well as the coding efficiency for the higher resolution data. Theoretical analysis shows that at high rates, decoder-side MRMR outperforms motion extrapolation by as much as 5 dB, while falling behind conventional encoder-side inter-frame ME by only about 1.5 dB. In addition, since decoder-side ME does not suffer from the bit-rate overhead in transmitting the motion information, further performance gain can be achieved for decoder-side MRMR by incorporating fractional-pel motion search, block matching with smaller block sizes, and multiple hypothesis prediction. We also present a practical WZVC implementation with MRMR, which shows comparable coding performance as H.264 at very high bit rates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617260/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","volume":"20","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"12086594","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617260/","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Motion Refinement Based Progressive Side-Information Estimation for Wyner-Ziv Video Coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Refinement Based Progressive Side-Information Estimation for Wyner-Ziv Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-liu-2090424-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120889S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"5704816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5704816","articleId":"5617260","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5617263,"authors":[{"name":"Jagdish Chandra Patra","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/5714224/5617263/5617263-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jagdish Chandra Patra (M'97) received the Ph.D. degree from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, in 1996.","He was a Reserch Fellow at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 1999.

Recently, there has been a surge in research efforts in multijunction (MJ) solar cells to improve the conversion efficiency. Modeling of MJ solar cells poses greater challenges because their characteristics depend on the complex photovoltaic phenomena and properties of the materials used. Currently, several commercial complex device modeling software packages, e.g., ATLAS, are available. But these software packages have limitations in predicting the behavior of MJ solar cells because of several assumptions made on the physical properties and complex interactions. Artificial neural networks have the ability to effectively model any nonlinear system with complex mapping between its input and output spaces. In this paper, we proposed a novel Chebyshev neural network (ChNN) to model a dual-junction (DJ) GaInP/GaAs solar cell. Using the ChNN, we have modeled the tunnel junction characteristics and developed models to predict the external quantum efficiency, and I-V characteristics both at one sun and at dark levels. We have shown that the ChNN-based models perform better than the commercial software, ATLAS, in predicting the DJ solar cell characteristics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617263/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11832592","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5617263/","publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Chebyshev Neural Network-Based Model for Dual-Junction Solar Cells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chebyshev Neural Network-Based Model for Dual-Junction Solar Cells","sourcePdf":"tec-patra-2079935-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100136S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"5714224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5714224","articleId":"5617263","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5617266,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Bian","affiliation":["Department of Geomatics Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/5738422/5617266/5617266-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Bian received the doctoral degree of engineering in communication and information system from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2005.

Both methods occur within the wavelet domain; however, the first method employs the wavelet packet, while the second method is performed in the undecimated wavelet domain. A major characteristic of InSAR phase data is that the noise level is spatially variable, and the proposed methods have a particularly good comparative performance in these situations. Tests are performed using simulated phase data and show that the proposed methods have lower root-mean-square error and less noisy fringes in the filtering results than those of three existing \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d wavelet-domain phase-filtering methods.

These images are estimated in practice from a Hermitian product on local windows. These windows lead to biases and resolution losses due to the local heterogeneity caused by edges and textures. This paper proposes a nonlocal approach for the joint estimation of the reflectivity, the interferometric phase, and the coherence images from an interferometric pair of coregistered single-look complex (SLC) SAR images. Nonlocal techniques are known to efficiently reduce noise while preserving structures by performing the weighted averaging of similar pixels. Two pixels are considered similar if the surrounding image patches are \u201cresembling.\u201d Patch similarity is usually defined as the Euclidean distance between the vectors of graylevels. In this paper, a statistically grounded patch-similarity criterion suitable to SLC images is derived. A weighted maximum likelihood estimation of the SAR interferogram is then computed with weights derived in a data-driven way. Weights are defined from the intensity and interferometric phase and are iteratively refined based both on the similarity between noisy patches and on the similarity of patches from the previous estimate. The efficiency of this new interferogram construction technique is illustrated both qualitatively and quantitatively on synthetic and true data.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2076376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5738422/05617267.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2076376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5738422","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NL-InSAR: Nonlocal Interferogram Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"NL-InSAR: Nonlocal Interferogram Estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617267/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"49","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11883204","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5617267/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NL-InSAR: Nonlocal Interferogram Estimation","sourcePdf":"tgrs-deledalle-2076376-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123515S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5738422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"155","xplore-issue":"5738422","articleId":"5617267","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":5617273,"authors":[{"name":"Taejoong Song","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Company Limited, Yongin si, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/5725255/5617273/5617273-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Taejoong Song (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1995 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), Atlanta, in 2010.","Prior to joining the Georgia Tech, he was with Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea, working on the development of embedded static random-access memory (SRAM) from 1997 to 2005.

It is an unsupervised learning algorithm, which finds a basis set capturing high-level semantics in the data and learns sparse coordinates in terms of the basis set. Originally applied to modeling the human visual cortex, sparse coding has been shown useful for many applications. However, most of the existing approaches to sparse coding fail to consider the geometrical structure of the data space. In many real applications, the data is more likely to reside on a low-dimensional submanifold embedded in the high-dimensional ambient space. It has been shown that the geometrical information of the data is important for discrimination. In this paper, we propose a graph based algorithm, called graph regularized sparse coding, to learn the sparse representations that explicitly take into account the local manifold structure of the data. By using graph Laplacian as a smooth operator, the obtained sparse representations vary smoothly along the geodesics of the data manifold. The extensive experimental results on image classification and clustering have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617279/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11960233","pubMedId":"21047712","htmlLink":"/document/5617279/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Graph Regularized Sparse Coding for Image Representation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph Regularized Sparse Coding for Image Representation","sourcePdf":"tip-zheng-2090535-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098333S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5750157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"384","xplore-issue":"5750157","articleId":"5617279","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5617283,"authors":[{"name":"Saiprasad Ravishankar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Saiprasad","lastName":"Ravishankar","id":"38181158900"},{"name":"Yoram Bresler","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yoram","lastName":"Bresler","id":"37267364600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"5617283","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":537,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":9999},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Image reconstruction","Wavelet transforms","Magnetic resonance imaging","Pixel","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","finite difference methods","image reconstruction","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","sampling methods","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MR image reconstruction","highly undersampled k-space data","compressed sensing","wavelet transforms","curvelet transforms","finite difference transforms","learning framework","analytical sparsifying transform","alternating reconstruction algorithm","numerical experiments","signal-noise ratios","sparsifying dictionary","dictionary learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing (CS)","dictionary learning","image reconstruction","magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)","reduced encoding","sparse representation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Brain","Databases, Factual","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Lumbosacral Region","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Models, Theoretical"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617283","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5760040/05617283.pdf","startPage":"1028","endPage":"1041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2010.2090538","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2010.2090538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5760040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MR Image Reconstruction From Highly Undersampled k-Space Data by Dictionary Learning","abstract":"Compressed sensing (CS) utilizes the sparsity of magnetic resonance (MR) images to enable accurate reconstruction from undersampled k-space data. Recent CS methods have employed analytical sparsifying transforms such as wavelets, curvelets, and finite differences. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adaptively learning the sparsifying transform (dictionary), and reconstructing the image simultaneously from highly undersampled k-space data. The sparsity in this framework is enforced on overlapping image patches emphasizing local structure. Moreover, the dictionary is adapted to the particular image instance thereby favoring better sparsities and consequently much higher undersampling rates. The proposed alternating reconstruction algorithm learns the sparsifying dictionary, and uses it to remove aliasing and noise in one step, and subsequently restores and fills-in the k-space data in the other step. Numerical experiments are conducted on MR images and on real MR data of several anatomies with a variety of sampling schemes. The results demonstrate dramatic improvements on the order of 4-18 dB in reconstruction error and doubling of the acceptable undersampling factor using the proposed adaptive dictionary as compared to previous CS methods. These improvements persist over a wide range of practical data signal-to-noise ratios, without any parameter tuning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617283/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","volume":"30","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11972236","pubMedId":"21047708","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5617283/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"MR Image Reconstruction From Highly Undersampled k-Space Data by Dictionary Learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MR Image Reconstruction From Highly Undersampled k-Space Data by Dictionary Learning","sourcePdf":"tmi-ravishankar-2090538-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.181252S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5760040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"537","xplore-issue":"5760040","articleId":"5617283","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5617288,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Acharyya","affiliation":["Pervasive Systems Centre, School of Electronics and Computer Science (ECS), University of Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5685344/5617288/5617288-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amit Acharyya received the B.E. degree (First-class Hons.) in electronics and communication engineering from National Institute of Technology (formerly Regional Engineering College), Durgapur, India, in 2005.","He joined National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Pune, India as a Visiting Researcher.

In this paper firstly, we identify the application domain of cross-product in signal processing and then introduce a novel recursive algorithm for generalized nD cross-product computation considering three dimensional (3D) cross-product as the fundamental operation. Subsequently a generalized scheme for architecture implementation for nD cross-product is proposed based on this algorithm. Secondly, we show that if 4D cross-product is used as the fundamental operation for formulating nD cross-product problem, then exploiting the inherent mathematical symmetry of 4D cross-product it is possible to reduce the total hardware cost of nD cross-product significantly at the architecture level (symmetry-based approach). Mathematical models for hardware complexity and operational delay have been formulated both for the generalized and symmetry-based approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithm and Architecture for N-D Vector Cross-Product Computation","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2090523","startPage":"812","endPage":"826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2090523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5685344/05617288.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617288/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Algorithm and Architecture for N-D Vector Cross-Product Computation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5617288/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11742841","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithm and Architecture for N-D Vector Cross-Product Computation","sourcePdf":"tsp-acharyya-2090523-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084236S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5685344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5685344","articleId":"5617288","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5617289,"authors":[{"name":"Petre Stoica","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Petre Stoica (SM'91\u2013F'94) is a Professor of systems modeling in the Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.","More details about him can be found at http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/ps."]},"firstName":"Petre","lastName":"Stoica","id":"37277401700"},{"name":"Prabhu Babu","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Prabhu Babu received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India, in 2007.","He is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering with applications in signal processing at the Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."]},"firstName":"Prabhu","lastName":"Babu","id":"37604165100"},{"name":"Jian Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Jian Li (S'88\u2013M'90\u2013SM'97\u2013F'05) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from The Ohio State University (OSU), Columbus, in 1987 and 1991, respectively.","From April to June 1991, she was an Adjunct Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, OSU.

First, the optimal systems require a large number of feedback bits from the receiver to encode the full precoding matrix. Second, the full precoding matrix leads to complex computations. These disadvantages become more severe as the bandwidth (BW) efficiency increases. In this paper, we propose using block diagonal geometric mean decomposition (BD-GMD) to design the transceiver. Two new BD-GMD transceivers are proposed: the ZF-BD-GMD system, where the receiver is a zero-forcing DFE (ZF-DFE), and the MMSE-BD-GMD system, where the receiver is a minimum- mean-square-error DFE (MMSE-DFE). The BD-GMD systems introduced here have the following four properties: a) They use the block diagonal unitary precoding technique to reduce the required number of encoding bits and simplify the computation. b) For any block size, the BD-GMD systems are optimal within the family of systems using block diagonal unitary precoders and DFEs. As block size gets larger, the BD-GMD systems produce uncoded bit error rate (BER) performance similar to the optimal systems using unitary precoders and DFEs. c) For the two ZF transceivers (ZF-Optimal and ZF-BD-GMD) and the two MMSE transceivers (MMSE-Optimal and MMSE-BD-GMD), the average BER degrades as the BW efficiency increases. d) In the case of single-input single-output (SISO) channels, the BD-GMD systems have the same performance as those of the lazy precoder transceivers. These properties make the proposed BD-GMD systems more favorable designs in practical implementation than the optimal systems.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2090522","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5685344/05617291.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2090522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5685344","startPage":"713","endPage":"727","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block Diagonal GMD for Zero-Padded MIMO Frequency Selective Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Block Diagonal GMD for Zero-Padded MIMO Frequency Selective Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617291/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11742837","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5617291/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block Diagonal GMD for Zero-Padded MIMO Frequency Selective Channels","sourcePdf":"tsp-weng-2090522-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084857S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5685344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5685344","articleId":"5617291","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5617294,"authors":[{"name":"Jau-Horng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science and Ocean Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jau-Horng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280678200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5617294","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":912},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Radio transmitters","Prototypes","Microwave amplifiers","Power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","pulse modulation","radio transmitters","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficiency-improved outphasing power amplifier","RF pulse modulation","outphasing amplifier","transmitter system","CDMA2000","power-added efficiency","alternate channel power ratios","outphasing angle","frequency 836.5 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave amplifiers","power amplifiers (PAs)","radio transmitters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617294","abstract":"This letter presents a method for improving the efficiency of an outphasing amplifier by pulse modulating the input signals.

The class-E auxiliary amplifier has a lower driving power and a higher output power capability than the class-E auxiliary frequency doubler.

Studies with the New England 39-bus test system and the Venezuelan power network indicated that faster and more accurate predictions can be made by using the post-fault recovery voltage magnitude measurements as inputs. The accuracy and robustness of the transient stability prediction algorithm with the voltage magnitude measurements was extensively tested under both balanced and unbalanced fault conditions, as well as under different operating conditions, presence of measurement errors, voltage sensitive loads, and changes in the network topology. During the various tests carried out using the New England 39-bus test system, the proposed algorithm could always predict when the power system is approaching a transient instability with over 95% success rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Support Vector Machine-Based Algorithm for Post-Fault Transient Stability Status Prediction Using Synchronized Measurements","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2082575","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5958775/05617329.pdf","startPage":"1474","endPage":"1483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2082575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5958775","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617329/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Support Vector Machine-Based Algorithm for Post-Fault Transient Stability Status Prediction Using Synchronized Measurements","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5617329/","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12175084","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Support Vector Machine-Based Algorithm for Post-Fault Transient Stability Status Prediction Using Synchronized Measurements","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-gomez-2082575-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071043S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5958775","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"225","xplore-issue":"5958775","articleId":"5617329","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5617347,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenwei Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry of National Education Ministry, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5617343/5617347/5617347-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhenwei Liu received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and automation from the Changchun Institute of Technology, Changchun, China, in 2004.

We report 12-nm wavelength conversion of 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 Gb/s return-to-zero (RZ) signals. We find that pure XGM is effective for wavelength conversion without significant pattern effects up to around 40 Gb/s. At higher bit rates, distortion-free conversion can be obtained by exploiting jointly XGM and some cross-phase modulation that arises at the same time in the amplifier. This can be easily achieved by using a slightly blue-shifted output band-pass filter. By testing the signal integrity by means of the factor analysis, we also find that the XGM transfer function attenuates the input intensity noise. Finally, we show how the output inverse-RZ signals obtained in the XGM conversion can be format-converted back to RZ by side-band filtering.","doi":"10.1109/JQE.2010.2060714","publicationTitle":"IEEE

Two types of electron injection scheme: both side injection scheme and self-repair one side injection scheme are analyzed comprehensively for 65nm technology node 8T-SRAM cell and also for 6T-SRAM cell. This paper shows that in the 6T-SRAM with the local injected electrons the read speed degrades by as much as 6.3 times. In contrast, the proposed 8T-SRAM cell with the self-repair one side injection scheme is most suitable to solve the conflict of the half select disturb, write disturb and read speed. In the proposed 8T-SRAM, the disturb margin increases by 141% without write margin or read speed degradation. The proposed scheme has no process or area penalty compared with the standard CMOS-process 8T-SRAM.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference 2010","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605059/5617377/05617440.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2010.5617440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2010.5617440","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elimination of half select disturb in 8T-SRAM by local injected electron asymmetric pass gate transistor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617440/","displayDocTitle":"Elimination of half select disturb in 8T-SRAM by local injected electron asymmetric pass gate transistor","htmlLink":"/document/5617440/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11627827","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elimination of half select disturb in 8T-SRAM by local injected electron asymmetric pass gate transistor","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"M10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066102S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605059","isNumber":"5617377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605059","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5617377","articleId":"5617440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5617444,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Hung Chen","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Po-Hung Chen","id":"37600340600"},{"name":"Koichi Ishida","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Ishida","id":"37301617200"},{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Xin Zhang","id":"37598109000"},{"name":"Yasuaki Okuma","affiliation":["Semiconductor Technology Academic Research Center, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuaki","lastName":"Okuma","id":"37603383900"},{"name":"Yoshikatsu Ryu","affiliation":["Semiconductor Technology Academic Research Center, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshikatsu","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37586094200"},{"name":"Makoto Takamiya","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Makoto","lastName":"Takamiya","id":"37282760800"},{"name":"Takayasu Sakurai","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takayasu","lastName":"Sakurai","id":"37275966400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5760-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5758-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5759-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-3630"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0886-5930"},{"format":"CD","value":"0886-5930"}],"articleNumber":"5617444","dbTime":"56 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2499},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Charge pumps","Converters","Voltage measurement","MOSFETs","Clocks","CMOS integrated circuits","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge pump circuits","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward body biasing","startup circuit","CMOS","three-stage charge pump circuit","MOSFET","boost converter","energy sources","voltage 0.18 V","size 65 nm","voltage 0.74 V","current 6 mA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a 0.18-V input three-stage charge pump circuit applying forward body bias is proposed.

The stacking memory adopts three-dimensional (3D) IC technology, which leverages through-silicon-vias (TSVs) to connect layers, to dramatically reduce the access latency and improve the bandwidth without the constraint of I/O pins. To demonstrate the feasibility of 3D memory stacking, this paper introduces a customized 3D Double-Data-Rate (DDR) SDRAM controller design, which communicates with DRAM layers by TSVs. In addition, we propose a parallel access policy to further improve the performance. The 3D DDR controller is integrated in a 3D stacking System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture, where a high-bandwidth 3D DRAM chip is stacked on the top. The 3D SoC is divided into two logic layers with each having an area of 2.5 \u00d7 5.0mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, with a 3-layer 2Gb DRAM stacking. The whole chip has been fabricated in Chartered 130nm low-power process and Tezzaron's 3D bonding technology.

Because of incorporating an inherent PID control structure, it is easy to use a well-designed PID controller to guide the initial weighs choosing for the action network. Based on this framework, a novel initializing approach is suggested based on a PID controller, such that the DHDP learning process starts from a good enough initial state.

Implemented in a 0.35-\u03bcm CMOS process, the proposed buck converter can operate at 5-MHz with a duty-ratio range of 0.6, use a small-value off-chip inductor of 1 \u03bcH, and achieve 91% peak power efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2010.5617587","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605059/5617377/05617587.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference 2010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2010.5617587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 5-MHz 91% peak-power-efficiency buck regulator with auto-selectable peak- and valley-current control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regulators","Sensors","Converters","Inductors","Voltage control","Switching frequency","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","electric current control","feedback","power electronics","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["peak-power-efficiency buck regulator","auto-selectable peak-current control","auto-selectable valley-current control","dynamically-biased shunt feedback","current sensors","CMOS process","frequency 5 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A 5-MHz 91% peak-power-efficiency buck regulator with auto-selectable peak- and valley-current control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617587/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11627743","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 5-MHz 91% peak-power-efficiency buck regulator with auto-selectable peak- and valley-current control","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"112.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042417S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605059","isNumber":"5617377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605059","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5617377","articleId":"5617587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5617590,"authors":[{"name":"Edward N.

Ultra-fast counters, single-particle detectors have been instruments of investigations since decades now. Additionally, electronic systems played a pivotal role in the progress of biosciences, for example, by allowing single ion channel recording in the early days of electrophysiology or by providing the necessary signal amplification during the discovery of atomic force microscopes. The role of integrated silicon regarding bioelectronic systems has been recently even more effective due to the device area reduction, allowing smart arrangement of interfaces onto arrays. Interestingly, even if the technology scaling is not favorable with respect to the signal to noise ratio, there is a remarkable trend over the last decade about interface performances confirmed by several figures of merit. The paper will show how circuit techniques and reduction of stray capacitance play a crucial role on the improvements of performances.

Variability is characterized with respect to the distribution of its components, its spatial and temporal characteristics and its impact on specific circuit topologies.

Transistor and ring oscillator arrays are designed to isolate specific systematic and random variability components in the design. Distributions of SRAM design margins are measured by padded-out cells and minimum operating voltages for the entire array. Correlations between various components of variability are essential for adding appropriate margins to the design.","doi":"10.1109/CICC.2010.5617628","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5605059/5617377/05617628.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.2010.5617628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference 2010","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Technology variability from a design perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617628","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Technology variability from a design perspective","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617628/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617628/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11627734","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technology variability from a design perspective","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114636S","chronDate":"19-22 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5605059","isNumber":"5617377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5605059","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5617377","articleId":"5617628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":5617629,"authors":[{"name":"Shunsuke Okumura","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shunsuke","lastName":"Okumura","id":"37604798700"},{"name":"Shusuke Yoshimoto","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Shusuke","lastName":"Yoshimoto","id":"37605295600"},{"name":"Kosuke Yamaguchi","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Kosuke","lastName":"Yamaguchi","id":"37587371900"},{"name":"Yohei Nakata","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yohei","lastName":"Nakata","id":"37534221400"},{"name":"Hiroshi Kawaguchi","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Kawaguchi","id":"37270375100"},{"name":"Masahiko Yoshimoto","affiliation":["Kobe University, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Yoshimoto","id":"37269600500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5760-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5758-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5759-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-3630"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0886-5930"},{"format":"CD","value":"0886-5930"}],"articleNumber":"5617629","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Multicore processing","Clocks","Layout","Energy consumption","Decoding","Writing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["7T SRAM","low-energy simultaneous block copy","checkpoint data storage","transactional memory","memory size 1 MByte","voltage 1.2 V"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes 7T SRAM which realizes block-level simultaneous copying feature.

We show correlation between a bitcell's power-up state and its static noise margin. By applying stress with periodic re-power-up, device mismatch can be compensated by BTI induced changes. The proposed method has no extra design and area cost. It can be applied during burn-in test to offset manufacturing variation and/or used during the lifetime of the chip to offset variation from real-time aging and hence continue to improve the margins. Simulations in 45nm show that write, read, and hold Vmin at 6\u03c3 can be reduced by 128, 75, and 91 mV, respectively.

Structural deformation equations for the proposed generator are derived, and the structural dimensions of the generator are initially determined from the equations. Using a three-dimensional finite element analysis, the structural dimensions are modified and the structural mass is estimated. The total mass of the proposed generator estimated by the design and the analysis is 89, 195 and 430 tonnes for 5, 10 and 20 MW wind turbines.

Magnetic induction has been extensively used for wireless power transfer, but its efficiency depends on magnetic coupling that decays as the inverse cube of distance. At long enough distances, the magnetic coupling is weak enough that the effect of the receiver coil on the sender coil can be neglected. In this weakly coupled limit, series resonance in both the sender and the receiver increases the power transfer. Compared to magnetic induction, the power transfer increases by the sum of the quality factors of the sender and the receiver times the quality factor of the sender. Similarly, the efficiency increases by half of the product of the quality factors of the sender and the receiver. However, the overall efficiency of the power transfer is less than 50% for all weakly coupled series resonators. Resonators with a Q of 1,000 should be able to send power over a distance 9 times the radius of the devices with an efficiency of 10%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless power transfer using weakly coupled magnetostatic resonators","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617728","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05617728.pdf","startPage":"4179","endPage":"4186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Wireless power transfer using weakly coupled magnetostatic resonators","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617728/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628771","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless power transfer using weakly coupled magnetostatic resonators","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"6060308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046335S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5617729,"authors":[{"name":"RamKrishan Maheshwari","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"RamKrishan","lastName":"Maheshwari","id":"37604134300"},{"name":"Stig Munk-Nielsen","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Stig","lastName":"Munk-Nielsen","id":"38260430700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5617729","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":441},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617729","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Capacitors","Inverters","Induction machines","Bandwidth","Stators","Rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","closed loop systems","damping","electric current control","machine vector control","PWM power convertors","variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop control","active damping technique","small DC-link capacitor based drive system","stator flux oriented control","induction machine drive","machine current reference","current control loop bandwidth","variable speed drives","pulse width modulated power converters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Control systems","Pulse width modulated power converters","Variable speed drives"]}],"abstract":"A new method of active damping for small DC-link capacitor based drive system is implemented in stator flux oriented control for an induction machine.

Then we give some examples on how established characterization techniques that were developed for silicon based devices can be completely misinterpreted when applied to Ge or III-V based MOS-structures, and how a simple modification of the technique can ensure a correct interpretation. We also show how novel techniques, such as TSCIS (Trap spectroscopy by Charge Injection and Sensing). were developed recently to overcome the problem of dielectric material screening for logic and memory applications. With the scaling of the devices into the nanometer regime single traps are causing large variations in the device parameters, which leads to a time-dependent variability, which makes lifetime analysis difficult. Finally we show that when using the classical reliability assessment methodology based on accelerated testing, the available reliability margins are strongly reduced, in some cases even down to zero, especially for sub-1nm EOT (Effective Oxide Thickness) devices. As a result, we argue that the reliability community will have to look for alternative ways to ensure and guarantee the lifetime of future products.","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2010.5617735","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609035/5617713/05617735.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"72","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the European Solid State Device Research Conference","publicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the European Solid State Device Research Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2010.5617735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trends and perspectives for electrical characterization and reliability assessment in advanced CMOS technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617735/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Trends and perspectives for electrical characterization and reliability assessment in advanced CMOS technologies","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11626269","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5617735/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trends and perspectives for electrical characterization and reliability assessment in advanced CMOS technologies","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"D0094489.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109685S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609035","isNumber":"5617713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609035","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5617713","articleId":"5617735","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5617748,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Gong","affiliation":["Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Gong","id":"37085716804"},{"name":"Dewei Xu","affiliation":["Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Dewei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37064999700"},{"name":"Bin Wu","affiliation":["Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37275265600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5617748","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":483},"abstract":"In this paper, the network damping capability of DFIG-based wind farm is investigated.

Both small signal stability and large transient stability are explored based on a generic power system consisting of both synchronous generator and DFIG. Networking damping performance of DFIG equipped with different active damping schemes is examined and compared. The results of both eigenvalues analysis and time-domain simulation are presented. The study shows that DFIG-based wind farms have the capability to enhance the network damping with the proposed damping strategy while this capability is constrained by some conditions.

Experimental results verify that it can start up by itself without using any auxiliary circuit, and that it achieves controlling the same amount of negative-sequence reactive power as the converter capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05617757.pdf","startPage":"3949","endPage":"3954","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617757","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Negative-sequence reactive-power control by the modular multilevel cascade converter based on double-star chopper-cells (MMCC-DSCC)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Converters","Inductors","Reactive power","Automatic voltage control","Leg","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power convertors","reactive power control","static VAr compensators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["negative-sequence reactive power control","modular multilevel cascade converter","double-star chopper cells","MMCC-DSCC","static synchronous compensator","STATCOM","EMI emissions","voltage 200 V","apparent power 10 kVA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cascade connection","STATCOM","modular multi-level cascade converters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Negative-sequence reactive-power control by the modular multilevel cascade converter based on double-star chopper-cells (MMCC-DSCC)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617757/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628424","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Negative-sequence reactive-power control by the modular multilevel cascade converter based on double-star chopper-cells (MMCC-DSCC)","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"5730423.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072104S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5617759,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["FREEDM Systems Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37578781900"},{"name":"Gangyao Wang","affiliation":["FREEDM Systems Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Gangyao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404548700"},{"name":"Subhashish Bhattacharya","affiliation":["FREEDM Systems Center, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Subhashish","lastName":"Bhattacharya","id":"37307719200"},{"name":"Alex Q.

However the bandwidth and slew rate required by modern communication signals is higher than the maximum slew-rate achievable by switching DC/DC converters made for these purpose. The slew rate of these switching DC/DC converter can be improved by combining it with the use of a linear stage, thus establishing a trade-off between slew rate and overall efficiency. This paper presents a simple way of combining the use of both a switching DC/DC converter, the Multiple Input Buck Converter, and a linear stage to obtain slew-rates above 100 V/\u03bcs, with a moderate decrease in the overall efficiency (81% efficiency tracking the envelope of an EDGE standard signal). Finally, a prototype of the complete system (including the digital control for both stages) is presented in this paper.","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05617762.pdf","startPage":"3825","endPage":"3832","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617762","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A linear assisted DC/DC converter for Envelope Tracking and Envelope Elimination and Restoration applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A linear assisted DC/DC converter for Envelope Tracking and Envelope Elimination and Restoration applications","htmlLink":"/document/5617762/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11628428","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A linear assisted DC/DC converter for Envelope Tracking and Envelope Elimination and Restoration applications","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"5560513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047735S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5617763,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Linear power amplifiers (classes A, B and AB) are commonly used, but they suffer from low efficiency especially if the transmitted signal has high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Kahn's technique based on envelope elimination and restoration (EER) is based on idea that high efficiency power supply (envelope amplifier) could be used to modulate the envelope of high efficient non linear power amplifiers (classes D or E). This paper presents solutions for power amplifier that performs envelope modulation and class E amplifier that is used as a non linear amplifier. The envelope amplifier is implemented as a multilevel converter in series with linear regulator and can provide up to 100 W of instantaneous power and reproduce 2 MHz sine wave. The implemented Class E amplifier can operate at 120 MHz with efficiency near to 85%. The envelope amplifier and class E amplifier have been integrated and efficiency and linearity of the implemented transmitter has been measured and presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617763/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5617763/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628429","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"High efficiency power amplifier based on envelope elimination and restoration technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High efficiency power amplifier based on envelope elimination and restoration technique","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"5570800.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061366S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5617767,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Dong","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES) The Bradley Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Dong","id":"37588136900"},{"name":"Dushan Boroyevich","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES) The Bradley Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Dushan","lastName":"Boroyevich","id":"37274991300"},{"name":"Ruxi Wang","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES) The Bradley Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Ruxi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406139500"},{"name":"Igor Cvetkovic","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES) The Bradley Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Cvetkovic","id":"37590081600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5617767","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1823},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617767","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Capacitors","Converters","Topology","Bidirectional control","Renewable energy resources","Transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","load flow control","power capacitors","power grids","PWM power convertors","renewable energy sources","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-stage high power density single-phase AC-DC converter","bi-directional PWM converter","bulk DC-link capacitor","DC renewable energy systems","single-phase utility grid","bi-directional power flow control system","DC-bus voltage regulation","H-bridge","bi-directional SR DC-DC converter","grid-interfaced single-phase PWM converter","two-stage topology","design process","intrinsic short-circuit protection ability","system-level design","ripple power filtering","power 10 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Single-phase","DC-AC Power Conversion","Renewable Energy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617767","endPage":"3869","startPage":"3862","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05617767.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-stage high power density single-phase ac-dc bi-directional PWM converter for renewable energy systems","abstract":"It is well-known that single-phase ac-dc conversion requires a bulky dc-link capacitor for filtering the ripple power from the grid. Also, in order to interface a dc renewable energy system to a single-phase utility grid, bi-directional power flow control and dc-bus voltage regulation are major concerns. By using an H-bridge in series with a bi-directional SR dc-dc converter, this paper proposes a two-stage topology as a grid-interfaced single-phase PWM converter which reduces the dc-link capacitor value.

However, the rotational speed in previous bearing topologies has been limited by complex rotor constructions, high rotor losses, or position control instabilities at high speed. This paper presents a novel Lorentz-type, slotless self-bearing motor concept which overcomes most limitations of previously presented high-speed AMBs. An analytical model for motor torque and bearing forces is presented and a design for 500 000 rpm is verified with FE simulations, showing exceptionally low negative stiffness cross coupling.

In contrast to the similar series connected H-bridge converters an expensive and lossy transformer is not necessary. The capacitors buffer power fluctuations at fundamental and second harmonic frequency, therefore the capacitor voltage ripple magnitude increases with decreasing phase current frequencies and will become infinite at zero phase current frequency. This is a problem in variable speed drive applications where phase current frequencies from starting from zero are needed. An operating mode for low phase current frequencies which enables MMLCs to magnetize and start induction machines with quadratic torque loads is presented and the achievable torque-speed characteristic is derived. It is also shown that rotor flux optimization also reduces the capacitor voltage ripple at low torque.

This is due to the advantages they provide including shorter non-overlapping end turns, higher efficiency, higher power density, higher slot fill factor, lower manufacturing cost, better flux-weakening capability resulting in wider constant power vs. speed range, and fault-tolerance. This paper focuses on eddy current losses in the rotor clamping rings. Losses in the non-magnetic shaft with the option of i) metallic, ii) nonmetallic, and iii) metallic with shielding laminations clamping rings are analyzed. The study is based on Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Desirable slot/pole combinations for different number of phases with both single- and double-layer windings are investigated. Experimental results for a 3-phase 12slot/10pole design will be presented to confirm that the losses in the rotor clamping rings can be very significant in case of FSCW and should not be overlooked during the design phase.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05617807.pdf","startPage":"1312","endPage":"1320","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotor end losses in multi-phase fractional-slot concentrated-winding permanent magnet synchronous machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clamps","Rotors","Harmonic analysis","Windings","Eddy currents","Electric potential","Power capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eddy current losses","finite element analysis","machine windings","permanent magnet machines","rotors","synchronous machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotor end losses","multiphase fractional slot concentrated winding","permanent magnet synchronous machines","FSCW","PMSM","eddy current losses","finite element analysis","FEA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["clamping ring","concentrated windings","end effects","end shields","fractional-slot","permanent magnet","machine","surface","synchronous"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Rotor end losses in multi-phase fractional-slot concentrated-winding permanent magnet synchronous machines","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617807/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628469","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotor end losses in multi-phase fractional-slot concentrated-winding permanent magnet synchronous machines","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"1880037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057635S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5617817,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The AC drives considered here are the Induction Motor (IM) drives, Synchronous Reluctance (SyR) and synchronous Permanent Magnet (PM) drives of the Interior PM (IPM) and Surface-mounted PM (SPM) types. The proposed controller operates in stator flux coordinates: the stator flux amplitude is directly controlled by the direct voltage component, while the torque is controlled by regulating the quadrature current component. The control firmware is the same for all the motor under test with the only exception of the magnetic model used for flux estimation at low speed. The UDFVC is particularly convenient when flux-weakening is required, since it easily guarantees maximum torque production under current and voltage limitations. Experimental results on four different drives are provided.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05617840.pdf","startPage":"1150","endPage":"1157","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified Direct-Flux Vector Control for AC motor drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronous motors","Torque","Stators","Rotors","Magnetic flux","Saturation magnetization","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","motion control","reluctance motor drives","variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified direct-flux vector control","AC motor drives","induction motor drives","synchronous reluctance drives","synchronous permanent magnet drives","stator flux coordinates","quadrature current component","flux estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Variable Speed Drives","Synchronous Motor Drives","Permanent magnet machines","Traction Motor Drives","Motion Control","Flux-weakening","Limited Voltage Control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Unified Direct-Flux Vector Control for AC motor drives","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617840/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628501","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified Direct-Flux Vector Control for AC motor drives","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"1660337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09999S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5617843,"authors":[{"name":"Yushi Miura","affiliation":["Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yushi","lastName":"Miura","id":"37402719700"},{"name":"Masato Kaga","affiliation":["Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Kaga","id":"37590066900"},{"name":"Yasuhisa Horita","affiliation":["Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhisa","lastName":"Horita","id":"37602461400"},{"name":"Toshifumi Ise","affiliation":["Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshifumi","lastName":"Ise","id":"37273766600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5617843","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2087},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Converters","Switches","Clamps","Capacitors","Zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clamps","DC-DC power convertors","electric current control","electrolytic capacitors","power capacitors","switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bidirectional isolated dual full-bridge DC-DC converter","EDLC","electric double layer capacitor","DC distribution system","high-frequency transformer","active clamp switch","phase-shift control","soft-switching technique","discharge power mode","switching loss reduction","current suppression","loss analysis","power 1 kW","power 1 MW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-DC power conversion","soft switching","EDLC","DC distribution"]}],"abstract":"A high-power bidirectional isolated dual full-bridge dc-dc converter with an active clamp for a electric double layer capacitor (EDLC), which is installed into a dc distribution system, is investigated. This dc-dc converter consists of two full-bridge converters on both low and high voltage sides, a high-frequency transformer, an active clamp switch and a capacitor. Phase-shift control is employed to regulate charge and discharge power, and soft-switching technique is also applied to reduce switching losses. In addition, a new control scheme to suppress current flowing into the active clamp is introduced.

Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS), battery charging systems, photovoltaic equipment and auxiliary power supplies in traction applications are examples of some fields of application of this kind of converters. A Dual Active Bridge (DAB) bidirectional DC/DC converter is a topology with the advantages of decreased number of devices, soft-switching commutations, low cost, and high efficiency. The use of this topology is proposed for applications where the power density, cost, weight, and reliability are critical factors. In the present paper the steady-state analysis of the converter has been carried out, giving some guidelines for the design (considering soft switching limits and the amount of reactive current) and a small-signal model of the topology.

Existing burn-in process for electronic ballasts is conducted by connecting lamps or resistors at their output. All electrical energy is converted into heat and light. Not only does this method waste electricity, it also raises room temperatures in the factory, which results in installing ventilation systems to release the excessive heat. This paper presents an energy-recyclable burn-in technology for electronic ballast for HPS lamps. The device can emulate the lamp characteristics, process high-frequency ballast output power and recycle the power back into the grid. An experimental prototype for a 400W high-pressure sodium (HPS) electronic ballast is built and evaluated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5617867/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628526","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An energy-recyclable burn-in technology for electronic ballasts for HID lamps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy-recyclable burn-in technology for electronic ballasts for HID lamps","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"1480732.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089732S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5617875,"authors":[{"name":"Anderson V.

The protection of such converters against internal faults has been addressed in the technical literature, but the main focus has been on the solutions to disconnect the converter from the mains. In this paper, the short circuit current paths through the power devices in the three level NPC bridge are identified and studied from the perspective of keeping the overall repair cost, after a fault leading to the shoot-through mode, to a minimum. It is shown in this paper that a preferred short-circuit current path that limits the thermal energy in all IGCTs to safe levels exists. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that it is possible to guarantee, through proper busbar geometry and/or device selection, that the short-circuit current stress can always be moved to the power diodes. Simulation results are presented to support all the discussions and conclusions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Converters","Semiconductor diodes","Clamps","Circuit breakers","Current

reactance. By reducing the voltage blocking requirement of the semiconductors, the neutral point clamped variant of the coupled inductor inverter topology (NPC-CI) is more suited to high DC bus voltages, and features a significant reduction in magnetic material required over six-switch coupled inductor inverters. This paper describes the operational and design techniques for the NPC-CI inverter. A simple continuous PWM technique for operation with a three-limb core is presented and the specific design challenges involved in the NPC-CI inverter are highlighted: designing the three-limb coupled inductor, the natural balancing action of the split-dc link, semiconductor stresses, inverter construction and practical considerations for inverter operation of the drive. Machine performance is then illustrated on an unloaded 18,000 rpm 15HP induction machine to emphasize the harmonic quality improvement, and on a loaded 2HP utility speed induction machine to demonstrate transient performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617878/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5617878/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628537","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A five/nine-level twelve-switch neutral point clamped inverter for high speed electric drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A five/nine-level twelve-switch neutral point clamped inverter for high speed electric drives","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"3380315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071234S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5617886,"authors":[{"name":"Dawei Xiang","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, University of Durham, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Dawei","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37392666000"},{"name":"Li Ran","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, University of Durham, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Ran","id":"37272888900"},{"name":"Peter Tavner","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, University of Durham, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Tavner","id":"37267498700"},{"name":"Shaoyong Yang","affiliation":["School of Engineering University of Warwick, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Shaoyong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37405307400"},{"name":"Angus Bryant","affiliation":["School of Engineering University of Warwick, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Angus","lastName":"Bryant","id":"37267564900"},{"name":"Philip Mawby","affiliation":["School of Engineering University of Warwick, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Mawby","id":"38543870400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5617886","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":357},"abstract":"Condition monitoring is desired by power electronic system designers as a cost effective means of improving reliability. This paper presents a method to monitor solder fatigue inside a power module by identifying internal thermal resistance increases due to solder fatigue, taking account of the masking effects of a variable operating condition. It is assumed that the total power loss increases as junction temperature rises, causing an increase in the case temperature above ambient, which can be measured. A dynamic thermal model of the heat sink is established, to estimate power loss by measurement, while a device power loss model is developed to estimate internal thermal resistance by further considering the converter electrical loading. Experiment and simulation using validated models are used to characterise the proposed method and verify the concept.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05617886.pdf","startPage":"955","endPage":"962","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monitoring solder fatigue in a power module using the rise of case-above-ambient temperature","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature measurement","Fatigue","Thermal resistance","Junctions","Heat sinks","Temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","fatigue","heat sinks","modules","power convertors","power electronics","reliability","solders","thermal resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["solder fatigue monitoring","power module","case-above-ambient temperature","condition monitoring","power electronic system","internal thermal resistance","masking effects","total power loss estimation","dynamic thermal model","heat sink","converter electrical loading"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Condition monitoring","Power electronics","Reliability","Solder fatigue","Temperature measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Monitoring solder fatigue in a power module using the rise of case-above-ambient temperature","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617886/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628544","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monitoring solder fatigue in a power module using the rise of case-above-ambient temperature","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"1370254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057362S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5617901,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Hwan Lee","affiliation":["WEMPEC, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Seung-Hwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37600738500"},{"name":"Robert D.

Simulations show that this low-complexity method is well suited for stationary or non-stationary behavior.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Demodulation","Induction motors","Stators","Generators","Transforms","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","condition monitoring","fault diagnosis","stators","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","wind turbines","wind energy conversion systems","amplitude demodulation","renewable energy sources","operational cost","maintenance cost","fault diagnostics","three-phase stator current"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wind turbine","Fault Detection","Bearings","Signal Processing","Amplitude Modulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617914","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05617914.pdf","startPage":"2417","endPage":"2421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Condition monitoring of wind turbines based on amplitude demodulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Condition monitoring of wind turbines based on amplitude demodulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617914/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617914/","accessionNumber":"11628572","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Condition monitoring of wind turbines based on amplitude demodulation","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"3500822.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063543S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5617921,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph Song-Manguelle","affiliation":["GE Global Research Center, Niskayuna, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Song-Manguelle","id":"38273580700"},{"name":"Christof Sihler","affiliation":["GE Global Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Christof","lastName":"Sihler","id":"38303473900"},{"name":"Simon Schramm","affiliation":["GE Global Research Center, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Schramm","id":"38272058300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5617921","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Shafts","Generators","Damping","Harmonic analysis","Synchronous motors","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air gaps","failure analysis","motor drives","power capacitors","PWM invertors","rectifying circuits","shafts","variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping torsional resonance mode approach","load-commutated inverters","reliability","rectifier","weakly connected power systems","offshore oil","gas platforms","accelerated shaft fatigue","lifetime reduction","gear damage",", pulse width modulated voltage source inverters","VSI","torque ripple","mechanical shaft systems","mechanical failures","motor air gap torques","pulse-width-modulated drives","torsional vibration","DC-link inductance","integrated energy storage unit","generator interactions","motor interactions","excited eigenmodes","variable speed motor","LCI system","DC-link capacitor","power 30 MW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Airgap Torque","High-Power","LCI","LNG","Mechanical Resonance","Pulsating Torque","PWM","Torsional Vibration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617921","abstract":"In large drive applications load-commutated inverters (LCIs) are one of the most used technologies, mainly because of their excellent reliability records. However, LCIs are known to generate interharmonics. They can interact with the mechanical system at torsional natural torsional frequencies of the rotating train, both on the inverter and on rectifier side in weakly connected power systems, such as offshore oil and gas platforms. These interactions can lead to accelerated shaft fatigue, lifetime reduction, gear damage and system blackouts. On the other hand, pulse width modulated voltage source inverters (VSIs) are known to produce less torque ripple compared to LCIs. Consequently, VSIs are supposed to be less subject to exciting torsional resonances in mechanical shaft systems. Even with reduced torque ripple, mechanical failures have been consistently reported due to motor air gap torques supplied by pulse-width-modulated drives. This paper is focused on solving torsional vibration issues. Due to system uncertainties, these issues cannot be excluded in the design phase of LCI and VSI for high-power applications. With regard to LCIs, the DC-link inductance is used as an integrated energy storage unit. Motor and generator interactions are therefore decoupled. Excited eigenmodes on the grid side are damped with the rectifier; the inverter is driving the variable speed motor. This approach is also successfully applied to damping resonance modes in the motor side. Simulation and selected experimental results on a 30 MW LCI system are provided to validate the proposed design approach. As for VSIs, a more general approach of damping or controlling excited shafts is proposed. This method is successfully applied using the DC-link capacitor as integrated energy storage source. This approach is used to optimize the design of new systems, otherwise to improve performance of existing systems with minor modifications.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617921","startPage":"772","endPage":"779","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05617921.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general approach of damping torsional resonance modes in multi-megawatt applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A general approach of damping torsional resonance modes in multi-megawatt applications","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617921/","accessionNumber":"11628579","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617921/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general approach of damping torsional resonance modes in multi-megawatt applications","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"1120412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056579S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5617927,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Gerrits","affiliation":["Eindhovan University of Technology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Gerrits","id":"37063711400"},{"name":"Jorge L.

Improved topologies and semiconductors can allow for lower loss at higher frequencies. A major barrier to further improvement is the transformer design. With high current levels and high frequency effects the transformers can become the major loss component in the circuit. High values of transformer leakage inductance can also greatly degrade the performance of the converter. Matrix transformers offer the ability to reduce winding loss and leakage inductance. This paper will study the use of matrix transformers for a 600-W, 12-V/50A bus converter and identify the optimal number of matrix transformers. This paper will also propose an improved integrated matrix transformer design that can decrease core loss and further improve the performance of matrix transformers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05617929.pdf","startPage":"2446","endPage":"2450","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617929","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High frequency bus converter with integrated matrix transformers for CPU and telecommunications applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductance","Windings","Resistance","Matrix converters","Transformer cores","Core loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power convertors","power transformers","telecommunication power supplies","transformer windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high frequency bus converter","integrated matrix transformers","intermediate bus architectures","transformer leakage inductance","winding loss reduction","power 600 W","voltage 12 V","current 50 A"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bus converter","integrated magnetics","leakage inductance","matrix transformer","winding resistance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"High frequency bus converter with integrated matrix transformers for CPU and telecommunications applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617929/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628587","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High frequency bus converter with integrated matrix transformers for CPU and telecommunications applications","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"3550083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06728S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5617936,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Tse Lee","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Power Technologies, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Tse","lastName":"Lee","id":"37599680900"},{"name":"Chia-Chi Chu","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Power Technologies, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Chi","lastName":"Chu","id":"37277309200"},{"name":"Po-Tai Cheng","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Power Technologies, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Tai","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37270180600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5617936","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1683},"abstract":"Microgrid is widely accepted as an effective mean of integrating various distributed energy resources (DERs) through their interface converters to provide electric power of high quality and reliability. These distributed resources interface converters (DICs) are required to operate in an autonomous fashion without any communication for enhanced reliability. Conventionally, the real power-frequency droop control and the reactive power-voltage droop are adopted as the de-centralized control strategies in these DICs for the autonomous power sharing operations. However, the reactive power sharing of Q-V droop control often deteriorates if there are mismatched transmission line impedance characteristics. In this paper, a Q-V dot droop control method with V dot restoration mechanism is proposed to improve the sharing of reactive power. Its operation principle and control method are explained and analyzed. In addition, simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05617936.pdf","startPage":"702","endPage":"709","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new droop control method for the autonomous operation of distributed energy resource interface converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Power transmission lines","Voltage control","Mathematical model","Equations","Simulation","Converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power convertors","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed energy resource interface converter","power frequency droop control","transmission line impedance characteristic","reactive power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed generation systems","droop control","Microgrid"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A new droop control method for the autonomous operation of distributed energy resource interface converters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617936/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628593","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new droop control method for the autonomous operation of distributed energy resource interface converters","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"1020507.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060024S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5617945,"authors":[{"name":"W.X.

In this paper, a new automated approach for testing inverter-fed induction machines for airgap eccentricity is proposed. The main concept is to use the inverter to excite the machine with a pulsating field at multiple angular positions to observe the variation of equivalent impedance due to eccentricity, whenever the motor is stopped. It is shown that the increase in the value of the equivalent (leakage) inductance under standstill excitation can be used as an indicator of increasing airgap eccentricity. Standstill testing can provide reliable assessment of eccentricity that is independent of variations in operating conditions, load interferences, or motor type. An experimental study on a 7.5hp induction motor verifies that eccentricity can be detected with high sensitivity and reliability without additional hardware.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated monitoring of airgap eccentricity for inverterfed induction motors under standstill conditions","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617947","startPage":"2485","endPage":"2492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05617947.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Automated monitoring of airgap eccentricity for inverterfed induction motors under standstill conditions","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617947/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628604","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated monitoring of airgap eccentricity for inverterfed induction motors under standstill conditions","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"3610245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071327S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5617948,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Huh","affiliation":["Department of EE, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Huh","id":"37530110200"},{"name":"Sungwoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of EE, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sungwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37539840300"},{"name":"Changbyung Park","affiliation":["Department of EE, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Changbyung","lastName":"Park","id":"37596378600"},{"name":"Gyu-Hyeoung Cho","affiliation":["Department of EE, KAIST, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gyu-Hyeoung","lastName":"Cho","id":"37349893000"},{"name":"Chun-Taek Rim","affiliation":["Department of Nuclear & Quantum Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chun-Taek","lastName":"Rim","id":"37443010100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5617948","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":93,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":2153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rails","Air gaps","Magnetic cores","Power supplies","Roads","Power generation","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air gaps","electric vehicles","inductive power transmission","invertors","magnetic flux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance inductive power transfer system","narrow rail width","on-line electric vehicles","air-gap","magnetic flux","power supply inverter","size 10 cm","voltage 440 V","frequency 20 kHz","power 35 kW","efficiency 74 percent","power 27 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inductive power transfer system","contactless power system","wireless power transfer"]}],"abstract":"A new inductive power transfer system (IPTS) with narrow rail width and large air-gap for electric vehicle (EV) is proposed in this paper.

Hence, the proposed IPTS with narrow rail width, 10 cm, and large air-gap, up to 20 cm, can be implemented for EV. The power supply inverter uses 440 V, 3phase input and supplies 20 kHz output current. To null the high voltages of power rail and pick-up and to transfer maximum power to vehicles, resonant capacitors are inserted to each side of the rail and the pick-up. The test results show that the maximum output power is 35 kW and the maximum efficiency is 74% at 27 kW output. The proposed IPTS is found to be adequate for EV which can freely drive on the road by picking up the power from the underground power supply rail.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance inductive power transfer system with narrow rail width for On-Line Electric Vehicles","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617948","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05617948.pdf","startPage":"647","endPage":"651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617948","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"High performance inductive power transfer system with narrow rail width for On-Line Electric Vehicles","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617948/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628605","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance inductive power transfer system with narrow rail width for On-Line Electric Vehicles","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0940629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066728S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617948","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5617960,"authors":[{"name":"Faete Filho","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Faete","lastName":"Filho","id":"37392605600"},{"name":"Leon M.

Conventional PLL schemes used in DG controller have to compromise between steady-state accuracy and transient dynamics when grid voltage is polluted by unbalance and harmonics. To simultaneously realize good steady-state and transient performances, this paper proposes a general delayed signal cancellation (DSC) operator, which can be tailored to eliminate any specified harmonic. The proposed DSC operator can be further cascaded to stepwisely reject all undesired harmonics. Then the conditioned voltage signal can be used in PLL loop to achieve fast transient response at high control bandwidth without suffering from the steady-state error caused by harmonics. Based on differently configured DSC operators, two PLL designs are then developed, namely CDSC-PLL1 and CDSC-PLL2. Specifically, CDSC-PLL1 is aimed for grid voltage with unbalance and odd/even harmonics, while CDSC-PLL2 further addresses asymmetrical harmonics, i.e. harmonics arising from asymmetrically distorted three-phase voltages. All proposed PLL designs have very simple structure and can be easily implemented. The superior performance is confirmed by experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617996","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05617996.pdf","startPage":"420","endPage":"427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5617996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grid synchronization PLL based on cascaded delayed signal cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5617996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5617996/","displayDocTitle":"Grid synchronization PLL based on cascaded delayed signal cancellation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628653","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5617996/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grid synchronization PLL based on cascaded delayed signal cancellation","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0620574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082499S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5617996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5618000,"authors":[{"name":"Xiong Fang","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong Univ., Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiong","lastName":"Fang","id":"37403351700"},{"name":"Yue Wang","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong Univ., Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281447000"},{"name":"Ming Li","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong Univ., Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Li","id":"37089088498"},{"name":"Jinjun Liu","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong Univ., Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jinjun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279465300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5618000","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":770},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase locked loops","Harmonic analysis","Power harmonic filters","Harmonic distortion","Steady-state","Phase frequency detector","Phase distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonic distortion","phase locked loops","power convertors","power grids","power system interconnection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency adaptive PLL","grid-connected converters","phase locked loop","rotating reference frame","harmonics distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency-adaptive","Grid-connected converters","Harmonic distortion","Phase-locked loop (PLL)","Single-phase","Synthesis circuit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618000","abstract":"This paper presents a novel frequency-adaptive Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for single-phase grid-connected power converters.

Specifically, it is found that there is an inherent damping term embedded in the feedback loop when converter current is used for implementing closed-loop control. This additional damping term can indeed neutralize the resonance introduced by LCL-filters, and thus giving rise to a more stable system than that of grid current feedback control. In this case, only one set of current sensors is required to stabilize the system, doing away with passive damping, active damping or complex state observer. Theoretical analysis is then presented and lead to a general design guideline, which suggests a way of choosing the values of grid- and converter-side inductors, so that optimum damping can be naturally achieved by solely using converter current control. In the case when this design criterion is not fulfilled, a simple compensation method is also proposed to tune the damping factor. Both simulation and experimental results are finally provided to validate the theoretical findings developed in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and

In this new method the number of prime variables that define the optimization is reduced to only six. A canonical Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method with penalty function for design constraints is developed to find the optimal solution for a user defined objective function. After several trial solutions with the PSO, the optimal regions for both the design variables and the performance indexes can be estimated. The results will provide useful information for both a drive system designer and a machine designer at an early stage of the design process. A comparison study of PSO and Genetic Algorithm (GA) is also performed in this paper and the comparison shows that PSO is more successful in finding the global optima and also has better computational efficiency than GA.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618027","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618027.pdf","startPage":"284","endPage":"291","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel method for multi-objective design and optimization of three phase induction machines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A novel method for multi-objective design and optimization of three phase induction machines","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11628682","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5618027/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel method for multi-objective design and optimization of three phase induction machines","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0431016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066378S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5618033,"authors":[{"name":"Weiyi Feng","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Weiyi","lastName":"Feng","id":"37599188200"},{"name":"Daocheng Huang","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Daocheng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37593973500"},{"name":"Paolo Mattavelli","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Mattavelli","id":"37275807000"},{"name":"Dianbo Fu","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Dianbo","lastName":"Fu","id":"37271411300"},{"name":"Fred C.

The current design process being used by package designers involves a sequential procedure instead of a simultaneous process. Each design step involves the analysis of the thermal, electrical or mechanical aspects of the design. As a result, the designer has to iterate between the various design process steps in order to achieve an optimal design. This causes a substantial increase in the design cycle time. A new methodology has been developed and implemented in this work that helps to automate and optimize the PEM design process. Power-CAD uses an electrothermal simulation methodology, a parasitic extraction tool, and an optimization algorithm that helps to achieve an optimal layout for a discrete PEM. This approach promises to save time and money for the PEM design industry by significantly reducing the number of design cycles.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618043.pdf","startPage":"2692","endPage":"2699","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618043","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-CAD: A novel methodology for design, analysis and optimization of Power Electronic Module layouts","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Solid modeling","Optimization","Mathematical model","Electronic packaging thermal management","Integrated circuit modeling","Thermal analysis","Power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit layout CAD","electronic engineering computing","electronics packaging","modules","power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power CAD","power electronic module layouts","optimal layout","package designer","electrothermal simulation methodology","parasitic extraction tool","optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["computer-aided design (CAD)","design automation","electrothermal analysis","power electronic modules (PEM)","optimization methods","electronic packaging","power electronics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618043/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Power-CAD: A novel methodology for design, analysis and optimization of Power Electronic Module layouts","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618043/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628698","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-CAD: A novel methodology for design, analysis and optimization of Power Electronic Module layouts","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"3930476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035677S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5618044,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Geyer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Geyer","id":"37391100100"},{"name":"Giovanni A.

Specifically, with respect to standard DTC, the converter's switching frequency and/or losses are considerably reduced, while at the same time the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) levels of the phase currents and the torque are improved. Moreover, DTC's favorable dynamic and robustness properties are preserved. This paper presents an MPDTC scheme for a permanent magnet synchronous motor that achieves long prediction horizons in the range of up to 150 time-steps through the use of extrapolation and bounds. A discrete-time internal controller model of the drive system is derived from the physical equations. Simulation results for a three-level voltage source inverter indicate that such an MPDTC scheme, compared to an industry standard controller, is capable of reducing the switching losses and the switching frequency by up to 50%, and the torque THD by 25%, while leaving the current THD unchanged.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618044","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618044.pdf","startPage":"199","endPage":"206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Direct Torque Control of permanent magnet synchronous motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618044/","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Direct Torque Control of permanent magnet synchronous motors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628699","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618044/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Direct Torque Control of permanent magnet synchronous motors","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"0300808.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083588S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618044","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5618050,"authors":[{"name":"Arnold Wilkins","affiliation":["Department of Psychology, University of Essex, UK"],"firstName":"Arnold","lastName":"Wilkins","id":"37597405600"},{"name":"Jennifer Veitch","affiliation":["National Research Council Canada, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Jennifer","lastName":"Veitch","id":"37597429800"},{"name":"Brad Lehman","affiliation":["Department Electrical & Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, USA"],"firstName":"Brad","lastName":"Lehman","id":"37276071100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5618050","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":166,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":4389},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Frequency modulation","Lighting","Visualization","Humans"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brightness","health and safety","IEEE standards","LED lamps","vision defects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LED lighting flicker","potential health concerns","IEEE standard PAR1789","biological human response"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LED","health risk","flicker","lighting","power electronics","ergonomics","drivers","headache","seizure","standards"]}],"abstract":"The IEEE Standards Working Group, IEEE PAR1789 \u201cRecommending practices for modulating current in High Brightness LEDs for mitigating health risks to viewers\u201d has been formed to advise the lighting industry, ANSI/NEMA, IEC, EnergyStar and other standards groups about the emerging concern of flicker in LED lighting.

Specifically, based on the multivariable generalized Nyquist stability criterion developed by MacFarlane and Postlethwaite, this paper shows how the fundamental stability problem at such ac interface is indeed reduced to a single-input single-output (SISO) case. It is shown that the ac stability is fully determined by the SISO return-ratio of the d-d channel-or the power transfer channel of the desired d-q frame alignment; that is, the stability is determined by the d-d channel input and output impedances. Correspondingly, it is shown that the q-q channel trajectory on the complex plane is such that it cannot encircle the critical point (-1+j0) and therefore be the cause of instability. The ac stability at the input terminals of the rectifier can then be fully assessed using the standard SISO Nyquist stability theorem, in sheer duality of Middlebrook's criterion for dc-dc converters.

The optimization goal is to maximize the transferred power, while limiting the number of compensation components to no more than two reactive components. Additionally, VA limits of the inverter are taken into consideration. Current track requirements are relaxed and instead of constant track current, small track load dependency is allowed, which is acceptable in practice. The theoretical investigations and calculations, as well as simulations for two important practical cases considered are presented in the paper. It is shown that LC compensation structure allows maximum delivered power, but not for the case when the impedances of compensation elements are the same as it would be expected. Additionally, the impact of converter ratings and allowed load dependent track current variation on the optimal design are investigated through the set of numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618093","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618093.pdf","startPage":"1602","endPage":"1609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal resonant tank design considerations for primary track compensation in Inductive Power Transfer systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618093","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618093/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal resonant tank design considerations for primary track compensation in Inductive Power Transfer systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628746","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618093/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal resonant tank design considerations for primary track compensation in Inductive Power Transfer systems","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"2301152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065955S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5618098,"authors":[{"name":"Chirag Desai","affiliation":["Power and Energy Research (PEER) Group, P.

However, in order to provide the vehicle with the required tolerance to lateral movement, bulky pickups or complex track arrangements are required. The challenge is to provide the vehicle as much freedom of movement as possible so that drivers are not artificially restricted, while utilizing a simple and low cost pickup, track and power supply. This paper will show that a simple, low cost two-phase track and power supply system can provide similar benefits to a more complex three-phase system, while also lowering the system cost with a simpler installation. A quadrature pickup provides additional benefits in maintaining a constant power transfer across the width of the roadway. Used together, these provide the vehicle with high freedom of movement, and a low total system cost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A practical multiphase IPT system for AGV and roadway applications","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618146","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618146.pdf","startPage":"1844","endPage":"1850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618146","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A practical multiphase IPT system for AGV and roadway applications","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618146/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628835","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical multiphase IPT system for AGV and roadway applications","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"2650589.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080437S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5618172,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Geyer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Geyer","id":"37391100100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5618172","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":498},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Switching loss","Inverters","Torque","Pulse width modulation","Stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric drives","electric machines","harmonic distortion","machine vector control","predictive control","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medium-voltage drives","predictive control","field oriented control","modulation schemes","electrical drives","switched three-phase voltage waveforms","electrical machine","switching losses","inverter","harmonic distortions","stator currents","pulse width modulation","characteristic hyperbolic trade-off functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Control and modulation schemes","model predictive control","pulse width modulation","optimized pulse patterns","medium-voltage drives","performance trade-off","benchmarking"]}],"abstract":"Control and modulation schemes for electrical drives synthesize switched three-phase voltage waveforms that control the electrical machine. Particularly in medium-voltage applications, the aim is to minimize both the switching losses in the inverter as well as the harmonic distortions of the stator currents and the torque. For a given modulation scheme, lower switching losses usually imply higher distortion factors and vice versa. As shown in this paper, for pulse width modulation, this trade-off can be described by a hyperbolic function. Predictive control concepts are rapidly emerging. Their characteristic hyperbolic trade-off functions are derived and compared with each other and with the one of pulse width modulation. It is shown that predictive schemes with long prediction horizons shift the trade-off point towards the origin thus lowering both the switching losses and the harmonic distortions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of control and modulation schemes for medium-voltage drives: Emerging predictive control concepts versus Field Oriented Control","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618172","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618172.pdf","startPage":"2836","endPage":"2843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of control and modulation schemes for medium-voltage drives: Emerging predictive control concepts versus Field Oriented Control","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618172/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628868","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of control and modulation schemes for medium-voltage drives: Emerging predictive control concepts versus Field Oriented Control","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4130093.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082921S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5618176,"authors":[{"name":"S.

To achieve communicationless control among DG interfacing converters, virtual impedances are placed between the interfacing converter outputs and the grid to improve system stability and mitigate coupling between real and reactive power. In order to properly design the virtual impedance, small-signal models of a microgrid in different operation modes are developed using complex number matrix, which is flexible and can be easily extended when more DG units are added. Based on the developed microgrid models, system damping and stability are evaluated. Together with the DG power capacity and power decoupling requirements, the desired DG output virtual impedance can be designed. To realize the virtual impedance, a robust implementation method that avoids using of any high/low pass filters is presented. Moreover, to further improve the power control performance during transients, a transient power decoupling algorithm and an adaptive transient impedance control scheme are proposed. Experimental results are provided to validate the impedance design approach, the virtual impedance implementation method and the proposed transient power control strategies.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618181.pdf","startPage":"2857","endPage":"2864","publicationTitle":"2010

Compared to a classic PV system, an additional bidirectional DC/DC-converter is required to ensure the charge and discharge of the battery. The power management of the system can be controlled by the grid operator or according to the best profit defined in a feed-in tariff law for renewable energy. Special attention has to be paid to the efficiency of this DC/DC-converter, due to the bidirectional energy passing before a grid injection is possible in case of energy buffering.

Carbon-doped GeTe, named GeTeC, remarkably lowers the RESET current and features very good data retention properties as well. In particular, GeTe PCM with 10% carbon inclusions (named GeTeC10%) yields about 30% of RESET current reduction with respect to pure GeTe and GST. Furthermore, our GeTeC10% memory cells are expected to guarantee a 10-years-lifetime-temperature of about 127\u00b0C, which is one of the highest ever reported for PCM. The outstanding properties of GeTeC make this material promising for non-volatile memory technologies.","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2010.5618230","publicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the European Solid State Device Research Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the European Solid State Device Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609035/5617713/05618230.pdf","startPage":"313","endPage":"316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2010.5618230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carbon-doped GeTe Phase-Change Memory featuring remarkable RESET current reduction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Carbon-doped GeTe Phase-Change Memory featuring remarkable RESET current reduction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11626349","htmlLink":"/document/5618230/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carbon-doped GeTe Phase-Change Memory featuring remarkable RESET current reduction","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"D0654310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087377S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609035","isNumber":"5617713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609035","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5617713","articleId":"5618230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5618231,"authors":[{"name":"Domenico Ventrice","affiliation":["Numonyx Technology Development, Agrate-Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Ventrice","id":"37601317100"},{"name":"Alessandro Calderoni","affiliation":["Numonyx Technology Development, Agrate-Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Calderoni","id":"37396467500"},{"name":"Paolo Fantini","affiliation":["Numonyx Technology Development, Agrate-Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Fantini","id":"37268164600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6661-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6658-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6660-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-6558"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8876"},{"format":"CD","value":"1930-8876"}],"articleNumber":"5618231","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618231","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Arrays","Phase change materials","Current distribution","Resistance","Programming","Heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar transistors","current distribution","decoding","Monte Carlo methods","nanotechnology","phase change memories","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase change memory","BJT-based decoding array","current distributions","mainstream memories","storage cells decoding","programming current","nanotechnology","readout condition","programming condition","SPICE","Monte Carlo simulations","size 45 nm"]}],"abstract":"Phase Change Memory (PCM) is today demonstrating to be one of the mainstream memories for the next decade.

The proposed control strategy provides high voltage gain without using high frequency transformer, which contributes to weigh and size reduction of the proposed DC-AC converter structure. Theoretical analysis are presented and corroborated by experimental results of a 180W laboratory prototype.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618262","startPage":"2121","endPage":"2126","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618262.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New control strategy applied to a CSI inverter with amplified sinusoidal output voltage: Analysis, simulation and experimental results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"New control strategy applied to a CSI inverter with amplified sinusoidal output voltage: Analysis, simulation and experimental results","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618262/","accessionNumber":"11628949","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618262/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New control strategy applied to a CSI inverter with amplified sinusoidal output voltage: Analysis, simulation and experimental results","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"3070271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072977S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5618267,"authors":[{"name":"Mihail V.

The main focus is on a theoretical investigation of the conduction losses of such a converter and a comparison to a corresponding converter with silicon insulated gate bipolar transistors. Both SiC BJTs and JFETs are considered and compared in order to choose the most suitable technology. One of the sub-modules of a down-scaled 10 kVA prototype M2C is replaced with a sub-module with SiC JFETs without anti-parallel diodes. It is shown that diode-less operation is possible with the JFETs conducting in the negative direction, leaving the possibility to use the body diode during the switching transients. Experimental waveforms for the SiC sub-module verify the feasibility during normal steady-state operation. The loss estimation shows that a 300 MW M2C for high-voltage direct current transmission would potentially have an efficiency of approximately 99,8 % if equipped with future 3.3 kV 1.2 kA SiC JFETs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618274.pdf","startPage":"2148","endPage":"2155","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-power modular multilevel converters with SiC JFETs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon carbide","JFETs","Converters","Silicon","Capacitors","MOSFETs","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC power transmission","insulated gate bipolar transistors","junction gate field effect transistors","silicon compounds","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-power modular multilevel converters","JFET","conduction losses","silicon insulated gate bipolar transistors","loss estimation","high-voltage direct current transmission","power 300 MW","SiC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Silicon Carbide","Modular Multilevel Converter","SiC JFETs","Diode-less operation","High Voltage Direct-Current Transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"High-power modular multilevel converters with SiC JFETs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618274/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628960","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-power modular multilevel converters with SiC JFETs","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"3110909.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099619S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5618280,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Li","affiliation":["Institute of Power Electronics, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Li","id":"37292663200"},{"name":"Zhiyuan Ma","affiliation":["Institute of Power Electronics, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37593360600"},{"name":"Dehong Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Power Electronics, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Dehong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278438200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5618280","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":523},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618280","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Inverters","Zero voltage switching","Clamps","Inductors","Capacitors","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","invertors","power grids","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSP controlled active clamping zero voltage switching","SVM controlled three-phase grid connected inverter","ZVS operation","antiparallel diode reverse recovery current","space vector modulation","switching frequency","switching voltage stress","power switching device","DC link voltage","ZVS inverter","independent loads"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Three-phase inverter","Space vector modulation (SVM)","soft switching","Zero voltage switching","Grid connected","Unbalanced Grid condition"]}],"abstract":"A novel active clamping zero voltage switching SVM controlled three-phase grid connected inverter is proposed in this paper.

The module is physically connected across the lamp tube that requires dimming. The operating concept is based on diverting the current being supplied to the lamp tube away from the lamp tube thereby dimming the lamp. The power stage of the module is a series resonant inverter operating as a reactive power controller. It is controlled to draw a current in phase quadrature with the lamp voltage. On dimming the lamp, it will increase the filament voltage so as to maintain thermal emission of electrons from the filament, without detriment to the input power quality of the ballast and lamp current crest factor. An experimental prototype for a 28W T5 lamp has been built and evaluated. It is applied to one of the two lamps that are both ballasted by commercial electronic ballast. Experimental results show that the power supply to the lamp with the dimming module connected can be reduced by 70% while the one without the dimming module remains unchanged. A comprehensive study into the electrical performance of the ballast, lamp operational characteristics and system efficiency at different dimmed conditions will be presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic ballasts","Inverters","RLC circuits","Capacitors","Prototypes","Fluorescent lamps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fluorescent lamps","lamp accessories","reactive power control","resonant invertors","resonant power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dimming module","fluorescent lamp","nondimmable electronic ballast","active power supply","lamp tube","power stage","series resonant inverter","reactive power controller","current in phase quadrature","lamp voltage","filament voltage","thermal emission","input power quality","lamp current crest factor","T5 lamp","commercial electronic ballast","electrical performance","lamp operational characteristics","system efficiency","dimmed conditions","power 28 W"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electronic ballast","lighting technology","dimming technique"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618281","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618281.pdf","startPage":"1327","endPage":"1334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dimming module for controlling power supply to a fluorescent lamp ballasted by a nondimmable electronic ballast","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A dimming module for controlling power supply to a fluorescent lamp ballasted by a nondimmable electronic ballast","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618281/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618281/","accessionNumber":"11628966","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dimming module for controlling power supply to a fluorescent lamp ballasted by a nondimmable electronic ballast","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"1900479.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088222S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5618310,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The paper is focused on the rotor design, that is the most controversial aspect of IPM design due to the difficult modeling dominated by magnetic saturation. Three original results are presented: the elimination of higher order torque ripple harmonics and the minimization of FEA evaluations by means of a random rotor position offset and the evaluation, by means of the same static FEA runs, of the eddy current losses in the rotor core.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618310/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11628993","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618310/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FEA-based multi-objective optimization of IPM motor design including rotor losses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FEA-based multi-objective optimization of IPM motor design including rotor losses","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"5331208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084197S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5618318,"authors":[{"name":"David G.

An induction motor and switched reluctance motor are studied. Torque over a wide speed range is required (base speed of 1500 rpm and maximum speed of 6000 rpm) and the total torque per volume is used as a key marker indicator. The efficiency is studied and efficiency plots are introduced; predicted losses are used to investigate thermal conditions and temperature rise, which affect the machines described in the paper. Results indicate that at 1500 rpm very high current density exists in all the machines whilst at 6000 rpm the iron loss dominates. The paper illustrates that the permanent magnet motor is not the sole solution to specifying a drive motor for this application.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618318","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618318.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618318","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","startPage":"3352","endPage":"3359","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of different motor design drives for hybrid electric vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618318","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of different motor design drives for hybrid electric vehicles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618318/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618318/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11629000","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of different motor design drives for hybrid electric vehicles","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"4890347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055967S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5618331,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Islam","affiliation":["Nexteer Automotive, Saginaw, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Islam","id":"38636249500"},{"name":"Rakib Islam","affiliation":["Nexteer Automotive, Saginaw, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Rakib","lastName":"Islam","id":"37529934200"},{"name":"Tomy Sebastian","affiliation":["Nexteer Automotive, Saginaw, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Tomy","lastName":"Sebastian","id":"37266880900"},{"name":"Ashok Chandy","affiliation":["Nexteer Automotive, Saginaw, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Ashok","lastName":"Chandy","id":"37589264400"},{"name":"Suat Ozsoylu","affiliation":["Nexteer Automotive, Saginaw, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Suat","lastName":"Ozsoylu","id":"37599973400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5618331","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"abstract":"Cogging torque minimization is necessary for low torque ripple applications such as precision tooling, robotics etc. Various techniques are available but few techniques are proved to be effective in mass production under manufacturing tolerances/variations. The research provides a design approach to minimize cogging torque by making the motor robust to manufacturing variations and dimensional tolerances. Several control and noise factors are identified to apply the robust design technique. The quality of robustness is judged by the signal-to-noise ratio. A trade-off is exercised to maximize output torque in selecting the control parameters. The research shows the effectiveness of such design techniques in designing motors for mass production without adding cost or complexity. Experimentation by modeling has been chosen using finite element analysis. Motors using the optimized parameters are built and tested thus verifying the design approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Forging","Noise","Robustness","Arrays","Rotors","Stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brushless DC motors","DC motor drives","finite element analysis","permanent magnet motors","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cogging torque minimization","permanent magnet motor","robust design","low torque ripple application","mass production","finite element analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618331","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618331.pdf","startPage":"3803","endPage":"3810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cogging torque minimization in PM motors using robust design approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cogging torque minimization in PM motors using robust design approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618331/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618331/","accessionNumber":"11629013","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cogging torque minimization in PM motors using robust design approach","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"5531227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061014S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5618342,"authors":[{"name":"Takumi Ito","affiliation":["Chiba University, Inage, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Takumi","lastName":"Ito","id":"37593573700"},{"name":"Masamu Kamaga","affiliation":["Chiba University, Inage, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Masamu","lastName":"Kamaga","id":"37601294900"},{"name":"Yukihiko Sato","affiliation":["Chiba University, Inage, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Yukihiko","lastName":"Sato","id":"37276345200"},{"name":"Hiromichi Ohashi","affiliation":["Industrial Science and Technology, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromichi","lastName":"Ohashi","id":"37281621700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5618342","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":561},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Inverters","Converters","Power harmonic filters","Switches","RLC circuits","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitor switching","electromagnetic interference","heat sinks","resonant power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonant switched capacitor converter","voltage balancing circuit","DC capacitors","diode-clamped multilevel inverters","output power density converters","power converters","electromagnetic interference","heat sinks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power converter","output power density","diode-clamped multilevel inverter","voltage balancing circuit","resonant switched capacitor converter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618342","abstract":"Output power density of power converters has been increasing. At the same time, the power converters with lower harmonics and lower electromagnetic interference are required in many applications. To satisfy these requirements, the volume of filters and heat sinks should be reduced. As a solution to realize higher output power density and lower harmonics, diode-clamped multilevel inverters are investigated. In this case, the voltage balancing circuit must be connected to the DC capacitors because the DC voltages tend to unbalance when the number of the output level exceeds three. Therefore, the total volume of the converters including the voltage balancing circuit should be investigated.

When the load transient frequency approaches to the switching frequency of VR, there is a low frequency oscillation in the system, which is the beat frequency oscillation between the load transient frequency and the switching frequency of VR. When this low frequency oscillation becomes significant, the system may be hurt. The root cause of this beat frequency oscillation is constant frequency operation of the VR. In order to resolve this problem, Ramp Pulse Modulation (RPM) method is proposed.

Amongst the various effects used to program the cell, this study is focused on the Impact Ionization (II), the most common mechanism to store charges in the body of the cell, and the Meta-Stable Dip (MSD) effect. Dynamic measurements are presented showing the impact of the gate length reduction on both the II and the MSD programming mechanisms. It is found that MSD is less impacted by the scaling of standard SOI MOSFETs without specific optimization. Those attractive performances result from the dynamic coupling between the front and back gates in Fully Depleted SOI (FDSOI) transistors.","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2010.5618427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2010.5618427","publicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the European Solid State Device Research Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the European Solid State Device Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609035/5617713/05618427.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Experimental comparison of programming mechanisms in 1T-DRAM cells with variable channel length","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11626323","htmlLink":"/document/5618427/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental comparison of programming mechanisms in 1T-DRAM cells with variable channel length","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"D0254305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056727S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609035","isNumber":"5617713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609035","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5617713","articleId":"5618427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5618428,"authors":[{"name":"N.

While the impact of static NBTI is well examined for cells and arrays, the fast-recovering component was not yet measured on SRAM arrays. The novel method presented here analyzes the flipping of cells directly after the supply voltage was lowered to a specific value where the structure is most sensitive for NBTI induced cell flips. Thus, read margin criterion is used to characterize the decreasing cell stability due to NBTI degradation with a resolution down to 1 ms. Applying this method, the impact of static and dynamic NBTI is measured in a 65 nm low power CMOS technology. Between 1 ms and 10.000 s after stress, the NBTI induced number of cell flips decreases by almost one half.","publicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the European Solid State Device Research Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the European Solid State Device Research Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609035/5617713/05618438.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2010.5618438","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2010.5618438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617713","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of fast-recovering NBTI degradation on stability of large-scale SRAM arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Impact of fast-recovering NBTI degradation on stability of large-scale SRAM arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618438/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5618438/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11626326","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of fast-recovering NBTI degradation on stability of large-scale SRAM arrays","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"D0244267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043435S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609035","isNumber":"5617713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609035","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5617713","articleId":"5618438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5618441,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaomeng Cheng","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaomeng","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37288436900"},{"name":"Haifeng Lu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Haifeng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37289422900"},{"name":"Wenlong Qu","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Wenlong","lastName":"Qu","id":"37285753900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5618441","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Switches","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Delay","Estimation","Switching loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","electric current control","fault tolerance","induction motor drives","machine control","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single current sensor operation","fixed sampling points","TSPWM","fault-tolerance","three-phase inverter-driven systems","SCSO method","tristate pulse-width modulation technique","symmetrical sampling","common-mode voltage","switching loss","DC current ripple reduction","nonideal factor effect analysis","close-loop systems","induction motor drive","power 4 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["single current sensor operation","current reconstruction","common-mode voltage reduction","fault-tolerance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618441","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618441.pdf","startPage":"4413","endPage":"4420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single current sensor operation with fixed sampling points based on TSPWM","abstract":"The single current sensor operation (SCSO) is favorable for cost reduction and fault-tolerance purposes in three-phase inverter-driven systems. This paper addresses a SCSO method based on tri-state pulse-width modulation technique (TSPWM). It enables fixed sampling points with minimal hardware and software requirements. Simultaneous three phase currents can be easily computed due to symmetrical sampling. No change to TSPWM is needed for most working points, thus it maintains advantages in common-mode voltage (CMV), switching loss and DC current ripple reduction. Based on the detailed analysis of non-ideal factor effects, regional modifications enlarge the feasible voltage region to almost the whole hexagon. It works well in close-loop systems and enables seamless transition in fault-tolerance operation for current sensor. Experimental results on a 4-kW induction motor drive are presented to verify the above-mentioned conclusions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5618441/","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628902","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Single current sensor operation with fixed sampling points based on TSPWM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single current sensor operation with fixed sampling points based on TSPWM","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"6410384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056809S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5618451,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Sepahvand","affiliation":["Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Sepahvand","id":"38482011900"},{"name":"Mostafa Khazraei","affiliation":["Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Khazraei","id":"37392169900"},{"name":"Mehdi Ferdowsi","affiliation":["Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Ferdowsi","id":"37271584800"},{"name":"Keith Corzine","affiliation":["Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Corzine","id":"37266743100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5618451","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":706},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618451","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Converters","Inverters","Switches","Pulse width modulation","Topology","Bridge circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridge circuits","diodes","harmonics","PWM invertors","PWM power convertors","PWM rectifiers","switching convertors","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid multilevel inverter","PWM switching","multilevel converter control","three-phase three-level diode-clamped converter","H-bridge cell","staircase switching method","pulse-width modulation method","output waveform","harmonics","fifteen-level converter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fundamental switching","H-bridge cell","Inverter","Multilevel inverter","Pulse width modulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618451","startPage":"4364","endPage":"4367","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618451.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid multilevel inverter with both staircase and PWM switching schemes","abstract":"In this paper, a new method to control multilevel converters is proposed. The considered multilevel converter consists of a three-phase three-level diode-clamped converter (main converter). Two H-bridge cells are then connected in series with each output phase of the main converter. The operation of the main converter and one of the cascading Hbridge cells is based on the staircase switching method. The firing angles of these converters are selected in a way that the dc voltage required for the last H-bridge cell is minimized. The switching pattern of the second H-bridge cell is based on the pulse-width modulation method. This last cell generates the remaining parts of the desired sinusoidal output voltage. The combination of these converters and their switching methods result in an output waveform with low harmonics. Here, a fifteen-level converter is designed based on this approach.

As switching frequency increases, core loss is comparable to or even higher than winding loss. Accurate measurement of core loss is important for magnetic design and converter loss estimation. And exploring new high frequency magnetic materials need a reliable method to evaluate their losses. However, conventional method is limited to low frequency due to sensitivity to phase discrepancy. In this paper, a new method is proposed for high frequency (lMHz~50MHz) core loss measurement. The new method reduces the phase induced error from over 100% to <;5%. So with the proposed methods, the core loss can be accurately measured.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618454","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618454.pdf","startPage":"4384","endPage":"4389","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New core loss measurement method for high frequency magnetic materials","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"New core loss measurement method for high frequency magnetic materials","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5618454/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628788","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618454/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New core loss measurement method for high frequency magnetic materials","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"6370914.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043629S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5618460,"authors":[{"name":"Masahiko Tsukakoshi","affiliation":["Toshiba Mitsubishi Electric Industrial Systems Corporation, Fuchu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Tsukakoshi","id":"37350540000"},{"name":"Mostafa Al Mamun","affiliation":["Toshiba Mitsubishi Electric Industrial Systems Corporation, Fuchu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Mostafa","lastName":"Al Mamun","id":"37601269200"},{"name":"Kazunori Hashimura","affiliation":["Toshiba Mitsubishi Electric Industrial Systems Corporation, Fuchu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Hashimura","id":"37543099100"},{"name":"Hiromi Hosoda","affiliation":["Toshiba Mitsubishi Electric Industrial Systems Corporation, Fuchu, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromi","lastName":"Hosoda","id":"37408718100"},{"name":"Steven C.

In this study, we will introduce our development of a 5-level IEGT (Injection Enhanced Gate Transistor) inverter which is applicable in the Oil and Gas Industry as a high speed, large capacity power train with high efficiency, high reliability, and smooth output voltage waveform. One unit of this inverter has a capacity of 20MVA, so by connecting four units in parallel it is possible to obtain 80MVA rating.

These prove to be more robust against the issue of false alarms, carrying also information about multiple open-circuit failures.

The reason to this is that low-distortion output quantities can be achieved with low average switching frequencies per switch and without output filters. With the M2C the output voltage has such a low harmonic content that high-power motors can be operated without any derating. However, the apparent large number of devices, requires more complex converter control techniques than a two-level counterpart. Even though there have been several ways suggested to control the converter itself, it is still a challenge to investigate the interaction of these controllers with an external motor current controller. It is shown in the paper that the anticipated interaction will not result in any problems neither for the converter nor for the motor control itself.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618474.pdf","startPage":"4293","endPage":"4298","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618474","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On interaction between internal converter dynamics and current control of high-performance high-power AC motor drives with modular multilevel converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Converters","Capacitors","Induction motors","Torque","Voltage control","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC motor drives","electric current control","machine control","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internal converter dynamics","high-performance high-power AC motor drives","modular multilevel converters","external motor current controller"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"On interaction between internal converter dynamics and current control of high-performance high-power AC motor drives with modular multilevel converters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618474/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628803","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On interaction between internal converter dynamics and current control of high-performance high-power AC motor drives with modular multilevel converters","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"6230918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03551S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5618476,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Geyer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Geyer","id":"37391100100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5286-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5287-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5618476","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":640},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Inverters","Stators","Torque","Predictive models","Current control","Harmonic distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","harmonic distortion","invertors","predictive control","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model predictive direct current control","multilevel converters","electrical machines","stator","inverter neutral point potential","admissible switching sequences","short term switching losses","extrapolation","short switching horizon","pulse width modulation","long prediction horizons","harmonic distortion","steady state performance","dynamic response time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Model predictive control","current control","medium-voltage drive"]}],"abstract":"A model predictive current controller for multi-level inverter driving electrical machines is proposed that keeps the stator currents within given bounds around their respective references and balances the inverter's neutral point potential around zero. The inverter switch positions are directly set by the controller thus avoiding the use of a modulator. Admissible switching sequences are enumerated and a state-space model of the drive is used to predict the drive's response to each sequence. The predicted short-term switching losses are evaluated and minimized. The concept of extrapolation and the use of bounds achieve an effective prediction horizon of up to 100 time-steps despite the short switching horizon. When compared to classic modulation schemes such as pulse width modulation, for long prediction horizons, the switching losses and/or the harmonic distortion of the current are almost halved when operating at low pulse numbers, thus effectively resembling the steady-state performance of optimized pulse patterns. During transients the dynamic response time of the proposed controller is in the range of a few ms and thus very fast.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618476","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606065/5617696/05618476.pdf","startPage":"4305","endPage":"4312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2010.5618476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5617696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Direct Current Control for multi-level converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618476/","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Direct Current Control for multi-level converters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11628805","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618476/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Direct Current Control for multi-level converters","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"6250974.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091838S","chronDate":"12-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606065","isNumber":"5617696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606065","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5617696","articleId":"5618476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5618527,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Chen","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37404316400"},{"name":"Hui Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279498800"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications of Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wenbo","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280459100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5618527","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":995},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"In this letter, a novel decode-and-forward (DF) strategy for the two-way relay over Rayleigh fading channels is presented and analyzed.

In addition, it is possible to design optimal constellation labeling maps at the relay node, so that the minimum Euclidean distance among the desired points can be maximized for side-information based demodulation at the destinations. Simulation results indicate that the DF-JM approach performs better than existing DF schemes and the denoise-and-forward (DNF) scheme in terms of the end-to-end bit error rate (BER).","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234/5654470/05618527.pdf","startPage":"1149","endPage":"1151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2010.102610.101566","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2010.102610.101566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5654470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Decoding-and-Forward Scheme with Joint Modulation for Two-Way Relay Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Bit error rate","Fading","Mathematical model","Binary phase shift keying","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","decoding","error statistics","modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding-and-forward scheme","two-way relay channel","DF strategy","Rayleigh fading channels","message encoding","DF-JM scheme","optimal constellation labeling maps","relay node","minimum Euclidean distance","side-information-based demodulation","denoise-and-forward scheme","DNF scheme","end-to-end bit error rate","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-way relay channel","decoding-and-forward","optimal constellation labeling","denoise-and-forward"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Decoding-and-Forward Scheme with Joint Modulation for Two-Way Relay Channel","volume":"14","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5618527/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2010","accessionNumber":"11674872","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Decoding-and-Forward Scheme with Joint Modulation for Two-Way Relay Channel","sourcePdf":"1149-cl1012-chen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06578S","chronDate":"December  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"5654470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5654470","articleId":"5618527","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5618528,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279338600"},{"name":"Lingyun Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lingyun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37598371000"},{"name":"Lei Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37598371100"},{"name":"Dazhuan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Dazhuan","lastName":"Xu","id":"37278440000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"5618528","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":323,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5761},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618528","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Direction of arrival estimation","MIMO radar","US Department of Defense","Arrays","Multiple signal classification","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO radar","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-departure estimation","direction-of-arrival estimation","DOD estimation","DOA estimation","MIMO radar","reduced-dimension MUSIC algorithm","multiple-input multiple-output radar","multiple signal classification algorithm","two-dimension MUSIC algorithm","2D-MUSIC algorithm","ESPRIT algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radar","angle estimation","multi-input multi-output (MIMO)","MUSIC"]}],"abstract":"This letter discusses the problem of direction of departure (DOD) and direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar, and derives a reduced-dimension multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm therein.

These limitations prevent the application of modern signal processing techniques to pre-process the collected sensor data for energy and bandwidth efficient transmission over sensor networks. This tutorial introduces communication and networking generalists without a background in wavelet signal processing to low-memory wavelet transform techniques. We first explain the one-dimensional wavelet transform (including the lifting scheme for in-place computation), the two-dimensional wavelet transform, as well as the evaluation of wavelet transforms with fixed-point arithmetic. Then, we explain the fractional wavelet filter technique which computes wavelet transforms with 16 bit integers and requires less than 1.5 kByte of RAM for a 256 \u00d7 256 gray scale image. We present case studies illustrating the use of these low-memory wavelet techniques in conjunction with image coding systems to achieve image compression competitive to the JPEG2000 standard on resource-constrained wireless sensor nodes. We make the C-code software for the techniques introduced in this tutorial freely available.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/5764312/05618529.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"307","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2011.100110.00059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2011.100110.00059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5764312","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Memory Wavelet Transforms for Wireless Sensor Networks: A Tutorial","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Random access memory","Tutorials","Approximation methods","Image coding","Microcontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","filtering theory","image coding","image sensors","random-access storage","wavelet transforms","wireless sensor networks","Tutorials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-memory wavelet transforms","wireless sensor network","low-energy microcontrollers","random access memory","RAM","sensor data","wavelet signal processing","one-dimensional wavelet transform","two-dimensional wavelet transform","fixed-point arithmetic","fractional wavelet filter technique","gray scale image","image coding systems","image compression","JPEG2000 standard","C-code software","word length 16 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image sensor","sensor network","wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Second Quarter  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Low-Memory Wavelet Transforms for Wireless Sensor Networks: A Tutorial","volume":"13","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5618529/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Second Quarter 2011","accessionNumber":"11974189","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Memory Wavelet Transforms for Wireless Sensor Networks: A Tutorial","sourcePdf":"10reisslein.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148443S","chronDate":"Second Quarter  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"5764312","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5764312","articleId":"5618529","onlineDate":"01 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5618531,"authors":[{"name":"SeungHwan Won","affiliation":["School of ECS, University of Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6151681/5618531/5618531-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["SeungHwan Won (M'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Radio Science and Engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea, in 1999 and 2001, respectively.

Renewable energy resources must take a bigger share in the generation mix, effective demand response must be widely implemented, and high-capacity energy storage systems must be developed. A smart grid is necessary to manage and control the increasingly complex future grid. Certain smart grid elements-renewables, storage, microgrid, consumer choice, and smart appliances-increase uncertainty in both supply and demand of electric power. Other smart gird elements-sensors, smart meters, demand response, and communications-provide more accurate information about the power system and more refined means of control. Simply building hardware for renewable generators and the smart grid, but still using the same operating paradigm of the grid, will not realize the full potential for overall system efficiency and carbon reduction. In this paper, a new operating paradigm, called risk-limiting dispatch, is proposed. It treats generation as a heterogeneous commodity of intermittent or stochastic power and uses information and control to design hedging techniques to manage the risk of uncertainty.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2010.2080250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2010.2080250","startPage":"40","endPage":"57","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5669979/05618534.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5669979","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Operation of Smart Grid: Risk-Limiting Dispatch","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Smart Operation of Smart Grid: Risk-Limiting Dispatch","volume":"99","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","accessionNumber":"11698371","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5618534/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Operation of Smart Grid: Risk-Limiting Dispatch","sourcePdf":"jproc-wu-2080250-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096851S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5669979","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"342","xplore-issue":"5669979","articleId":"5618534","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5618535,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Nanobonding technologies are particularly attractive because they offer void-free, strong, and nanoscale bonding at room temperature or at low temperature (<;200\u00b0C), and without the need for chemicals, adhesives, and high external pressure. Therefore, there are significant potential and opportunities for nanobonding technologies in the development of low cost, low loss, and high-speed miniaturized emerging systems based on a combination of electronic, fluidic, and photonic devices.","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2010.2080261","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/5784182/05618535.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5784182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2010.2080261","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","startPage":"689","endPage":"703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nanobonding Technology Toward Electronic, Fluidic, and Photonic Systems Integration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Nanobonding Technology Toward Electronic, Fluidic, and Photonic Systems Integration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618535/","volume":"17","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5618535/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 2011","accessionNumber":"12036152","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nanobonding Technology Toward Electronic, Fluidic, and Photonic Systems Integration","sourcePdf":"jstqe-howlader-2080261-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128961S","chronDate":"May-June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"5784182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5784182","articleId":"5618535","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5618536,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00e9line Miry","affiliation":["France INSA, IETR, UMR 6164, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"C\u00e9line","lastName":"Miry","id":"37320035600"},{"name":"Thierry Alves","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Paris Est Marne la Vallee, Marne-la-Vallee, France"],"firstName":"Thierry","lastName":"Alves","id":"37318868400"},{"name":"Rapha\u00ebl Gillard","affiliation":["France INSA, IETR, UMR 6164, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Rapha\u00ebl","lastName":"Gillard","id":"37295953600"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Laheurte","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Paris Est Marne la Vallee, Marne-la-Vallee, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marc","lastName":"Laheurte","id":"37297015600"},{"name":"Renaud Loison","affiliation":["France INSA, IETR, UMR 6164, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Renaud","lastName":"Loison","id":"37296222700"},{"name":"Benoit Poussot","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Paris Est Marne la Vallee, Marne-la-Vallee, France"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Poussot","id":"37318866800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"5618536","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter deals with a new technique to efficiently analyze on-body radio channel problems.

The capacity, if-factor, and spatial correlation are evaluated for 226 possible pairs of users whose channels were measured while standing and walking. The proportions of pairings that result in a capacity increase and if-factor and correlation reductions over both, only one and neither of the constituents are determined. It is found that correlation reduction appears to be a stronger sign of capacity improvement than is if-factor reduction. When choosing a partner for a given single user, results show that it is easier to improve these three parameters as the user's value of them becomes poorer, so thresholds applicable to this data set are found which specify values of capacity, if, and correlation beyond which at least 50% of possible pairings improve matters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation Characteristics, Metrics, and Statistics for Virtual MIMO Performance in a Measured Outdoor Cell","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2010.2090643","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5679835/05618548.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2010.2090643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5679835","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618548/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Propagation Characteristics, Metrics, and Statistics for Virtual MIMO Performance in a Measured Outdoor Cell","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5618548/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11729226","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation Characteristics, Metrics, and Statistics for Virtual MIMO Performance in a Measured Outdoor Cell","sourcePdf":"tap-webb-2090643-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097964S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5679835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5679835","articleId":"5618548","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5618549,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Griffin","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science Foundation of Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH-ICS) and Department of Computer Science, University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Griffin","id":"37596011900"},{"name":"Toni Hirvonen","affiliation":["Dolby Laboratories, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Toni","lastName":"Hirvonen","id":"37283132800"},{"name":"Christos Tzagkarakis","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science Foundation of Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH-ICS) and Department of Computer Science, University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Tzagkarakis","id":"37601290700"},{"name":"Athanasios Mouchtaris","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science Foundation of Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH-ICS) and Department of Computer Science, University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Mouchtaris","id":"37284390800"},{"name":"Panagiotis Tsakalides","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science Foundation of Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH-ICS) and Department of Computer Science, University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete, Greece"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Tsakalides","id":"37298333300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1558-7916"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-7924"}],"articleNumber":"5618549","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1064},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Psychoacoustic models","Compressed sensing","Quantization","Frequency estimation","Frequency domain analysis","Audio coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio coding","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-channel sinusoidal audio coding","multichannel sinusoidal audio coding","compressed sensing","frequency domain","audio signal encoding","time-domain description","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Audio coding","compressed sensing (CS)","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","sinusoidal model"]}],"abstract":"Compressed sensing (CS) samples signals at a much lower rate than the Nyquist rate if they are sparse in some basis. In this paper, the CS methodology is applied to sinusoidally modeled audio signals. As this model is sparse by definition in the frequency domain (being equal to the sum of a small number of sinusoids), we investigate whether CS can be used to encode audio signals at low bitrates. In contrast to encoding the sinusoidal parameters (amplitude, frequency, phase) as current state-of-the-art methods do, we propose encoding few randomly selected samples of the time-domain description of the sinusoidal component (per signal segment). The potential of applying compressed sensing both to single-channel and multi-channel audio coding is examined. The listening test results are encouraging, indicating that the proposed approach can achieve comparable performance to that of state-of-the-art methods. Given that CS can lead to novel coding systems where the sampling and compression operations are combined into one low-complexity step, the proposed methodology can be considered as an important step towards applying the CS framework to audio coding applications.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2010.2090656","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5762410/05618549.pdf","startPage":"1382","endPage":"1395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2090656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5762410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Channel and Multi-Channel Sinusoidal Audio Coding Using Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618549/","displayDocTitle":"Single-Channel and Multi-Channel Sinusoidal Audio Coding Using Compressed Sensing","volume":"19","issue":"5","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"11987230","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Channel and Multi-Channel Sinusoidal Audio Coding Using Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tasl-griffin-2090656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051476S","chronDate":"July  2011","isNumber":"5762410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"24","articleId":"5618549","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5618550,"authors":[{"name":"Jibran Yousafzai","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5762410/5618550/5618550-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jibran Yousafzai (S'08) received the B.S. degree in computer system engineering from the GIK Institute, Topi, Pakistan, in 2004 and the M.Sc. degree in signal processing from King's College London, London, U.K., in 2006.

The measurement of respiratory amplitude, in addition to the breathing rate, is crucial for sleep apnea assessment which requires, among other things, the accurate estimation of tidal volume per minute. Backscattered UWB impulse radio signals from a human subject are detected in the time domain to calculate the chest displacements in this paper. Since the pulse disposition in time is linearly related to the chest movement, the amplitude of the chest movement can be extracted accurately without calculation approximations normally used in many of the existing methods. The multipeak detection of the pulse disposition method, instead of using only the single pulse peak detection, is also proposed to improve the accuracy of the calculation further. The experiments are carried out on four human subjects with different sizes and genders. The correlation of the chest movements' amplitude and breathing rate between the simultaneously measured results obtained by our method and by the respiratory chest band is very good.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/5710177/05618561.pdf","startPage":"928","endPage":"938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2010.2064370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2010.2064370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710177","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Sensing of Human Respiratory Parameters by Low-Power Ultrawideband Impulse Radio Radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Phantoms","Oscilloscopes","Frequency measurement","Time measurement","Radar","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backscatter","medical signal detection","patient monitoring","respiratory protection","sleep","ultra wideband communication","ultra wideband radar","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human respiratory parameters","ultrawideband radar","impulse radio","wireless sensing","chest respiratory rate","sleep apnea monitoring","backscattering","pulse disposition method","multipeak detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Impulse radio radar","respiratory parameters","sleep apnea","ultrawideband (UWB)","wireless sensor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Sensing of Human Respiratory Parameters by Low-Power Ultrawideband Impulse Radio Radar","volume":"60","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5618561/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11793792","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Sensing of Human Respiratory Parameters by Low-Power Ultrawideband Impulse Radio Radar","sourcePdf":"tim-gunawan-2064370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061082S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"5710177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5710177","articleId":"5618561","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5618568,"authors":[{"name":"Haihong Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5680555/5618568/5618568-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haihong Zhang (M'07) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2005.","He joined the Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, and later became a Principal Investigator for multimodal neural decoding.

We consider the primary neurophysiologic phenomenon of motor imagery, termed event-related desynchronization, and formulate the learning task for feature extraction as maximizing the mutual information between the spatio-spectral filtering parameters and the class labels. After introducing a nonparametric estimate of mutual information, a gradient-based learning algorithm is devised to efficiently optimize the spatial filters in conjunction with a band-pass filter. The proposed method is compared with two existing methods on real data: a BCI Competition IV dataset as well as our data collected from seven human subjects. The results indicate the superior performance of the method for motor imagery classification, as it produced higher classification accuracy with statistical significance (\u226595% confidence level) in most cases.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Electroencephalography","Feature extraction","Entropy","Optimization","Band pass filters","Rhythm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","electroencephalography","feature extraction","filtering theory","gradient methods","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum spatio spectral filtering network","brain computer interface","feature extraction method","BCI","electroencephalogram","motor imagery","mutual information","gradient based learning algorithm","bandpass filter","spatial filters","motor imagery classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brain\u2013computer interface","motor imagery electroencephalography","spatio-spectral filtering"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Brain","Electroencephalography","Evoked Potentials, Motor","Humans","Male","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated","User-Computer Interface"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TNN.2010.2084099","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5680555/05618568.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5680555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2010.2084099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Spatio-Spectral Filtering Network for Brain\u2013Computer Interface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Spatio-Spectral Filtering Network for Brain\u2013Computer Interface","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618568/","volume":"22","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618568/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11742248","pubMedId":"21216696","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Spatio-Spectral Filtering Network for Brain\u2013Computer Interface","sourcePdf":"tnn-zhang-2084099-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116963S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5680555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5680555","articleId":"5618568","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5618569,"authors":[{"name":"Ruxi Wang","affiliation":["Center for Power Electronics Systems, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/5899001/5618569/5618569-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ruxi Wang (S\u201910) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.

The low-frequency harmonic current is normally filtered using a bulk capacitor in the bus, which results in low power density. However, pursuing high power density in converter design is a very important goal in the aerospace applications. This paper studies methods for reducing the energy storage capacitor for single-phase rectifiers. The minimum ripple energy storage requirement is derived independently of a specific topology. Based on the minimum ripple energy requirement, the feasibility of the active capacitor's reduction schemes is verified. Then, we propose a bidirectional buck-boost converter as the ripple energy storage circuit, which can effectively reduce the energy storage capacitance. The analysis and design are validated by simulation and experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2010.2090670","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/5899001/05618569.pdf","startPage":"1430","endPage":"1443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5899001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2010.2090670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High Power Density Single-Phase PWM Rectifier With Active Ripple Energy Storage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","displayDocTitle":"A High Power Density Single-Phase PWM Rectifier With Active Ripple Energy Storage","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618569/","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12068855","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618569/","volume":"26","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High Power Density Single-Phase PWM Rectifier With Active Ripple Energy Storage","sourcePdf":"tpel-wang-2090670-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175843S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"5899001","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"372","xplore-issue":"5899001","articleId":"5618569","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":5618578,"authors":[{"name":"Chunbo Luo","affiliation":["School of Systems Engineering, University of Reading, Reading, UK"],"firstName":"Chunbo","lastName":"Luo","id":"37598691600"},{"name":"Yu Gong","affiliation":["School of Systems Engineering, University of Reading, Reading, UK"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Gong","id":"37271887300"},{"name":"Fuchun Zheng","affiliation":["School of Systems Engineering, University of Reading, Reading, UK"],"firstName":"Fuchun","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38182100600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"5618578","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1342},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper proposes the full interference cancellation (FIC) algorithm to cancel the interrelay interference (IRI) in the two-path cooperative system.

The convergence of 802.16 and PON networks can take the mobility feature of wireless communications and the bandwidth advantage of optical networks jointly. Dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) plays an important role in each of these two networks for QoS assurance. In converged 802.16 and PON networks, the integration of the DBA schemes in both networks plays an even more critical role, since bandwidth request/grant mechanisms used in 802.16 and PON are different and the performance of the integrated DBA directly determines the overall system performance. In this paper, we investigate integrated dynamic bandwidth allocation schemes and their signaling overhead. First, this paper starts with discussing the converged network architecture and especially the issues on integrating optical network unit (ONU) and 802.16 base station (BS). Second, it proposes a slotted DBA (S-DBA) scheme and its performance analytic model. The S-DBA scheme takes into account the specific features of the converged network, aiming to reduce signaling overhead caused by cascaded bandwidth requests and grants. The simulation results show that the proposed S-DBA scheme can effectively reduce signaling overhead and increase channel utilization.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/4267003/5635427/05618584.pdf","startPage":"467","endPage":"476","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2010.2088750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2010.2088750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5635427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in Converged Passive Optical Networks and IEEE 802.16 Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618584/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in Converged Passive Optical Networks and IEEE 802.16 Networks","htmlLink":"/document/5618584/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2010","accessionNumber":"11661376","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation in Converged Passive Optical Networks and IEEE 802.16 Networks","sourcePdf":"jsyst-chen-2088750-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053396S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"5635427","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5635427","articleId":"5618584","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5618593,"authors":[{"name":"Jau-Horng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science and Ocean Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5702426/5618593/5618593-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jau-Horng Chen (M'09) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","From 2006 to 2008, he was a Design Engineer with Freescale Semiconductor, Tempe, AZ, where he was involved in designing dc\u2013dc converters and predistortion linearizers for cell phone power amplifiers (PAs).

Using the transmitter, single-phase, two-phase, and four-phase pulsewidth modulated signals were tested to verify the benefits of using the proposed multiphase architecture.

The detector module comprises a 25.5 mm \u00d7 25.5 mm \u00d7 10 mm LYSO crystal coupled to a Hamamatsu 64 channels multi-anode PMT H7546B. The electronics for the detector module reads out all the signal channels, which represents the distribution of the scintillating light for each 7 event, and calculates the impinging position according to the pre-defined neural network algorithms if the event satisfies the energy and timing selection conditions. Compared with classical pixelated detectors, a monolithic scintillator based detector module features a simpler design, lower cost, and better energy resolution, but has lower signal to noise ratio and a more complicated signal readout scheme and data processing. By Monte-Carlo simulation, the performances of several readout schemes were compared. An optimized readout scheme which combines the 64 channels into 16 digitized signals was adopted in our electronics design. After the high resolution signal waveform digitization, an FPGA takes charge of the remaining digital signal processing, including the on-line hardware execution of the neural network positioning algorithms. We have implemented the electronics system for the detector modules. A pipelined implementation of the optimized neural network algorithms in the FPGA is able to process up to 15.3 M events per second without loss of performance compared to an off-line implementation. In addition to the function validation tests, the preliminary performance of the detector module we are building for a PET system is also reported.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/5710485/05618604.pdf","startPage":"34","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2010.2081685","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2010.2081685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Based Electronics for PET Detector Modules With Neural Network Position Estimators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Based Electronics for PET Detector Modules With Neural Network Position Estimators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618604/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618604/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11793821","volume":"58","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Based Electronics for PET Detector Modules With Neural Network Position Estimators","sourcePdf":"tns-wang-2081685-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103158S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"5710485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5710485","articleId":"5618604","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5618888,"authors":[{"name":"Praveen Kaligineedi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5686852/5618888/5618888-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Praveen Kaligineedi Praveen Kaligineedi received his Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, India, in May 2004 and M.A.Sc degree from University of British Columbia (UBC), Canada in November 2006.

The proposed distributed code can be viewed as a serially concatenated code (SCC). Thus, at the destination decoding is performed in an iterative fashion which resembles the decoding of a classic SCC. We consider the two scenarios where the sources transmit over orthogonal channels and where they do not. For the latter, interleave-division multiple-access is used for multiuser detection. For both scenarios we optimize the transmission time allocated to the sources and to the relay and compute the achievable rates. The proposed scheme achieves very low error rates and offers significant performance gains with respect to non-cooperation, even for a very large number of sources. Furthermore, it provides a high flexibility in terms of code rate, number of sources, overall system rate and error protection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","volume":"10","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11742928","publicationDate":"January 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618891/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Serially Concatenated Codes for Multi-Source Cooperative Relay Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Serially Concatenated Codes for Multi-Source Cooperative Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"253-tw1101-youssef.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087966S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5686852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5686852","articleId":"5618891","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5618892,"authors":[{"name":"Hyukjoon Kwon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5686852/5618892/5618892-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyukjoon Kwon [S'06] received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Korea, in 2001.

Instead of continually varying the power allocation for multiple beams based on instantaneous channel state information (CSI) feedback, the proposed scheme determines power allocation in advance solely based on channel statistics and the number of mobile stations (MSs). This scheme maintains power allocation throughout multiple training and data transmission periods as long as channel statistics and the number of MSs are unchanged. As a result, the proposed scheme reduces the complexity for searching power allocation, and becomes robust over finite feedback channels. Computer simulations show that the proposed power allocation search algorithms efficiently find the near optimal power allocation with low complexity. The simulations also show that, although the proposed scheme predetermines power allocation solely based on channel statistics and the number of MSs, it outperforms the opportunistic beamforming scheme using instantaneous CSI feedback with finite feedback rates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618892/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","volume":"10","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11742902","publicationDate":"January 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618892/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Predetermined Power Allocation for Opportunistic Beamforming with Limited Feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predetermined Power Allocation for Opportunistic Beamforming with Limited Feedback","sourcePdf":"084-tw1101-kwon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080127S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5686852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5686852","articleId":"5618892","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5618893,"authors":[{"name":"Foroogh S.

The SNR expression is derived and three different analytical approaches with different simplifying assumptions are proposed to obtain the probability distribution function of the SNR and the outage probability in each mode. All but one approach result in closed-form expressions for the outage probability. The simplest approach in each mode has been used to find an optimum power allocation scheme for pilot and data symbols transmission at the source and the relay that results in minimizing the outage probability. Numerical analysis is used to confirm the accuracy of the derived theory and to show that the analytical approaches have a good outage performance, especially as the relay-destination distance increases. It is shown that significant power savings (e.g. 6 dB in VG mode) can be obtained by using the proposed power optimization method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.102810.091729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5686852","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5686852/05618893.pdf","endPage":"134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Probability and Power Allocation of Amplify and Forward Relaying with Channel Estimation Errors","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.102810.091729","startPage":"124","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","displayDocTitle":"Outage Probability and Power Allocation of Amplify and Forward Relaying with Channel Estimation Errors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618893/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742919","publicationDate":"January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5618893/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Probability and Power Allocation of Amplify and Forward Relaying with Channel Estimation Errors","sourcePdf":"124-tw1101-tabataba.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073783S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5686852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5686852","articleId":"5618893","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5618894,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE), Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5686852/5618894/5618894-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Yu received the B.Eng.

A comparison among various adaptive and non-adaptive MIMO systems reveals the proposed system as a good trade-off between the spectral efficiency, BER and system complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Coded MIMO Systems with Near Full Multiplexing Gain Using Outdated CSI","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2010.102810.100602","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5686852/05618895.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2010.102810.100602","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5686852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 November 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Coded MIMO Systems with Near Full Multiplexing Gain Using Outdated CSI","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5618895/","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2011","publicationDate":"January 2011","accessionNumber":"11742929","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Coded MIMO Systems with Near Full Multiplexing Gain Using Outdated CSI","sourcePdf":"294-tw1101-zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067621S","chronDate":"January  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5686852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5686852","articleId":"5618895","onlineDate":"09 November 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5618945,"authors":[{"name":"Dongbo Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Dongbo Zhao","id":"37595532600"},{"name":"Chanan Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Chanan","lastName":"Singh","id":"37271764800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8047-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8046-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8045-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5618945","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium","Generators","Reliability","Monte Carlo methods","Power system reliability","Biological cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Monte Carlo methods","power system reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","power system reliability evaluation","parameter determination","power systems","reliability indices calculation","state space pruning tool","Monte Carlo simulation","IEEE reliability test system","RTS 79","MRTS","GA-MCS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic Algorithm","reliability evaluation","state space pruning","computational efficiency","Monte Carlo simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618945","abstract":"Genetic Algorithm (GA) is emerging as a popular tool in the optimization problems of power systems. In reliability indices calculation and adequacy assessment, methods have been previously developed to use GA as the sampling tool. One of the techniques developed is to use GA as the state space pruning tool in order to truncate the state space before calculating the reliability indices. This means to generate a pruned state space, in which the density of failure states is much higher than the original state space, and then Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) is used as the final tool to assess the state space and have the reliability indices calculated. GA is used as the state space pruning tool to remove as many success states as possible, with overall computational efficiency in the residual space better than only using Monte Carlo simulation over the entire. The GA has selection, crossover, and mutation operations, with associated parameters controlling every step. The decision of the parameters and the stopping criterion does not have obvious rules. This paper presents a modified GA as the state space pruning tool, with higher efficiency and controllable stopping criterion as well as parameter selection. The modified GA has better efficiency than previous methods, and it is easier to have its parameters selected. This method is tested using the IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS 79 and MRTS), and is compared with original GA-MCS method.","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2010.5618945","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"North American Power Symposium 2010","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2010.5618945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5618939","displayPublicationTitle":"North American Power Symposium 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606057/5618939/05618945.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Genetic Algorithm in state space pruning for power system reliability evaluation and its parameter determination","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618945/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modified Genetic Algorithm in state space pruning for power system reliability evaluation and its parameter determination","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618945/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11630532","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Genetic Algorithm in state space pruning for power system reliability evaluation and its parameter determination","confLoc":"Arlington, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"paperid1113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048203S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606057","isNumber":"5618939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606057","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5618939","articleId":"5618945","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5618960,"authors":[{"name":"Shahab Shariat Torghaban","affiliation":["Department of Energy and Environment at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Shahab Shariat","lastName":"Torghaban","id":"37601330500"},{"name":"Hamidreza Zareipour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada"],"firstName":"Hamidreza","lastName":"Zareipour","id":"37399771900"},{"name":"Le Anh Tuan","affiliation":["Department of Energy and Environment at Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Le Anh","lastName":"Tuan","id":"38529439700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8047-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8046-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-8045-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5618960","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":341},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618960","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Forecasting","Data models","Electricity","Biological system modeling","Meteorology","Contracts"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economic forecasting","hydroelectric power stations","power generation economics","power markets","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medium-term electricity market price forecasting","data-driven approach","regression-based linear forecasting model","electricity spot price","electricity supply industry deregulation","Nord Pool market","12-month-ahead forecast"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electricity price forecasting","medium-term","regression","hydro reservoir"]}],"abstract":"Medium-term electricity price forecasting is necessary for several applications in electricity markets, such as pricing derivatives, maintenance scheduling for generation companies, and budgeting and fuel contracting.

Since the static security analysis is highly dependent on the topology of external system, it is critical for the internal system operator to be aware of any external topology changes. Currently, information about the breaker status in the external system is not commonly telemetered to the internal system. Therefore, external line outage detection remains a potential problem to a large number of utility companies. This paper proposes a new method to identify an external network line outage based on the internal system measurements.","displayPublicationTitle":"North American Power Symposium 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606057/5618939/05618980.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"North American Power Symposium 2010","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2010.5618980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2010.5618980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5618939","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5618980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking changes in the external network model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programming","Lightning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit breakers","power system faults","power system interconnection","power system measurement","power system security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interconnected system","external network model","real-time external line status information","internal power system dispatcher","static security analysis","circuit breaker status","external line outage detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["External network equivalent","contingency analysis","line outage","topology errors","mixed-integer programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5618980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Tracking changes in the external network model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5618980/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630501","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking changes in the external network model","confLoc":"Arlington, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"paperid1067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05063S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606057","isNumber":"5618939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606057","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5618939","articleId":"5618980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5619005,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Xiaozhi","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Liu Xiaozhi","id":"37596060900"},{"name":"Han Ying","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Han Ying","id":"37589950600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7235-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-9069"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-9077"}],"articleNumber":"5619005","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"abstract":"Independent component analysis (ICA) is a signal processing technique that aims to recover a set of unknown mutually independent source signals from their observed mixtures without knowledge of the mixing coefficients.

For traditional ICA algorithms ignore noise, in this paper Noise-ICA algorithm is proposed for multi-user detection of direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) signal and compared with Infomax-ICA algorithm and Fast-ICA algorithm. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of negentropy estimation. In this paper bit error rate simulations of these algorithms has been given for different number of users, SNR and compared.

First, the reference model of flux identification should be established according to induction motor u-n mathematical model under the static coordinate system. Then, a RBF neural network can be constructed on this basis. After self-organization learning, online identification of stator flux can be realized in the RBF neural network.

In view of the communication features of group call service, the limited radio channel resources and the utilization of existing network elements in TD-SCDMA network, TD-SCDMA network structure which supports the group call service is designed. At the same time, the functions of main network elements are described. Then it is a focused discussion that TD-SCDMA system adopts wireless channel allocation mechanism for group call service, especially in traffic channel allocation mechanism. The communication protocols of the group call are given in detail. Finally, the group call communication is simulated by using OPNET software. The performance of group call and the impact on TD-SCDMA network are analyzed. The result shows that the radio resources can be efficiently shared by group call members after adopting the rational network structure and wireless channel allocation mechanism.

Due to the high DC voltages and the aging of the systems, long-lasting arc faults can occur which may cause serious fires. As an initial step to develop sensor-devices for detecting arc faults in photovoltaic systems, a test set-up consisting of several modules, a solar inverter, and a unit for creating artificial arc faults was installed. The analysis of the measured signals in time and frequency domain showed the following: Parallel arcing involves significant changes in the current at the primary side of the converter and is therefore easily detectable. Series arc faults, however, can usually not be detected by a low frequency analysis of current and voltage signals due to the specific characteristic curve of the photovoltaic modules, the control-concept of the converter for maximum power tracking, and possibly changing solar irradiance. Sensors and methods considering the higher spectral components of the arc effects are necessary.","doi":"10.1109/HOLM.2010.5619538","publicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the 56th IEEE Holm Conference on Electrical Contacts","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the 56th IEEE Holm Conference on Electrical Contacts","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618477/5619452/05619538.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOLM.2010.5619538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5619452","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arc Faults in Photovoltaic Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5619538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5619538/","displayDocTitle":"Arc Faults in Photovoltaic Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11639108","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5619538/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arc Faults in Photovoltaic Systems","confLoc":"Charleston, SC, USA","sourcePdf":"01-32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071723S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5618477","isNumber":"5619452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618477","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5619452","articleId":"5619538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5619586,"authors":[{"name":"Saurabh S.

However, the biggest challenge in integrating wind power into the electric grid is its intermittency. One approach to deal with wind intermittency is forecasting future values of wind power production. Thus, several wind power or wind speed forecasting methods have been reported in the literature over the past few years. This paper provides insight on the foremost forecasting techniques, associated with wind power and speed, based on numeric weather prediction (NWP), statistical approaches, artificial neural network (ANN) and hybrid techniques over different time-scales. An overview of comparative analysis of various available forecasting techniques is discussed as well. In addition, this paper further gives emphasis on the major challenges and problems associated with wind power prediction.","doi":"10.1109/NAPS.2010.5619586","publicationTitle":"North American Power Symposium 2010","displayPublicationTitle":"North American Power Symposium 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5606057/5618939/05619586.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAPS.2010.5619586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5618939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A review of wind power and wind speed forecasting methods with different time horizons","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5619586","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Sept. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5619586/","displayDocTitle":"A review of wind power and wind speed forecasting methods with different time horizons","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630567","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5619586/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A review of wind power and wind speed forecasting methods with different time horizons","confLoc":"Arlington, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"paperid1055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119451S","chronDate":"26-28 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5606057","isNumber":"5618939","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5606057","citationCount":"341","xplore-issue":"5618939","articleId":"5619586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":5619596,"authors":[{"name":"V\u00edctor S\u00e1nchez","affiliation":["CINVESTAV, Guadalajara, Mexico","CINVESTAV, Guadalajara"],"bio":{"p":["Victor Sanchez received his BS in Electronics Engineering from Tecnologico de Orizaba, Mexico in 1996; M.Sc. in Electronics Engineering from CENIDET-Mexico in 2000.

The circuits were designed with a grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW) and 0.12-\u03bcm GaN HEMT technology. One OSC, which was based on a simple series source feedback topology, oscillated at a frequency of 74.5 GHz with an output power of 2.2 mW (3.38 dBm). This oscillation frequency was the highest ever reported for GaN HEMT OSCs. Another OSC with a buffer delivered a record power of 85 mW (19.28 dBm) at 70.75 GHz. In addition, a single-chip PA with a 3-stage common source scheme delivered an output power of 1.3 W (31.13 dBm) at 75 GHz with a CW source module. The 3-dB bandwidth of the PA was 13 GHz from 67 to 80 GHz. The performance of these devices is sufficient for use in E-band fixed wireless access systems and automotive radar systems. The results demonstrate that the GaN HEMTs represent a feasible means of addressing the stringent demands imposed by various millimeter-wave applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"E-Band 85-mW Oscillator and 1.3-W Amplifier ICs Using 0.12\u00b5m GaN HEMTs for Millimeter-Wave Transceivers","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","doi":"10.1109/CSICS.2010.5619643","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Compound Semiconductor Integrated Circuit Symposium (CSICS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5618478/5619580/05619643.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSICS.2010.5619643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5619580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5619643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5619643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","displayDocTitle":"E-Band 85-mW Oscillator and 1.3-W Amplifier ICs Using 0.12\u00b5m GaN HEMTs for Millimeter-Wave Transceivers","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5619643/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630811","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"E-Band 85-mW Oscillator and 1.3-W Amplifier ICs Using 0.12\u00b5m GaN HEMTs for Millimeter-Wave Transceivers","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"l04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075204S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5618478","isNumber":"5619580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618478","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"5619580","articleId":"5619643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5619645,"authors":[{"name":"Charles F.

As discussed in, peculiarities of GaN device physics exposed flaws in the standard EEHEMT model such as the inability to describe trap-related phenomena such as knee walk-out, multiple voltage dependencies of conduction currents, anomalies in the saturation current/conductance, and nonlinear behavior of source resistance. Improvements were made to the standard model to accommodate GaN-specific characteristics of the knee and saturation regions of the device IV plane as well as a functional dependence of Rs on RF operating current. Additionally, temperature dependencies were implemented in the Verilog-A version using a thermal sub-circuit to account for self-heating in real-time and ambient temperature effects. Extensive pulsed and CW load-pull measurements were done at multiple source/load states and power levels and at several frequencies. Output power, gain, efficiency and load-pull contour simulations vs. measurements are presented. The improved model is shown to accurately predict actual device and scaled high-power amplifier behavior and has proven to be a useful tool in very high power product design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5619689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5619689/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630783","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Verilog-A Large-Signal GaN HEMT Model for High Power Amplifier Design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Verilog-A Large-Signal GaN HEMT Model for High Power Amplifier Design","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"c04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035193S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5618478","isNumber":"5619580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618478","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5619580","articleId":"5619689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5619691,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Horn","affiliation":["High-Frequency Technology Center, Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Rosa, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Horn","id":"37548943400"},{"name":"David E.

Through heterogeneous integration of advanced InP HBTs with commercially fabricated CMOS circuits, the program has successfully demonstrated world-record differential amplifiers and is currently developing complex wideband, large dynamic range, high-speed digital-to-analog converters (DACs) employing sophisticated in situ digital correction techniques enabled by CMOS integration. This paper will also discuss future directions of technical approaches, for example integration of high power CS devices such as GaN transistors with silicon-based linearization techniques developed under DARPA's Efficient Linearized All-Silicon Transmitter ICs (ELASTx) program to realize next-generation microwave/mm-wave transmitters. In these future transmitters, the high breakdown voltage CS devices will be used to implement efficient, although non-linear, power amplifiers while the required linearity for complex waveforms will be recovered through integrated linearization architectures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5619698/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11630803","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","conferenceDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5619698/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The DARPA COSMOS and ELASTx Programs: Towards Next Generation Linearized Microwave/Mm-Wave Transmitters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The DARPA COSMOS and ELASTx Programs: Towards Next Generation Linearized Microwave/Mm-Wave Transmitters","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"a04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055796S","chronDate":"3-6 Oct. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5618478","isNumber":"5619580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618478","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5619580","articleId":"5619698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5619702,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The introduced Time-Encoding Quantizer (TEQ) is implemented inside a \u03a3\u0394 modulator by replacing a multibit quantizer. An innovative TEQ is used to overcome design issues in a 1.0V supply-voltage 65nm digital CMOS technology. The TEQ allows an exchange of amplitude-resolution by time-resolution. The approach of time-resolution alleviates the scaling difficulties of mixed-signal circuits in nano-scale technologies. The TEOC features a 63dB dynamic-range and a peak-SNDR of 61 dB over a 20MHz signal bandwidth.

The transceiver ensures low EVM over the wide dynamic range due to highly linear RX and TX signal paths, and low integrated PLL phase noise characteristics.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 2\u00d72 MIMO tri-band dual-mode CMOS transceiver for worldwide WiMAX/WLAN applications","publicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of ESSCIRC","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2010.5619741","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of ESSCIRC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609034/5619583/05619741.pdf","startPage":"454","endPage":"457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2010.5619741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5619583","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5619741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5619741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A 2\u00d72 MIMO tri-band dual-mode CMOS transceiver for worldwide WiMAX/WLAN applications","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5619741/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630718","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 2\u00d72 MIMO tri-band dual-mode CMOS transceiver for worldwide WiMAX/WLAN applications","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"C1024360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067984S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609034","isNumber":"5619583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609034","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5619583","articleId":"5619741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5619742,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo Augusto Dal Fabbro","affiliation":["ELap, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Paulo Augusto","lastName":"Dal Fabbro","id":"37642921900"},{"name":"Tindaro Pittorino","affiliation":["EM Microelectronic-Marin S.A., Marin, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Tindaro","lastName":"Pittorino","id":"37603554200"},{"name":"Christoph Kuratli","affiliation":["EM Microelectronic-Marin S.A., Marin, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Kuratli","id":"37352446500"},{"name":"Robert Kvacek","affiliation":["EM Microelectronic-Marin S.A., Marin, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Kvacek","id":"37594600600"},{"name":"Martin Kucera","affiliation":["CSEM, Neuchatel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Kucera","id":"37071787600"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Giroud","affiliation":["CSEM, Neuchatel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","lastName":"Giroud","id":"37402503000"},{"name":"Steve Tanner","affiliation":["ESPLAB, EPF Lausanne, Neuchatel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Tanner","id":"37326070800"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chastellain","affiliation":["ESPLAB, EPF Lausanne, Neuchatel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","lastName":"Chastellain","id":"37594596400"},{"name":"Arnaud Casagrande","affiliation":["Asulab, Marin, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Arnaud","lastName":"Casagrande","id":"37593347600"},{"name":"Arthur Descombes","affiliation":["EM Microelectronic-Marin S.A., Marin, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Arthur","lastName":"Descombes","id":"37400629600"},{"name":"Vincent Peiris","affiliation":["CSEM, Neuchatel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Peiris","id":"37274459200"},{"name":"Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Farine","affiliation":["ESPLAB, EPF Lausanne, Neuchatel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pierre-Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Farine","id":"37396003100"},{"name":"Maher Kayal","affiliation":["ELap, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Maher","lastName":"Kayal","id":"37276152600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6664-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6662-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8833"},{"format":"CD","value":"1930-8833"}],"articleNumber":"5619742","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":636},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5619742","abstract":"A low-energy 2.4GHz RF transceiver supporting 1Mb/s Gaussian Frequency-Shift Keying modulation and designed to run on a 1.5V battery is implemented in a standard 0.18\u00b5m CMOS technology.

The Vt of pass gates (PGs) is gradually lowered during the read process from the initial high value until the stored data is detected by the sense amplifier.

scheme that can be actually adopted in DRAM are presented. A multi-cell structure is newly devised to circumvent the large process variation problems of the DRAM cell capacitor type antifuse system. The programming current is less than 564\u03bcA up to the nine-cell case. The experimental results show that the cumulative distribution of the successful rupture in multi-cell structure is dramatically enhanced to be less than 15% of single-cell's case and the recovery problem of the programmed cell after the thermal stress (300\u00b0C) is disappeared. In addition, also presented is a Post-Package Repair (PPR) scheme that is directly coupled to external power using additional pin for the requisite high voltage with protection circuits, saving the chip area otherwise consumed by the internal pump circuitry. A 1Gbit DDR SDRAM is fabricated using Samsung's advanced 50nm DRAM process technology, successfully showing the feasibility of the proposed antifuse system implemented in it.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5619748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630655","htmlLink":"/document/5619748/","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A highly reliable multi-cell antifuse scheme using DRAM cell capacitors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A highly reliable multi-cell antifuse scheme using DRAM cell capacitors","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"C1094143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04723S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609034","isNumber":"5619583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609034","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5619583","articleId":"5619748","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5619749,"authors":[{"name":"Erik \u00d6jefors","affiliation":["High-Frequency and Communication Technology, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"\u00d6jefors","id":"37283789400"},{"name":"Neda Baktash","affiliation":["High-Frequency and Communication Technology, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Neda","lastName":"Baktash","id":"37594580700"},{"name":"Yan Zhao","affiliation":["High-Frequency and Communication Technology, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37596266100"},{"name":"Richard Al Hadi","affiliation":["High-Frequency and Communication Technology, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Richard Al","lastName":"Hadi","id":"37589074200"},{"name":"Hani Sherry","affiliation":["High-Frequency and Communication Technology, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany","STMicroelectronics, Crolles, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Hani","lastName":"Sherry","id":"37601680600"},{"name":"Ullrich R.

MIMO technology is therefore adopted in many recent communication standards, such as IEEE 802.11n. Here, the MIMO detector has a strong impact on the overall system performance. In fact, the full potential of MIMO communication systems can only be achieved by means of iterative MIMO decoding using soft-input soft-output (SISO) data detection. In this paper, we present-to the best of our knowledge-the first VLSI implementation of a SISO detector for iterative MIMO decoding.

The architecture presented uses stacking to share bias current among the input differential pairs of four amplifiers.

By arranging the stacked differential pairs appropriately, we generate 16 output currents that encode the original inputs in a linearly independent (orthogonal) fashion. These outputs are then recombined in much lower power output stages to reconstruct amplified versions of the inputs. Our design was built in standard 130nm CMOS and has a noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 2.7, close to the lowest published for a differential amplifier.

Currently, the fastest cryptographic primitive approved by the U.S. National Institute for Standard and Technology, that combines data encryption and authentication, is the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) of operation. If the feasibility to increase the speed of the GCM up to 100 Gbit/s on ASIC technologies has already been demonstrated, the FPGA implementation of the GCM in secure 100G Ethernet network systems arises some important structural issues. In this paper, we report on an efficient FPGA architecture of the GCM combined with the AES block cipher. With the parallelization of four pipelined AES-GCM cores we were able to reach the speed required by the new Ethernet standard. Furthermore, the time-critical binary field multiplication of the authentication process relies on four pipelined 2-step Karatsuba-Ofman multipliers.","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2010.5619894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2010.5619894","publicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of ESSCIRC","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of ESSCIRC","pdfPath":"/iel5/5609034/5619583/05619894.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5619583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA parallel-pipelined AES-GCM core for 100G Ethernet applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5619894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"FPGA parallel-pipelined AES-GCM core for 100G Ethernet applications","conferenceDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2010","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630646","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5619894/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA parallel-pipelined AES-GCM core for 100G Ethernet applications","confLoc":"Seville, Spain","sourcePdf":"C0384320.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091767S","chronDate":"14-16 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5609034","isNumber":"5619583","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5609034","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5619583","articleId":"5619894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5619896,"authors":[{"name":"Jinshu Zhao","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Jinshu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37598307500"},{"name":"Marcus Hellfeld","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Marcus","lastName":"Hellfeld","id":"37593210900"},{"name":"Thomas Wolf","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37604560400"},{"name":"Frank Ellinger","affiliation":["Chair for Circuit Design and Network Theory, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Ellinger","id":"37275628500"},{"name":"Le Ye","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Ye","id":"37588276600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6664-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6662-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1930-8833"},{"format":"CD","value":"1930-8833"}],"articleNumber":"5619896","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Clocks","Power harmonic filters","Transmitters","Baseband","Attenuation","Cutoff frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR filters","heterojunction bipolar transistors","monolithic integrated circuits","quadrature phase shift keying","silicon compounds","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite impulse response pulse shaping filter","transmitter","QPSK modulation","FIR pulse shaping filter","quadrature phase-shift keying","stringent spectrum mask requirement","digital-to-analog converters","HBT technology","integrated circuit","bit rate 3.5 Gbit/s","frequency 60 GHz","gain 19 dB","frequency 2.2 GHz","size 0.25 mum","voltage 3.3 V","current 300 mA","SiGe"]}],"abstract":"A 17-tap 3.5 Gbps finite impulse response (FIR) pulse shaping filter for 60 GHz transmitters with quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulation is presented.
