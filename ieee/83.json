In the case of a multimedia call, each of its substreams (i.e. video, audio and data) has its own distinct quality of service (QoS) requirements (e.g. cell loss rate, delay, jitter, etc.). The network attempts to deliver the required QoS by allocating an appropriate amount of resources (e.g., bandwidth, buffers). The negotiated QoS requirements constitute a certain QoS level that remains fixed during the call (static allocation approach). Accordingly, the corresponding allocated resources also remain unchanged. We present and analyze an adaptive allocation of resources algorithm based on genetic algorithms. In contrast to the static approach, each substream declares a preset range of acceptable QoS levels (e.g., high, medium, low) instead of just a single one. As the availability of resources in the wireless network varies, the algorithm selects the best possible QoS level that each substream can obtain. In case of congestion, the algorithm attempts to free up some resources by degrading the QoS levels of the existing calls to lesser ones. This is done, however, under the constraint of achieving maximum utilization of the resources while simultaneously distributing them fairly among the calls. The degradation is limited to a minimum value predefined in a user defined profile (UDP). Genetic algorithms have been used to solve the optimization problem. From the user perspective, the perception of the QoS degradation is very graceful and happens only during over-load periods. The network services, on the other hand, are greatly enhanced due to the fact that the call blocking probability is significantly decreased. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs well in terms of increasing the number of admitted calls while utilizing the available bandwidth fairly and effectively.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.830030","startPage":"1500","endPage":"1504 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

Thus, third generation (3G) systems need to support high bit rates and packet data/IP access. 3G systems that provide high quality voice services as well as high speed packet data need a mechanism to share radio and network resources efficiently amongst prospective clients by utilizing the characteristics of the heterogeneous traffic. This paper is concerned with developing a \"burst switching\" technique as an efficient radio resource allocation scheme for a CDMA based 3G system that provides high speed packet data services. Conventional circuit and packet switching techniques become inefficient in providing wireless packet data services through CDMA due to poor resource utilization, and poor quality of service (QoS) characteristics, respectively. The proposed burst switching technique aims to overcome these problems by allocating radio resources to users for the duration of data bursts rather than an entire session or a single packet as in the case of circuit and packet switching, respectively, and releasing them at the end of the bursts for potential use by other clients. The ideal burst switching system would immediately release the physical layer resources at the beginning of the idle period following a packet burst. Its practical counterpart would make use of two timers that are used to release the physical and upper layer resources, respectively. This paper provides insights as to how these timer values should be selected to provide low delay packet service while maintaining efficient resource allocation to users.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

Several Doppler spectra are analyzed and compared, such as the classical and uniform distributions, as well as the case of two distinct values for the Doppler frequency.

Simulations using these ideal partial response channel models show gains exceeding 5 dB over uncoded systems at bit error rates of 10/sup -5/. Since the APP detectors of the turbo decoder assume uncorrelated Gaussian noise, the performance on more realistic channel models, using correlated and media-dependent noise, was unknown. In this work, we replace the white noise partial response channel model with more realistic channel models. First, the effects of colored noise are investigated with an equalized Lorentzian channel model. Then, media noise is added by incorporating the microtrack model into the system. Simulation results of the turbo decoding system with the various channel models are presented. Additionally, since the use of an outer Reed-Solomon code is anticipated in an actual system, the burst statistics at the error floor are investigated.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.830162","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

This simple iterative decoder achieves efficient cooperation between an outer Reed-Solomon error correction code (RS-ECC) decodes and a PRML trellis-detector. By using \"error-free\" decoded bit-information feedback from the outer RS-ECC decoder, the iterative scheme employs \"state pinning\" in the ML trellis-detector. This enables long error-events in the ML-decoded data to be corrected efficiently without adding extra coding redundancy and specific decoding complexity. The iterative scheme improves the correction capability of the outer RS-ECC coding by making use of a CRCC coding for specific correcting short error-events.

Blind soft-detection of the SFH/MC DS-CDMA signals is investigated, assuming that the receiver has no knowledge of the associated frequency-hopping (FH) patterns invoked. The system's performance is evaluated over the range of Nakagami (1960) multipath fading channels. The results show that the blind soft-detection not only achieves the required bit error rate performance, but it is also capable of blindly acquiring the FH patterns employed. This assists the mobile in accessing the network without the knowledge of the FH patterns or during soft hand-over.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

These applications require transmission of very high data rates and OFDM system are capable of providing frequency diversity without resorting to complex equalizers. To improve coverage and efficiency of the system some terrestrial broadcasting systems employ a network of single frequency transmitters all transmitting the same program synchronized in time and frequency. These single frequency networks (SFN) usually provide base station diversity, however, in some cases frequency diversity is not available when the path differences between the stations are very small. We address this situation and introduce a very simple transmit diversity technique. This diversity technique does not introduce any changes at the receiver.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.830195","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

LMDS has been widely recognized as an effective last mile solution to provide broadband wireless access to residential customers and businesses, and systems are presently under development. Successful deployment of LMDS services requires a thorough understanding of the effects of propagation at millimeter wave bands in a fixed cellular environment. The measurements provide various characteristics on excess path loss, average delay and delay spread, which give valuable insight into the wideband nature of the propagation channel. Based on these measurements a mathematical tapped delay line channel model was then developed that captures the time varying dispersive channel behavior more realistically.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

With a space-time filter, designed by singular-value-decomposition, the channel can be coordinated to obtain a higher receive SNR. With a coding scheme, the receive SNR is good enough to get coding gain, while the channel SNR is too low to obtain the benefits from coding.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

However, all standard compression techniques are strongly sensitive to channel noise and their application is suitable only for practically noiseless channels. For noisy channels it is reasonable to investigate an integrated source and channel coding method as a tradeoff between the image quality and the ability to control errors caused by noise. A real number (4,2) BCH code defined in the frequency domain via the DFT is presented. The major contribution of this paper is a new approach to decoding real number codes based on not only one but three syndromes which is not possible with binary codes. It is shown that a real number (4,2) code has the ability to correct up to 3 errors regardless of the presence of noise or even all i.e. four errors. The efficiency of the proposed decoding method is tested on a 2-D example of a gray scale image.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.830214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.830214","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

The noninteger ideal values are determined by the simultaneous adaptation of the equalizer coefficients, target coefficients and the ideal values themselves. The second part of the paper focuses on noninteger VA implementation. Noninteger ideal values in the VA make hardware realization of the VA complex because multiplication operations are required to compute the Euclidean distance branch metrics. A piecewise linear approximation to the Euclidean distance metric is introduced that simplifies realization of the VA by replacing the multiplications with digital left/right bit shifts and add operations. Performance of both the adaptive detection scheme and the piecewise linear approximation are assessed using data collected from a spin stand.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.830226","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

Most wideband and multicarrier uplink CDMA schemes suppress MUI statistically in the presence of unknown multipath and impose restrictive and difficult to check conditions on the FIR channel nulls. Relying on symbol blocking, we design a mutually-orthogonal usercode-receiver (AMOUR) system for quasi-synchronous blind CDMA that eliminates MUI deterministically and mitigates fading irrespective of the unknown multipath and the adopted signal constellation. AMOUR converts a multiuser CDMA system into parallel single-user systems irrespective of multipath and guarantees identifiability of users' symbols. Simulations reveal the generality, flexibility, and superior performance of AMOUR over competing alternatives.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

It is shown here that the receivers proposed are near-far resistant and exhibits lower complexity than the optimum detector. The incoherent realization allows a lighter complexity overhead for the synchronization circuitry. The receivers performance is expressed in terms of the bit error rate (BER) which has been derived by simulations under the assumption of a slowly frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

Traditional solutions for asynchronous linear MUD result in a prohibitively large decorrelation matrix. The new scheme transforms the asynchronous problem into a synchronous one by creating sub-symbols that are, by design, time-aligned with all other users and their respective multipath signals. The resulting decorrelation matrix is dramatically reduced in size, thus offering a viable solution for implementation.

Since current IP provides only best effort service, supporting quality of service (QoS) has become a crucial issue. We propose a simple, yet efficient priority scheme to support basic QoS at the WDM layer of the optical Internet. Unlike existing approaches that depend on buffers (queues) and scheduling algorithms (e.g., fair queuing), our scheme does not mandate any buffer in the WDM layer in order to differentiate the services. The proposed scheme is based on the concept of using an offset time between a control (set-up) packet and the corresponding data burst as in optical burst switching (OBS). More specifically, by assigning different offset times to different classes, it is possible for a higher priority class to be isolated from lower priority classes. We quantify the offset time required for class isolation, and analyze the blocking probability of each class.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.830240","pdfPath":"/iel5/6675/17972/00830240.pdf","startPage":"1023","endPage":"1027 vol. 1b","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

Although the conducting mechanism for both tests are at the Fowler-Nordheim tunneling regime, high-field constant voltage stress test is found to be a more sensitive test than Jramp for in-line production monitor.

This technique provides a straightforward method of extending conventional ramp breakdown techniques to ultra-thin dielectrics (<3.5 nm). This technique monitors the use-condition current (or current below stress current) after each stress-step in the ramp. We apply this method to a wide range of oxide areas and gate oxide thicknesses. We show for the first time that the post-stress leakage current is independent of oxide area over 7 orders of magnitude and for 5 oxide thickness from 20 nm to 2.3 nm. In addition, we show that the voltage ramp Weibull distribution statistics scale with area and are consistent with constant voltage stress tests on 2 nm gate oxides. We model the post-breakdown I-V characteristics and show a space-charge limited behavior. This observation is used to explain why a modified voltage ramp technique is needed for ultra-thin oxides and defect-detecting large area structures. Finally, we demonstrate that new noise techniques may be necessary to detect breakdown during constant voltage stress in ultra-thin gate oxides.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/830571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6589380","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Detecting breakdown in ultra-thin dielectrics using a fast voltage ramp","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting breakdown in ultra-thin dielectrics using a fast voltage ramp","confLoc":"Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00830571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031841S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"18011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6735","citationCount":"11","articleId":"830571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":830671,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Linsha","affiliation":["Xi'an Highway University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Jian Linsha","id":"37088129175"},{"name":"Zhou Guoping","affiliation":["Xi'an Highway University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Zhou Guoping","id":"37087878335"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5296-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"830671","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=830671","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Ignition","Neural networks","Engines","Appropriate technology","Paper technology","Sparks","Testing","Road transportation","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive electronics","diagnostic expert systems","fault diagnosis","knowledge acquisition","knowledge representation","electric ignition","neural nets","electrical engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","ignition system","neural network","ignition waveform","knowledge acquisition","knowledge representation","reasoning technology","neural network expert system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IVEC.1999.830671","pdfPath":"/iel5/6714/17971/00830671.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE International Vehicle Electronics Conference (IVEC'99) (Cat.

Our test outcomes show that, for a given set of real life financial data, MASFinance can automatically choose a near optimal simulation model (a NANN with a near optimal neuron activation function and near optimal numbers of hidden layers and units) and then simulates the data with a root-mean-squared error of less than 5%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/830766/","accessionNumber":"6609184","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-16 July 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A model auto-selection financial data simulation software using neuron-adaptive feedforward neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model auto-selection financial data simulation software using neuron-adaptive feedforward neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00830766.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027797S","chronDate":"Jul 1999","isNumber":"17953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6674","articleId":"830766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":830768,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this research, the grey theory applied include grey forecast model and grey relationship analysis. The grey forecast model, GM(1,1), was applied to predict the next day's stock index future. To examine the influence of dimension of the model to prediction accuracy, seven different kinds of dimension 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 15 were tested. The generated data were then regarded as new technical indices in grey relationship analysis and prediction of neural network. Grey relationship analysis was used to filter the most important quantitative technical indices. Finally, a recurrent neural network was developed to train and predict the price trend of stock index future. In the network structure, the price trend of stock index future is the output and the values gained from previous processing in grey relationship analysis is the input. The conclusion shows our models can provide good prediction for this problem.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.830769","startPage":"3850","endPage":"3855 vol.6","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

This method is based on a feedforward neural network (FNN), which uses a Gaussian function as the activation function of its hidden units and sigmoid as that of output unit. By training with samples collected from historical technological record, the static FNN model is built to fit the wafer fabrication process.

The problem of reconstructing the conductivity distribution inside an object from potential measurements on the surface is known to be ill-posed requiring efficient regularization techniques. We demonstrate that a statistical inverse solution, where the mean of the inverse mapping is approximated with a neural network gives promising results. We study the effect of input and output data representation by simulations and conclude that projection to principal axis is feasible data transformation. Also we demonstrate that Bayesian neural networks, which aim to average over all network models weighted by the model's posterior probability provide the best reconstruction results. With the presented approach estimation of some target variables, such as the void fraction (the ratio of gas and liquid), may be applicable directly without the actual image reconstruction. We also demonstrate that the solutions are very robust against noise in inputs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/830787/","accessionNumber":"6604734","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-16 July 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of Bayesian neural network in electrical impedance tomography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Bayesian neural network in electrical impedance tomography","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00830787.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045536S","chronDate":"Jul 1999","isNumber":"17953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6674","citationCount":"8","articleId":"830787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":830788,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For some eddy current transducers for flaw detection the mathematical models were constructed and the inverse problem (IP) were formulated In order to solve those problems the artificial neural network approach, relatively new, was adopted. The public domain software was used to teach and test the network. It was proved that, a standard feedforward multilayered neural network is sufficient to identify the parameters of different kind defects with a satisfying accuracy. Neural network approach could be extinguished to impedance tomography and to eddy current tomography. Several examples illustrated abilities of proposed approach will be presented in the paper. Two artificial neural network reconstruction methods for electrical impedance tomography have been presented in this paper. The problem under study concerns the reconstruction of the conductivity distribution inside the investigated area using the information collected from the boundary. The first approach consists in ANN learning using electrical potential vectors, which were obtained from numerical solution of the forward problems. The second method using a standard feedforward multilayered neural network applies the circuit representation for the finite element discretization. Using the quadrilateral finite element, the neural network structure for EIT problem has been proposed. The advantages and disadvantages of both methods with respect to the classical approach have been discussed in details.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.830804","startPage":"4027","endPage":"4032 vol.6","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

Training local committees is performed in two stages: active data partitioning and recombination by introducing an additional reject class. Active data partitioning is a preprocessing step that partitions the given dataset into several similar subsets using active learning. Additional reject class in this strategy plays an important role in assigning a focused area to each individual network of the committee. For combining the outputs of each individual network, we use a kind of sum rule criteria, assuming that the outputs of the individuals are equivalent to a posteriori Bayesian probabilities. All the learning procedures are based on the active learning paradigm. Experiments are performed on the two real-world datasets from the UCI machine learning database. The results show that the active data partitioning and recombining strategy is very successful for building a local committee and the combined result outperforms other algorithms, but the combined result can be affected by the training error level /spl epsiv/.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.830807","startPage":"4043","endPage":"4047 vol.6","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

The advanced learning algorithms are designed to treat all these three aspects during learning, guiding to dedicated solutions. In this paper, an evolutionary hybrid learning algorithm is presented to deal simultaneously with these three aspects. The essence of this approach is the existence of a search procedure based on a synergy between genetic algorithms and conjugate gradient optimization.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.830808","startPage":"4048","endPage":"4053 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

A two-stage system is proposed with the first stage containing three ANN forecasters. The first forecaster is a multilayer feedforward network trained with backpropagation, the second one is another multilayer feedforward network trained with Levenberg-Marquad algorithm, and the third one is a one-layer functional link network These three separate forecasts are nonlinearly combined in the second stage using a functional link ANN combiner. A scheme is introduced to make all of the ANNs adaptive, with their weights changing throughout the forecasting phase. The performance is tested on real data from four different gas utilities for a period of several months. The results show that the proposed forecast combination approach does result in more accurate forecasts compared to using a single forecaster. The overall performance of the system is also quite good from an operational point of view.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.830812","startPage":"4069","endPage":"4072 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

This hybrid network consists of a new neural blind de-mixer for approximating the post nonlinearity and a common network for separating the predicted linear mixtures. The blind de-mixer is made up of two subnets, which in total produce a \"weak\" nonlinear operator and can approach relatively strong nonlinearity by parameter-tuning.

A hybrid algorithm of NN and ROM performs a formation of a small-sized NN system, which is suitable for a rule extraction. In this paper iris data is used as inputs. ROM is utilized to reduce the number of connection weights in NN. The network weights survived after the ROM training represent regularities to perform pattern classification. The rules are then extracted from the networks in which hidden units use signum and sigmoid functions to produce binary outputs. It enables us to extract simple logical functions from the network.

Since the extended GA with neutral mutations adopts a redundant string representation, most genetic operations become neutral for an objective function. The proposed method is also an effective approach to nonstationary classification problems. It is observed that it overcomes the difficulty by the emergent property of finding deceptive hyperplanes and escaping the population from them by using the large genetic transitions to their complements.

(1996) have proposed a linguistic rule extraction method from trained neural networks for pattern classification problems. In the method, antecedent linguistic values such as \"small\" and \"large\" are used as inputs to a multilayer feedforward neural network for determining the consequent part of linguistic rules. Since the linguistic input values are handled as fuzzy numbers, the corresponding outputs from the neural network are also calculated as fuzzy numbers by fuzzy arithmetic. The accurate calculation of the fuzzy outputs is very important because the determination of the consequent part is based on the calculated fuzzy outputs. It is, however, well-known that fuzzy arithmetic involves excess fuzziness. In this paper, we illustrate how subdivision methods can decrease the excess fuzziness. We also examine the effect of those methods on the performance of our rule extraction method.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.830842","pdfPath":"/iel5/6674/17953/00830842.pdf","startPage":"4217","endPage":"4222 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

The localized range of activation of the hidden units have many similarities with rule-based representations. Neurofuzzy systems are a common example of a framework that explicitly integrates these approaches. Following this concept, we study alternatives for the development of hybrid rule-neural systems with the purpose of inducing robust and interpretable classifiers. Local fitting of parameters is done by a gradient descent optimization that modifies the covering produced by a rule induction algorithm. Two tasks are accomplished: how to select a small number of rules and how to improve precision. The use of this architecture is better suited when one wants to achieve a good compromise between classification performance and simplicity.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.830845","startPage":"4232","endPage":"4236 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

Normally, borehole drilling and geo-tomography (tomography perfected for subsurface exploration) are used to collect data and infer geological distributions. However, the reliability of inference is generally poor and identifying geological distribution is a human intensive process because: 1) boreholes provide information only at the point of drilling and it is hard to interpolate to other areas, and 2) it is difficult to interpret the geo-tomography images in geological terms due to scarcity of quantitative data. These limitations can be overcome by means of fuzzy-neural networks (NNs) and the prediction accuracy is significantly improved. We present a fuzzy-NN application to a spatial distribution prediction problem. Scarcity of data in the cross borehole region was supplemented by using fuzzy data extracted from man-made maps, as input that summarizes human perception of the region. A brief description of the method and a case study are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/830847/","accessionNumber":"6609231","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-16 July 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An application of spatial prediction using a fuzzy-neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An application of spatial prediction using a fuzzy-neural network","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00830847.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035142S","chronDate":"Jul 1999","isNumber":"17953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6674","citationCount":"1","articleId":"830847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":830851,"authors":[{"name":"L.N.

As a consequence, the learning process presents a better performance, with the final state of the neural network being kept away from undesired saturation regions. Based on a hybrid architecture combining a gradient strategy with a fuzzy decision model, an auto-tuning algorithm is derived to adjust additional parameters associated with the activation functions. The other conventional parameters, the connection weights between layers, are adjusted using a powerful second-order approach based on a conjugate gradient algorithm. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method we compare this technique with the standard algorithm and with an auto-tuning strategy based solely on the gradient descent method.

However, it is still an important problem to make fuzzy neural networks learn faster and to optimise membership functions of fuzzy rule based models to converge to a local minimum. Moreover, while learning faster and optimising, it is important to use less memory and to need less CPU time. In this paper, to overcome these problems, we propose non-normalised compensatory hybrid fuzzy neural networks (non-normalised CFBPNN) incorporating fuzzy c-means clustering as a fuzzy inference engine, fuzzy logic and backpropagation learning algorithms. The results have shown that the proposed algorithm overcomes these problems, and yields a very high performance. This algorithm was tested on the XOR problem, nonlinear function learning and pattern classification, and compared with normalised CFBPNN and BPNN to verify the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.830858","startPage":"4300","endPage":"4303 vol.6","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

At present, formal symbolic models are a reference point for using neural networks. Such an approach may be called top-down because it assumes that neural computations are based on a direct or indirect manipulation of structured symbolic representations. In this paper we present a bottom-up approach, in which we do not make such an assumption. Starting from a direct interpretation of performance of binary recurrent neural networks during processing of symbol sequences, a formal model of transducer was introduced. An exemplary definition of such a transducer and its application to a part-of-speech tagging problem is illustrated. From its operation we conclude that neural computations are non-structural and based not on manipulating symbolic structures but on the principle of causality.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transducers","Natural language processing","Neural networks","Computational modeling","Concurrent computing","Tagging","Turing machines","Recurrent neural networks","Neurons","Cybernetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural languages","symbol manipulation","recurrent neural nets","finite state machines","formal specification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","formal models","symbolic representations","bottom-up approach","recurrent neural networks","symbol sequences","finite-state transducers","part-of-speech tagging"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=830873","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.830873","startPage":"4375","endPage":"4380 vol.6","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

Recruitment curves were obtained for quadriceps, tibialis anterior and triceps surae/plantaris by stimulating their activation pools in the ventral horn of the feline spinal cord. Mean twitch times-to-peak for quadriceps, tibialis anterior and triceps surae/plantaris were 33.0, 41.0, and 36.0 ms, respectively. Twitch duration as a function of stimulus strength demonstrated a mixed motor unit recruitment order, distinctively different from the inverse recruitment order exhibited by conventional methods of electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve. The recruitment curve slopes (expressed as a percentage of maximum force per nanocurrent of delivered charge) were shallow: 7.9 for quadriceps, 2.6 for tibialis anterior and 8.5 for triceps surae/plantaris. These results show that graded control of force in individual muscles or muscle groups can be obtained through spinal cord stimulation, and suggest that spinal cord stimulation could be used for functional neuromuscular stimulation applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/830945/","volume":"8","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6565025","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"10779104","publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Muscle recruitment through electrical stimulation of the lumbo-sacral spinal cord","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Muscle recruitment through electrical stimulation of the lumbo-sacral spinal cord","sourcePdf":"00830945.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041806S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"18016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"51","articleId":"830945","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":830947,"authors":[{"name":"F.A.

Although many types of nerve electrodes have been designed to avoid or minimize this pressure during stimulation of the nerve or recording of its activity, the measurement of the pressure exerted by these cuffs has not been reported. Currently, only theoretical models are used to predict nerve cuff electrode pressures. The authors have developed a nerve cuff electrode pressure sensor to measure external pressures exerted by peripheral nerve cuff electrodes. The sensor has a high sensitivity, linear response with little hysteresis and reproducible output. Pressure measurements have been obtained for split-ring and spiral cuff electrodes. The measurements obtained are in agreement with theoretical predictions. Moreover, they indicate that the pressures exerted by cuffs currently used for stimulation generate only a small amount of pressure, which is below the pressure required to occlude blood flow in nerves. The results also suggest that this new sensor can provide reliable measurement of external pressures exerted by nerve electrodes and would be an important tool for comparing various nerve cuff electrode designs.","doi":"10.1109/86.830947","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/86/18016/00830947.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.830947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement of external pressures generated by nerve cuff electrodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/830947/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"Measurement of external pressures generated by nerve cuff electrodes","volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6565027","pubMedId":"10779106","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement of external pressures generated by nerve cuff electrodes","sourcePdf":"00830947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06784S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"18016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"24","articleId":"830947","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":830948,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Results from previous experiments using the pattern generator/pattern shaper (PG/PS) controller to generate isometric contractions demonstrated its ability to adjust stimulation patterns to account for recruitment nonlinearities and muscle dynamics. In this study, the PG/PS controller was tested under isotonic conditions. This evaluation required the PG/PS controller to account for muscle length-tension and force-velocity properties as well as limb dynamics. The performance of the adaptive controller was also compared with that of a proportional-derivative (PD) feedback controller. The PG/PS controller is composed of a neural network system that adaptively filters a periodic signal to produce a muscle stimulation pattern for generating cyclic movements. We used computer-simulated models to determine controller parameters for the PG/PS and PD controller that perform well across a variety of musculoskeletal systems. The controllers were then experimentally evaluated on both legs of two subjects with spinal cord injury. Results indicated that the PG/PS controller was able to achieve and maintain better tracking performance than the PD controller. This study indicates that the PG/PS control system may provide an effective mechanism for automatically customizing stimulation patterns for individuals using FNS systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/830948/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6565028","pubMedId":"10779107","volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive neural network control of cyclic movements using functional neuromuscular stimulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive neural network control of cyclic movements using functional neuromuscular stimulation","sourcePdf":"00830948.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065426S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"18016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"63","articleId":"830948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":830951,"authors":[{"name":"V.D.

Nonlinearities and time-variations of the dynamics of the plant, in addition to redundancy and dynamic uncertainty during the double support phase of walking, makes conventional control methods very difficult to use. Rule-based control, which uses a knowledge base determined by machine learning and finite automata method is limited since it does not respond well to perturbations and environmental changes. FEL can be regarded as a hybrid control, because it combines nonparametric identification with parametric modeling and control. This paper presents simulation of a powered trans-femoral prosthesis controlled by a FEL neural network. Results suggest that FEL can be used to identify inverse dynamics of an arbitrary trans-femoral prosthesis during simple single joint movements (e.g., sinusoidal oscillations). The identified inverse dynamics then allows the tracking of an arbitrary trajectory such as a desired walking pattern within a multijoint structure. Simulation shows that the identified controller responds correctly when the leg motion is exposed to a perturbation such as a frequent change of the ground reaction force or the hip joint torque generated by the user. FEL eliminates the need for precise, tedious, and complex identification of model parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/830951/","volume":"8","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6565031","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"10779110","publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Feedback error learning neural network for trans-femoral prosthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback error learning neural network for trans-femoral prosthesis","sourcePdf":"00830951.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059616S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"18016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"41","articleId":"830951","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":830955,"authors":[{"name":"D.G.

The paper briefly summarizes the requirements of head-operated mouse pointer control for people with disabilities before discussing a set of technological approaches that can be used to satisfy these requirements. The paper focuses on the design of a head-operated joystick that uses infrared light emitting diodes (LED's) and photodetectors to determine head position, which is subsequently converted into signals that emulate a Microsoft mouse. There are two significant findings. The first is that, while nonideal device characteristics might appear to make the joystick difficult to use users naturally compensate for nonlinearities, in a transparent manner, because of visual feedback of mouse pointer position. The second finding, from relatively informal, independent trials, indicates that disabled users prefer a head-operated device that has the characteristics of a joystick (a relative pointing device) to those of a mouse (an absolute pointing device).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/830955/","volume":"8","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6565035","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"10779114","publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Controlling mouse pointer position using an infrared head-operated joystick","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Controlling mouse pointer position using an infrared head-operated joystick","sourcePdf":"00830955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024975S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"18016","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"93","articleId":"830955","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":830970,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A response time of 1.0 s and a sensitivity of 30.0 fF/%RH have been obtained. High speed is achieved using multiple polyimide columns having diameters of a few microns and allowing moisture to diffuse into them circumferentially. Using structures that eliminate the air-gap capacitance between the columns, the simulated sensor output drifts by only 1% when the relative dielectric constant in the air region changes from 1 to 10. A polysilicon heater is used to measure relative humidity levels >80% RH. An accuracy of /spl plusmn/3% RH has been obtained using this method, with measurement errors of /spl plusmn/0.5/spl deg/C and /spl plusmn/2% RH in temperature and relative humidity, respectively. The heater also reduces the recovery time after wetting, enables the sensor to recover from contamination and aging, and allows the sensing film to be reset on demand during self-test protocols.","doi":"10.1109/16.830983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/18018/00830983.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.830983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18018","startPage":"702","endPage":"710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-speed capacitive humidity sensor with on-chip thermal reset","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=830983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A high-speed capacitive humidity sensor with on-chip thermal reset","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/830983/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6562433","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-speed capacitive humidity sensor with on-chip thermal reset","sourcePdf":"00830983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059899S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"18018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"164","articleId":"830983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":830987,"authors":[{"name":"T.E.

The method addresses issues of substrate coupling and contact effects and is therefore suitable for measurements with lossy technologies such as CMOS. The method assumes a probe-tip two-port calibration performed with well-known techniques and impedance substrates. By employing a physical interpretation of the test-fixture, the method alleviates a number of known problems with common de-embedding procedures. Four distinct mathematical steps are suggested to de-embed parasitics for the test-fixture to give an accurate measurement of the device under test. By introducing a simple compensation factor for in-fixture standard imperfections, the proposed method allows large devices to be measured with high accuracy. The applicability of the method is demonstrated with measurements up to 12 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/16.830987","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/18018/00830987.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.830987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18018","startPage":"734","endPage":"740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A four-step method for de-embedding gigahertz on-wafer CMOS measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=830987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A four-step method for de-embedding gigahertz on-wafer CMOS measurements","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/830987/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6562437","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A four-step method for de-embedding gigahertz on-wafer CMOS measurements","sourcePdf":"00830987.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028678S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"18018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"134","articleId":"830987","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":830988,"authors":[{"name":"H.

For complete dielectric breakdown, it has been clarified that the R/sub bd/ distribution under the substrate electron injection is clearly different from that under the gate electron injection.

A physical stress-enhanced bond-breaking model is proposed to explain this. The oxide breakdown mechanism is very closely related to the Si-Si bond formation from the breakage of Si-O-Si bond, and that is influenced by the physical stress in the film. The interfacial stress is generated due to the volume expansion from Si to SiO/sub 2/ during the thermal oxidation, and it is a strong function of growth conditions, such as temperature, growth rate, and growth ambient. Higher temperatures, lower oxidation rates, and higher steam concentrations allow faster stress relaxation through viscous flow. Reduced disorder at the interface results in better reliability. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) technique has been used to characterize stress in thin oxide films grown by both furnace and rapid thermal process (RTP). In conjunction with the Gibbs free energy theory, this model successfully predicts the trends of time-to-breakdown (t/sub bd/) as a function of oxide thickness and growth conditions. The trends of predicted t/sub bd/ values agree well with the experimental data from the electrical measurement.","doi":"10.1109/16.830989","startPage":"746","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/18018/00830989.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.830989","endPage":"755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of physical stress on the degradation of thin SiO/sub 2/ films under electrical stress","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/830989/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","displayDocTitle":"Effect of physical stress on the degradation of thin SiO/sub 2/ films under electrical stress","volume":"47","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6562439","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of physical stress on the degradation of thin SiO/sub 2/ films under electrical stress","sourcePdf":"00830989.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151994S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"18018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"59","articleId":"830989","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":830993,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The study is done by using an efficient statistical three-dimensional (3D) \"atomistic\" simulation technique. MOSFETs with uniform channel doping and with low doped epitaxial channels have been investigated. The simulations reveal that even in devices with a single crystal gate the gate depletion and the random dopants in it are responsible for a substantial fraction of the threshold voltage fluctuations when the gate oxide is scaled to thickness in the range of 1-2 nm. Simulation experiments have been used in order to separate the enhancement in the threshold voltage fluctuations due to an effective increase in the oxide thickness associated with the gate depletion from the direct influence of the random dopants in the gate depletion layer. The results of the experiments show that the both factors contribute to the enhancement of the threshold voltage fluctuations, but the effective increase in the oxide thickness has a dominant effect in the investigated range of devices. Simulations illustrating the effect of the polysilicon grain boundaries on the threshold voltage variation are also presented.","doi":"10.1109/16.830997","startPage":"805","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/18018/00830997.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.830997","endPage":"812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polysilicon gate enhancement of the random dopant induced threshold voltage fluctuations in sub-100 nm MOSFETs with ultrathin gate oxide","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/830997/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","displayDocTitle":"Polysilicon gate enhancement of the random dopant induced threshold voltage fluctuations in sub-100 nm MOSFETs with ultrathin gate oxide","volume":"47","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6562447","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polysilicon gate enhancement of the random dopant induced threshold voltage fluctuations in sub-100 nm MOSFETs with ultrathin gate oxide","sourcePdf":"00830997.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035822S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"18018","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"48","articleId":"830997","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":831000,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Several methods, such as electrooptic modulation, can be used to produce the phase modulation. In this paper, we concentrate on the parametric mixing of a signal waveform with a linearly chirped optical pump as the time lens mechanism.

The results show that the tree-structured neural network approximates decision regions much more parsimoniously than Kohonen and reduced Coulomb-potential networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/831056/","accessionNumber":"6577152","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-16 July 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Approximation of chaotic shapes with tree-structured neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximation of chaotic shapes with tree-structured neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00831056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065416S","chronDate":"Jul 1999","isNumber":"17955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6674","articleId":"831056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":831057,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In LS-SVMs the Mercer condition is still applicable. Hence several type of kernels such as polynomial, RBFs and MLPs can be used. The multiclass case that we discuss here is related to classical neural net approaches for classification where multi-classes are encoded by considering multiple outputs for the network.

However, in a natural setting the categories should emerge from learning from a set of exemplars instead of prototypes. Still even if the problem of learning from correlated items has been solved, the selection of the right size for a category remain an open question. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the introduction of a vigilance parameter which specifies the degree to which patterns must be similar in order to be considered exemplars of the same prototype can be implemented in a general correlational neural network. The results show that this is the case and the number of the resulting categories vary as a function of the value of the vigilance parameter It is thus concluded that such a vigilance parameter may constitute the key to self-scaling adaptation in unsupervised correlational neural network.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.831108","startPage":"1092","endPage":"1096 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

The problem of finding fixed-length vector representations for labelled directed ordered acyclic graphs (DOAGs) can be regarded as a feature extraction problem in which the dimensionality of the input space is infinite.

Typically, it is a very time-consuming process to train a neural network for a given problem. However, when a new problem is presented, the neural network has to go through the learning process again without any benefit from the previous learning process. In order to address this problem, we propose a new architecture of neural networks that have the capability to remember past experiences and utilize them to solve a new problem faster and more efficiently. The proposed neural network consists of a primary neural network and a number of control neural networks.

The architecture has all the advantages of previous models such as self-organization and possesses new or superior characteristics such as input parallelism and decision making based on consensus. Due to the parallel properties of this network its parallel implementation on an N-cube machine was also studied. The architecture self organizes its modules to maximize performance. Since the system is completely parallel, both recall and learning procedures are very fast. The performance of the network was compared to backpropagation networks in problems of language perception remote sensing and binary logic (Exclusive-Or). PSCNN showed superior performance in all cases studied. In the research reported in the paper, we demonstrate and test the development of the PSCNN's architecture as well as its training rules. In addition, the performance of this new PSCNN system is compared to the performance of backpropagation models.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.831135","startPage":"1225","endPage":"1228 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

A second derivative of validation error based regularization algorithm (SDVR) is derived using the Gauss-Newton approximation to the Hessian. The basic algorithm, which uses incremental updating, allows the regularization parameter /spl alpha/ to be recalculated in each training epoch. Two variations of the algorithm, called convergent updating and conditional updating, enable /spl alpha/ to be updated over a variable interval according to the specified control criteria. Simulations on a noise-corrupted parabolic function with two-inputs and a single output are investigated. The results demonstrate that the SDVR framework is very promising for adaptive regularization and can be cost effectively applied to a variety of different problems.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.831145","startPage":"1275","endPage":"1280 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

These adjustments are carried out either iteratively, by interneural bond weight gradual slaving, or directly, by calculation using storable data values. The latter approach, due to Hopfield (1982), is noniterative. Iterative methods require reiteration of the whole storable information, which limits their practical usage. On the other hand, despite high storage speed, the Hopfield net has not gained wide popularity because of its small associative memory capacity, the impossibility of erasing out-of-date information, and loss of stability when supersaturating the memory. Personnaz et al. (1986) proposed an exact projection (pseudo-inverse) bond weight computation algorithm, which doubles the amount of storable data size and resolved the problem of Hopfield network instability. Reznik and Gorodnichy (1996, 1997) studied the effect of the synaptic matrix deformation on the pseudo-inverse networks behaviour and proposed the memory desaturation technique which allowed to double again the capacity of the network. Later, this technique lead us to the dynamic desaturation technique which made the gradual release of memory from obsolete information possible. In this work we present the results of our investigation into noniterative learning methods for neural networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/831163/","accessionNumber":"6577246","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-16 July 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Non-iterative learning for neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-iterative learning for neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00831163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046684S","chronDate":"Jul 1999","isNumber":"17955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6674","citationCount":"5","articleId":"831163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":831164,"authors":[{"name":"Jiang Minghu","affiliation":["The State Key Lab of Intelligent Tech. & Systems, Department of Computer, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jiang Minghu","id":"37087393699"},{"name":"Zhu Xiaoyan","affiliation":["The State Key Lab of Intelligent Tech. & Systems, Department of Computer, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhu Xiaoyan","id":"37087878089"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5529-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7576"}],"articleNumber":"831164","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=831164","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Convergence","IEEE members","Intelligent systems","Intelligent networks","Computer networks","Counting circuits","Learning systems","Merging","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","unsupervised learning","backpropagation","speech recognition","convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast learning algorithms","time-delay neural networks","Waibel neural networks","unsupervised learning","Oja rule","error backpropagation","convergence","phoneme recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.831164","pdfPath":"/iel5/6674/17955/00831164.pdf","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

The method is applied to train perceptrons by means of Gaussian mixture inputs, as a particular example for the generalized Softmax perceptron (GSP) network. The method has the advantage of providing a clear distinction between the network architecture and the model of the data constraints, giving network parameters or weights on one side and data over parameters on the other. MLE stochastic gradient based rules are obtained for JNDDE.

The relationship between entropy and the expected volume and mass of a convex hull constructed from n sample points is examined. We show that minimizing the expected hull volume may have more desirable gradient dynamics when compared to minimizing entropy. We show that entropy by itself has some geometrical invariance with respect to expected hull volumes. We develop closed form expressions for the expected convex hull mass and volumes in R/sup 1/ and relate these to error probability.

The algorithm is based on a quadratic approximation of a suitably defined merit function and generates sequences of LMI feasible iterates. The main thrust of the algorithm is that it inherits the good local convergence properties of Newton methods and thus overcomes the difficulties encountered with earlier methods such as the Frank and Wolfe or conditional gradient methods which tend to be very slow in the neighborhood of a local solution. Moreover, it is easily implemented using available Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) codes. Proposed algorithms have proven global and local convergence properties and thus represent improvements over classically used D-K iteration schemes but also outperform earlier conditional gradient algorithms.

The SS approach has gained popularity since it only requires the determination of one structural parameter. It has also empirically been found to provide models with good accuracy in many cases. However, SS has some drawbacks: there is no well established method tied to this approach for determining the structural parameter and, perhaps more importantly, the SS parameter estimates depend on the data in a rather complicated way, which renders almost futile any attempt to analyze and optimize the performance of the estimator. We propose an alternative to the SS approach based on a transfer function (TF) model and instrumental variables (IVs). The simplest canonical parameterization of the TF is used; the denominator consists of a scalar polynomial times the identity matrix. The analysis and performance optimization of the TF approach is shown to be relatively straightforward. A statistical test for estimating the single structural parameter needed is also presented. Simulations show that TF can provide more accurate models than SS at a lower computational cost.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transfer functions","MIMO","System identification","Structural engineering","Instruments","Performance analysis","Linear systems","Parameter estimation","Optimization methods","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","linear systems","MIMO systems","transfer functions","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO system identification","transfer function approach","instrumental variables","subspace approximations","canonical parameterization","identity matrix","statistical test"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=831284","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1999.831284","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 38th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

In particular, it is proved that exponential stability is achieved when the number of switches in any finite interval grows linearly with the length of the interval, and the growth rate is sufficiently small. Moreover, the exponential stability is uniform over all switchings with the above property. For switched systems with inputs this guarantees that several input-to-state induced norms are bounded uniformly over all slow-on-the-average switchings. These results extend to classes of nonlinear switched systems that satisfy suitable uniformity assumptions. In this paper it is also shown that, in a supervisory control context, scale-independent hysteresis can produce switching that is slow-on-the-average and therefore the results mentioned above can be used to study the stability of hysteresis-based adaptive control systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/831330/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"6545387","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stability of switched systems with average dwell-time","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of switched systems with average dwell-time","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00831330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069488S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"18008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6713","citationCount":"882","articleId":"831330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":831396,"authors":[{"name":"H.D.

A hardware-software codesign approach is used to design the finite field datapath in a domain-specific digital signal processor (DSP) with low-energy RS codecs application in mind. These datapaths are designed to accommodate programmability with respect to the primitive polynomial as well as the field degree m. A novel heterogeneous digit-serial approach is proposed, where the heterogeneity corresponds to the use of different digit sizes in the multiply-accumulate (MAC) and degree reduction (DEGRED) subarrays. The salient feature of this digit-serial approach is that only the digit cells are implemented in hardware and the finite field multiplications are performed digit-serially in software by dynamically scheduling the internal digit-level operations. Efficient scheduling strategies for digit-serial finite field multiplications are presented and applied to the design of low-energy high-performance RS codecs in software. Significant energy and energy-latency reductions can be achieved using the digit-serial datapaths, as compared with the traditional approach where a combined MAC-DEGRED (parallel multiplier) unit is used. It is concluded that for two-error-correcting RS(n, k) codes over finite field GF(2/sup 8/), datapath containing a parallel MAC unit (of digit size eight) and a DEGRED unit with digit size two (or four) leads to RS codecs with the least energy consumption and energy-latency products; with these datapath architectures and appropriate digit-serial scheduling strategies, more than 60% energy reduction and more than one-third energy-latency reduction can be achieved compared with the parallel multiplication datapath-based approach.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/18023/00831436.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware/software codesign of finite field datapath for low-energy Reed-Solomon codecs","doi":"10.1109/92.831436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18023","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.831436","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=831436","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/831436/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2000","displayDocTitle":"Hardware/software codesign of finite field datapath for low-energy Reed-Solomon codecs","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6581375","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware/software codesign of finite field datapath for low-energy Reed-Solomon codecs","sourcePdf":"00831436.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048259S","chronDate":"April  2000","isNumber":"18023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"18","articleId":"831436","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":831438,"authors":[{"name":"J.

There are two ways of specifying the protocol, the language of communication. One way is to specify the automaton that recognizes the language, and this is the approach taken by SDL, etc. The other more abstract way ss to specify the grammar of the language and let a tool synthesize the automaton. Directly specifying the automaton makes the specification implementation dependent in two ways: the time behavior is specified in terms of states, and the width of the inputs and outputs is fixed. By specifying the grammar, the specification is potentially independent of both these implementation details and allows design space exploration in these dimensions. This paper presents a grammar-based language, called Program, that supports a port-size independent specifications methodology and its application to parts of the Operation and Maintenance protocol, a typical application from the ATM world. The methodology has also been applied to another test set of example designs and compared to standard RTL synthesis and HLS in order to evaluate the quality of the produced designs.","doi":"10.1109/92.831438","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/18023/00831438.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.831438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18023","startPage":"184","endPage":"194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grammar-based hardware synthesis from port-size independent specifications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=831438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Grammar-based hardware synthesis from port-size independent specifications","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/831438/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6581377","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grammar-based hardware synthesis from port-size independent specifications","sourcePdf":"00831438.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071003S","chronDate":"April  2000","isNumber":"18023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"13","articleId":"831438","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":831441,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Networks that develop independent components (ICs) in an efficient manner can be built from two stages. We identify, these stages with the CA3 and CAI layers of the hippocampus (HC). The forming of ICs requires nonlinear operation, whereas IC outputs arise under linear operation and thus two-phase operation follows. Concurrent occurrences of past and present events are required by Hebbian learning and can be achieved by delaying structures. The loop structure requires a third layer that we identify with the entorhinal cortex (EC). Proper encoding into the EC is possible during linear operation in a supervised manner. The DRN can be seen as an error compensating control architecture. Thus the novel information processed by the DRN may be temporally convolved. We assume that blind source deconvolution is executed by the dentate gyrus and show that the dentate gyrus can satisfy the requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/831456/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-16 July 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6571801","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Computational model of the entorhinal-hippocampal region derived from a single principle","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational model of the entorhinal-hippocampal region derived from a single principle","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00831456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039397S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6674","articleId":"831456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":831457,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The formed memory traces change network activity that is the basis of categorization according to the model. This change depends on the structure of the lateral connectivity and on the stimuli used in demonstrations.

Therefore its disorders produce strange phenomena. In a previous study, it was observed that a sensorimotor coordinated neural network model generates a trained pattern reversely when some special condition is provided. In this paper, computer simulation studies are performed from the viewpoints of neural information processing to investigate its sensorimotor coordination which is developed throughout the training. From the results, it is found that the way for information integration developed antagonistically or not plays an important role in performing signal transformation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/831490/","accessionNumber":"6576482","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-16 July 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Acquired sensorimotor coordinated signal transformation in a bi-directional neural network model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acquired sensorimotor coordinated signal transformation in a bi-directional neural network model","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00831490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029946S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6674","citationCount":"1","articleId":"831490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":831491,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Li","affiliation":["Department of Physiology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Yong Li","id":"37087216852"},{"name":"Ning Lan","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering Rehabilitation Engineering Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Ning Lan","id":"37086969262"},{"name":"Fusheng Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Fusheng Yang","id":"37087217557"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5529-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7576"}],"articleNumber":"831491","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":20},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neuromuscular","Neural networks","Intelligent networks","Elbow","Signal restoration","Signal generators","Recurrent neural networks","Spinal cord","Control systems","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuromuscular stimulation","biocontrol","recurrent neural nets","patient rehabilitation","learning (artificial intelligence)","identification","biomechanics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse identification","neuromuscular system","elbow function self-correcting system","elbow functional restoration","stimulating signals","paraplegia patients","physiological parameters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=831491","abstract":"Elbow functional restoration is a way to generate stimulating signals to help paraplegia patients restore their movement function.

Selection of the proper parameters for the implementation usually requires analysis by an expert familiar with the application targeted. Once suitable parameters have been selected, the PCNNf procedure is very robust, and can typically be used in a large number of situations similar to the original application. The purpose of this research is to advance the methodology for selecting parameters with reduced input from experts.

Additionally, in applications involving forecasting and fault diagnosis the availability of multistep-ahead predictors (MSP) is desired. MSPs are difficult to design because lack of measurements in the prediction horizon necessitates the recursive use of single-step-ahead predictors for reaching the final point in the horizon. Even small prediction errors resulting from noise at each point in the horizon accumulate and propagate, often resulting in poor prediction accuracy. We present a method for designing MSP using dynamic recurrent neural networks. The method is based on a dynamic gradient descent learning algorithm and its effectiveness is demonstrated through applications to an open-loop unstable process system, namely a heat-exchanger.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.831517","startPage":"349","endPage":"352 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

The weighted fan-in activation function corresponds to Euclidean distance functions used to compute similarities between input and weight vector. Replacing the fan-in activation function by non-Euclidean distance function offers a natural generalization of the standard MLP model, providing more flexible decision borders. An alternative way leading to similar results is based on renormalization of the input vectors using non-Euclidean norms in extended feature spaces. Both approaches influence the shapes of decision borders dramatically, allowing to reduce the complexity of MLP networks.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.831572","startPage":"631","endPage":"636 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

The proposed algorithm finds the minimum number of crossings or on approximation thereof and also provides a liner embedding realizing the number of crossings found. The problem can be defined as a \"set selection problem\". The results of solving the graph layout problem using a simulator of SDNN/V show that the computation time in parallel execution only requires three steps to derive one of near-optimum solutions.

Following the lead of Hopfield (1982, 1984) who exploited the formal analogy of a fully-connected ANN to an infinite ranged interaction Ising model, we have carried through a similar development to demonstrate that self-trapping networks (STNs) with only near-neighbor synapses develop attractor states through localization of a self-trapping input. The attractor states of the STN are the stored memories of this system, and are analogous to the magnetization developed in a self-trapping 1D Ising system. Post-synaptic potentials for each stored memory become trapped at non-zero valves and a sparsely-connected network evolves to the corresponding state.

The design of high-capacity WLANs is impeded mainly by the impairments of the indoor channel and by bandwidth and transmit-power restrictions. To mitigate these, Vandenameele et al. (1999) proposed an OFDM/SDMA approach that combines the advantages of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with those of space division multiple access (SDMA). However, the comparison of two uplink OFDM/SDMA algorithms, respectively based on the minimum-mean-squared-error and maximum-likelihood criterion, revealed a serious performance and complexity gap between them. In this paper, we propose a novel class of uplink OFDM/SDMA algorithms that bridge this gap. To this end, we introduce per-carrier successive interference cancellation and interference-dependent state insertion. Compared to the minimum-mean-squared-error approach, a performance gain of 10 dB is obtained for a BER of 10/sup -3/ This improvement comes at less than three times the initial implementation cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

For bit rates not exceeding 14.4 kbit/s, the rate information is not provided to the receiver and therefore has to be detected by hypothesis testing called blind rate detection. In this paper, a novel two-stage rate detection algorithm is proposed. First, a coarse rate estimation is performed. Through verifying the estimation using a second criterion, the data rate can be detected with a high probability without testing all possible data rates. Using this algorithm, 91% of the received frames need to be decoded only once resulting in a significantly decreased power consumption of the channel decoder of 60% without having any performance loss when compared to conventional rate detection.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.831618","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

In this paper a semi-analytical approach to the performance, including channel coding is presented. Furthermore we analyse the pre-RAKE performance including its behaviour with changing channels. Finally we show that the pre-RAKE maximises the correlation between the received and the desired signal, and this demonstration provides us the means to obtain an instant power control at bit level that improves performance significantly.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.831619","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

For portable terminals, it is difficult to adopt a linear amplifier because high power efficiency is needed. To solve the problem mentioned above, we propose a time division duplex (TDD) code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system which uses an asymmetric modulation between the forward and the reverse link. The system consists of multicarrier modulation for the forward link and single carrier modulation for the reverse link. A pre-equalization method for the forward link transmission is also presented in this paper.

Asynchronous users and multipath fading phenomena are considered. The proposed receiver, named the one-shot detector is supposed to be used at the end of an uplink terrestrial channel. The one-shot receiver basic assumption is to divide signals into reliable and unreliable ones. The reliable signals are directly detected and cancelled from the whole received signal so as to improve the decision on unreliable signals. A suitable analytical approach is proposed in order to evaluate error probability (P/sub e/) of the receiver under consideration. Simulation results are also presented to validate obtained analytical predictions. The results shown here clearly demonstrate that the proposed receiver exhibits better performance and lowers the computational complexity and processing delay in comparison with previously proposed alternatives.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-shot multi-user cancellation receiver for wireless CDMA communication systems","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

Fueled by this new requirement, the network operators are also considering other, profitable services that make use of the mobile location. With code-division multiple access (CDMA) being deployed by a variety of cellular and PCS providers in the form of the IS-95 standard, developing an approach for location in CDMA networks is imperative. This paper is concerned with developing a solution that does not require any changes to the existing cellular standard nor any changes to the mobile station architecture. Results of field trials conducted in boroughs of New York City are introduced to show the accuracy and shortcomings of the technique. Application of this technique to provide a zone-based billing service is also introduced in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.831624","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

We partitioned the datapath of the Viterbi decoder into largely 3 pipeline stages and to reduce the operation overhead of the add-compare-select unit (ACSU), removed the minimum metric selection logic and exploited constant subtraction scheme for the metric rescaling. This can be done by using unsigned arithmetic and the overflow detection unit. We also discuss unnecessity of minimum metric selection logic in the point of truncation effects. Simulation results demonstrate that if the traceback depth is set long enough, the arbitrary state decoding can be used without much disadvantage over the best state decoding. The survival memory unit (SMU) pipelining architecture based on the modified traceback algorithm is also presented. By exploiting the 2 registers and multiplexer, we made one-stage pipeline cell and by cascading them, the traceback operation without LIFO or some complex memory controller can be achieved with a latency of only 2T.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined VLSI architecture of the Viterbi decoder for IMT-2000","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.831627","startPage":"158","endPage":"162 vol.1a","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.831627","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17892","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

We consider and evaluate different spreading strategies for the DRS framework. Fixed spreading gain (FSG), variable spreading gain (VSG) and multi-code (MC) strategies are examined, and their performance is compared in terms of power saving, resource allocation and QoS stability. The VSG-DRS and MC-DRS outperform the FSG-DRS for capacity as a result of the statistical multiplexing gain created by adaptive bandwidth usage. However, MC-DRS is found to be less stable than the other schemes in QoS maintenance. The VSG-DRS is concluded to be the best compromise in terms of resource allocation, power consumption and stable QoS.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.831632","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

By using multiple code channels simultaneously, the protocol is capable of delivering high bit rates without sacrificing processing gain. The protocol combines reservations, time division duplexing and dynamic time division multiple access (TDD/DTDMA) to arbitrate the access of variable length packets from various appliances. A soft blocking prevention scheme is also developed to reduce the failure probability of reservation requests which are submitted in code division multiplexing (CDM) manner.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

When a satellite communicating with a mobile terminal (MT) is shadowed or when the coverage area of a satellite moves out of range of an MT, a handoff occurs. The handoff problem of LEO satellite communication systems is analyzed. The shadowing process of each satellite is modeled as an elevation angle dependent two-state continuous time Markov model. The probability distribution of multiple satellite visibility, which is used in the analysis, is also analytically obtained. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in terms of the call blocking probability and the average number of handoffs during a call.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.831649","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

In the receiver the likelihood ratio test is made by using the photocounts obtained by the intensities in the weighted positions of the signature sequence. Before the test, two OHLs enable the proposed receiver to remove the effect of the multiaccess interference (MAI), without knowledge of other users: in this sense it is a blind receiver. This blindness leads the proposed receiver to be a much simpler receiver than the multiuser receivers. We analyze the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed receiver in the optical CDMA system using optical orthogonal codes (OOCs).

Among the existing methods, some assume the chip timing and/or channel to be known, but in the most challenging approach neither is assumed to be known, and independent component analysis (ICA) can be used. A drawback of the ICA methods in CDMA is that they do not utilize the known code which is the only a prior information available. In this paper we remove this disadvantage and introduce a way to efficiently exploit the known code information in ICA methods. Experiments with DS-CDMA downlink data, and the previously reported linear ICA method show that the scheme gives the possibility to reach a performance which is competitive with the blind linear MMSE detector, and the traditional single user detector. The experiments speaks for the usefulness of the scheme especially in a severe multipath environment, where channel and chip timing estimation errors are more likely to occur, usually quite dramatically degrading the estimation performance.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.831657","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

The proposed receiver consists of a RAKE receiver, multiuser detector, multiple access interference cancellation, soft-decision channel decoder and decision feedback from the decoder. The conventional and our generalized multistage multiuser detectors are both simulated in the proposed receiver. The simulation results show that the interference cancellation based receiver significantly outperforms the traditional receiver. The performance of our generalized detector without feedback approaches or even exceeds the performance of the conventional multistage detector with feedback. It means that 50% of the implementation complexity can be saved. Furthermore, the processing delay of the interleaving introduced by decision feedback can also be avoided.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.831682","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

To obtain adequate performance multiuser receivers, such as LMMSE receivers, can be used. Unfortunately, previously suggested LMMSE receivers cannot be applied in WCDMA systems employing long scrambling codes. In this paper, linear receivers suitable also for downlink with long scrambling codes are studied. These receivers equalize the channel prior to the despreading, thus restoring the orthogonality of users and suppressing multiple access interference (MAI).

The delay spread for an indoor environment is typically around 100 ns, which cannot be resolved by a CDMA receiver with an 813 ns chip interval. In this situation, the conventional maximal ratio combiner (MRC) RAKE receiver sets to unity the number of branches and diversity gain is not available. Resolution reduction (RR) of the diversity receiver branches is a technique that improves the performance of CDMA systems in channels where the delay spread is smaller than the chip duration. A new resolution reduction technique based on the use of a minimum mean square error diversity combiner (MMSEC) is proposed in this work. A detailed study of the performance of a dual-branch MMSEC-RAKE receiver with RR in a typical indoor office environment is presented. We show that, under very general assumptions, this new method of RR is optimal and provides a 1.2 dB improvement over the previously RR proposed technique based on MRC, and 3.6 dB improvement over conventional MRC-RAKE receiver without RR, at a frame error rate (FER) of 0.01 for the IS-95 system downlink.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/831694/","isConference":true,"volume":"1A","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6629266","conferenceDate":"5-9 Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"MMSEC-RAKE receivers with resolution reduction of the diversity branches: analysis, simulation and applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSEC-RAKE receivers with resolution reduction of the diversity branches: analysis, simulation and applications","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"00831694.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042575S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6675","citationCount":"5","articleId":"831694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":831695,"authors":[{"name":"Cha'o-Ming Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cha'o-Ming Chang","id":"37438757100"},{"name":"M.

From these field distributions, resonance modes were identified that are similar to those found in a simple cylindrical cavity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/18024/00831705.pdf","startPage":"66","endPage":"71","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/15.831705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.831705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18024","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=831705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-difference time-domain analysis of the Celestron-8 telescope","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["FDTD methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomical telescopes","finite difference time-domain analysis","electromagnetic interference","frequency response","electromagnetic wave scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic scattering","finite-difference time-domain analysis","Celestron-8 telescope","computational resources","generic optical system response","microwave radiation","plane wave","Gaussian pulse excitation","point sensors","frequency response","time response","field distributions","resonance modes identification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/831705/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"Finite-difference time-domain analysis of the Celestron-8 telescope","volume":"42","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6569593","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-difference time-domain analysis of the Celestron-8 telescope","sourcePdf":"00831705.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038095S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"1","articleId":"831705","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":831711,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We discuss a family of transmission techniques which combine transmit diversity and multicode transmission for achieving high data rates. Higher system spectral efficiencies (greater than one) can potentially be achieved if the same spreading code is used on different antennas to transmit independent substreams. In this case multiple antennas at the receiver distinguish the signals based only on their spatial characteristics. In general, the receivers employ an extension of the BLAST (Bell Labs Layered Space-Time) receiver architecture for wideband CDMA signals. Accounting for shadowing and frequency-selective Rayleigh fading, we develop a novel technique for evaluating the capacity of systems with CDMA BLAST detectors and show that the resulting capacities offer significant improvement over conventional single antenna systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

The proposed problem is made analytically tractable by: (1) transforming the physical diversity branches into a \"virtual branch\" domain; and (2) using alternative definite integral representations of the conditional SEP with finite limits; which results in a simple derivation. We further obtain a canonical structure for the SEP as a weighted sum of the elementary SEPs, which are the SEPs of a non-diversity (single-branch) system with appropriate fading parameters and average SNR, whose closed-form expressions are well-known.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

We showed that a simple, arbitrarily picked, turbo coded modulation scheme using the 4-PSK constellation outperforms the space-time block and trellis codes significantly. In this paper we present further results on the use of turbo coded modulation for antenna diversity systems. In particular, we consider different constellation sizes and various spectral efficiencies. We observe very high gains over the corresponding space-time codes for large interleaver lengths, which is suitable for data communications. We also observe that, depending on the channel model, the turbo code block size can be chosen small enough to be suitable for speech applications, and still offer significant performance improvement in terms of frame error rates.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

However, its performance is limited by the existence of multiple access interference energy (MAI), which results in the so called near-far problem. To reduce the MAI effect, different multiuser detection methods have been proposed. Many of these methods require the amplitudes and relative delays of the users signals to be either a-priori known or accurately estimated. A number of algorithms that jointly perform this estimation and detection have been investigated. These algorithms, however, generally require a high computational effort. In this paper, we present a joint adaptive channel gain estimator and decorrelator, which has a significantly lower complexity. The performance of this joint adaptive structure is evaluated using simulations in multipath channels, both variant and invariant.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

In the absence of error propagation the MMSE DF perfectly cancels interference from k-1 already detected users. If the information bits are decoded at the receiver and re-encoded before being processed by a feedback filter, the number of erroneous decisions passed to other users can be decreased. This improves interference estimation, hence lowering the bit error rate (BER) and increasing the capacity. Convolutional, trellis and turbo trellis codes are employed to reduce error propagation. The performance of various coded systems is compared for the same bandwidth and maximal spectral efficiency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feedback","Convolutional codes","Modulation coding","Bit error rate","Multiaccess communication","Mean square error methods","Gaussian channels","Interference cancellation","Decoding","Information filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","feedback","radio receivers","convolutional codes","trellis codes","turbo codes","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","signal detection","code division multiple access","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MMSE decision feedback receiver","convolutional codes","trellis coded modulation","coded CDMA system","minimum mean square error","additive white Gaussian noise channel","interference cancellation","information bits decoding","feedback filter","interference estimation","bit error rate","BER","capacity","turbo trellis codes","error propagation reduction","coded systems performance","bandwidth","maximal spectral efficiency","code division multiple access","multiple access interference","base station receiver","multiuser MMSE decision feedback detector","AWGN channel"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.831733","startPage":"2405","endPage":"2410 vol.5","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

In particular, two schemes, namely, linear and exponential schemes are demonstrated. The proposed PCL avoids the tedious decision on the threshold distance, which is required for the nth-order-of-distance (nOD) PCL. The relative power consumption among different schemes is also presented to illustrate the disadvantages of the previously reported schemes. Comparison with conventional nOD PCL shows that the proposed PCL yields more balanced and better performance.

With the multipath time delays information, a minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator is then derived to estimate the channel multipath gains. It is demonstrated that the proposed channel estimation scheme can significantly improve the performance of OFDM systems and that it is also quite robust to the variations in the channel statistics.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

In order to incorporate the a-priori knowledge into the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimator, a Bayesian approach is applied to an appropriate GSM system model. The performance of the new algorithm is compared to a conventional least squares (LS) channel estimator by means of analysis and simulations. Simulations are carried out for the standard GSM channel profiles (TU50, HT100, RA250). Information about the shape of the power delay profile is assumed to be unavailable to the receiver. The merit of the new channel estimator is confirmed by yielding an MSE approximately 1-2 dB lower than the LS estimator. The lower MSE translates into a BER advantage of approximately 0.25 dB. Exploiting additional knowledge about the shape of the power delay profile results in further BER performance improvements of up to 0.3 dB.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.831756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17896","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

We introduce a suitable Markov model with a finite number of states, designed to approximate both the values and the statistical properties of the correlated flat fading channel phase, which poses a more severe challenge to PSK transmission than amplitude fading. The forward-backward algorithm is used to determine both the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) value for each bit in the data sequence, and the MAP channel phase in each iteration. Soft information is exchanged between the phase and data estimation modules. Using a turbo-code and joint iterative decoding and channel estimation, performance is demonstrated to approach an upper bound to the capacity of a Markov-phase channel.","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

Implementation of SOVA, whose advantages are its simplicity compared to the MAP algorithm and its ease of implementation, only requires minor modification from the Viterbi decoder chips. However, quantisation loss due to hardware implementation has not been thoroughly addressed previously and is discussed in this paper. Due to over-estimation of reliability values by SOVA, soft-limiting (clipping) of reliability values can provide some gain which can compensate for the loss due to quantization and, in certain cases, provide performance that is close to MAP decoding.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/831768/","conferenceDate":"5-9 Dec. 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"volume":"5","accessionNumber":"6644140","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2005","publicationDate":"1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance of turbo codes with quantized channel measurements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of turbo codes with quantized channel measurements","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"00831768.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037474S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6675","citationCount":"3","articleId":"831768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":831769,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This feature is desirable for the use of a low-cost nonlinear amplifier in a high-data-rate multiple access system, especially on the uplink of cellular systems. To allow coherent demodulation, per-symbol detection is introduced to the constant envelope modulation (CEM), which increases receiver complexity modestly compared to conventional bit-by-bit detection.

It offers better performance than most of the traditional coding schemes. Turbo coding has been considered for using in the next mobile communications standard (IMT-2000). For decoding of these codes a soft-input-soft-output (SISO) decoder is necessary. Several reduced complexity algorithms suitable for hardware implementation have been introduced. However, a comparison in terms of performance, throughput, complexity and power consumption is not available. In this paper different turbo decoder algorithms and architectures are compared in this aspects with focus on the proposed parameters of IMT-2000.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

The NBQC architecture has a better coverage performance than the current 3-sector cellular architecture. More importantly, the NBQC architecture allows easy implementation of the powerful interleaved channel assignment (ICA) scheme. Because of taking full advantage of the antenna directivity, the NBQC architecture with the ICA scheme can improve the signal to interference ratio (SIR) performance, thereby increasing the system capacity significantly. Our results show that in a typical radio environment, the NBQC system with the ICA scheme can achieve a reuse factor N=2 with the 90 percentile of SIR as high as 11 dB, which represents 3 to 5 dB SIR improvement or about at least 40 percent system capacity improvement over current cellular networks.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.831793","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

When we satisfy the highest QoS requirement, the other services will be operating at \"unnecessary high quality\". In this case, a lot of bandwidth is wasted due to a low traffic load. To solve this problem and to achieve higher spectral efficiency, a \"QoS balance\" method is developed to optimise the allocation of transmission power and evaluated in a wideband DS-CDMA environment integrated with video and voice services. Our simulation results demonstrate that the capacity of the network or spectral efficiency is improved significantly, by this optimal power allocation scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power allocation based on QoS balance for a multi-rate packet CDMA system with multimedia traffic","publicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

This linearization technique is also analyzed with respect to its effect on amplifier efficiency. To further improve efficiency and performance, the look-up tables are normalized at the operating point instead of the linear gain point. Finally, adaptive algorithms are detailed.

Multiple transmission antennas (MA) are employed for increasing the network capacity. It is assumed that partial or total knowledge of the downlink channel is available at the base-station due to either a time-division duplex (TDD) or some feedback structure in the network. Spatial and temporal dimensions can no longer be jointly exploited due to the aperiodic spreading. Hence, spatio-temporal pre-cancellation of downlink interference (zero-forcing) is no longer possible. However beamforming can be applied to maximize the signal-to-noise plus interference (SINR) ratio on a user-to-user basis. We proceed with such an approach and provide closed-form relations for the signal and interference terms at the output of a mobile station RAKE receiver. We also show that using the spatial dimension at the base station enhances the system performance. The mobile receiver can later employ on equalizer to do away with the residual intersymbol interference, thus maximizing the matched filter bound (MFB) at its output.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatio-temporal array processing for aperiodic CDMA downlink transmission","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

But the linear minimum mean squared error (MMSE) detector is in fact the Kalman filter which is a first-order recursive filter for asynchronous multiuser CDMA systems. Therefore in an adaptive implementation, the filter structure should be a first-order IIR filter. Of the host of adaptive IIR filtering algorithms, we choose to study the simplest of them, the recursive least mean square (LMS) method. Although mis-convergence has been reported for this algorithm when the system order is under-estimated, in our case this does not occur since the system order is unity at all times. Exact modelling is therefore possible, and convergence to the global minimum is seen in all our simulations using an algorithm that has a complexity linear in the number of adaptive parameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive IIR filtering for asynchronous multiuser CDMA detection","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

The BER performance difference between the minimum mean square error (MMSE) linear multiuser detector (MUD) and zero forcing (ZF) MUD increases with the eigenvalue spread of the code correlation matrix. BF with MUD performs better than MUD alone, and BF+VD is much more effective at combating MAI than MUD+VD for low to moderate SNRs. In this regime, the performance of BF+VD approaches that of BF+MUD+VD, which clearly offers the best performance for all SNRs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of a convolutionally-encoded synchronous CDMA system with adaptive beamforming and linear multiuser detection","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

We use the basic observation that the received signal is cyclostationary, and that the modulation rate is one of the cyclic frequencies. The classical estimator based on the maximization in the cyclic frequency domain of a sum of square modulus cyclic correlations sum has poor performance if the excess bandwidth used by the emitter is small. In this paper, we study in detail an estimator introduced by Dandawate and Giannakis (1994), which is based on an appropriate weighted version of the statistics used by Gardner (1988). The optimal weighting matrix depends on the unknown parameters, and has to be estimated in practice. In particular, the optimal matrix depends in general on the unknown cyclic frequencies, and is thus difficult to estimate. The main contribution of this paper is to show that, for low excess bandwidth signals, the optimal weighting matrix actually does not depend on the non zero cyclic frequencies to be estimated. It can be thus consistently estimated from the cyclic statistics of the observation at cyclic frequency 0. We evaluate the performance of the weighted approach, and show that it provide considerable improvement over the traditional estimator.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.831861","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

Our adaptive algorithms do not require channel order estimation, nor rank estimation. Compared with other second order statistics based approaches, ours do not require channel identification at all. On the other hand, compared with the CMA type algorithms, ours use only second order statistics, thus no local convergence problem exists and faster convergence can be achieved. Simulations show that our algorithms outperform most typical existing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.831864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17893","startPage":"1022","endPage":"1026 vol.2","pdfPath":"/iel5/6676/17893/00831864.pdf","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

However these methods apply only to systems with unused channels or require the sacrifice of data rate for PAR reduction. We present a new method for PAR reduction using active (data-carrying) channels which dynamically moves outer constellation points, within margin-preserving constraints, to minimize the peak magnitude. This scheme simultaneously decreases the bit error rate slightly while substantially reducing the peak magnitude; simulations show peak reductions of slightly more than 6 dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

This paper presents a joint channel estimation and decoding scheme for frequency-flat, time-selective Rayleigh fading with relatively high Doppler, that does not require external phase information or even pilot symbols. This system outperforms a pilot-aided iterative channel estimation algorithm that does not decode and estimate jointly. The joint decoding algorithm models the phase trajectory of the channel as a suitable Markov process, the dynamics of which depend on the Doppler rate. At each iteration it considers all possible phase trajectories to determine the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) value for each bit. This decoding procedure is a natural extension of standard turbo decoding, but introduces a significant complexity increase. Performance is assessed via an upper bound to the capacity of a Markov-phase channel.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.831883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17893","startPage":"1122","endPage":"1126 vol.2","pdfPath":"/iel5/6676/17893/00831883.pdf","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

Low-order autoregressive models approximate the channel taps, where each tap is a circular complex Gaussian random process with the typical U-shaped spectrum, and uncorrelated with each other. A Kalman filter tracks the time-varying channel, using the decisions of an adaptive minimum-mean-squared-error decision-feedback equalizer (DFE). The DFE is optimized for decision delay /spl Delta/>0, which exhibits performance advantages over decision delay /spl Delta/=0 for a wide range of channels. The DFE staggered decisions cause the Kalman filter to also track the channel with a delay. The receiver also uses a channel prediction module to bridge the time gap between the Kalman channel estimation and the channel estimates needed for the DFE adaptation. The proposed algorithm offers good tracking behavior thus allowing for reduction in the amount of training symbols needed to effectively track a time-varying frequency selective channel.","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

While in general it may not be efficient to use an oversampled representation for applications like compression, our work investigates efficient techniques for representing the oversampled data, given that after oversampling there exists substantial redundancy. We discuss different strategies which take advantage of this oversampling by establishing some consistency constraints on the representation that reduce uncertainty in the quantization. This results in a coding gain as we increase the oversampling in the steerable transform (number of orientations). Thus, while in general it will not be possible to achieve as good compression performance as with a critically sampled transform, having a compressed steerable representation will be useful for applications where a feature is needed (many significant image features can be extracted from an orientation analysis), and where for performance reasons it is preferable not to have to decompress and analyze each image (as may be necessary if standard non-steerable transforms are used for compression).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Image analysis","Wavelet transforms","Nonlinear filters","Uncertainty","Feature extraction","Image sampling","Quantization","Signal representations","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image representation","redundancy","transform coding","image sampling","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coding techniques","oversampled steerable transforms","signal representation","compression","redundancy","consistency constraints","quantization","orientations","compression performance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.831897","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

For several applications, a significant reduction in area, delay, and power consumption is achieved by performing squaring using specialized squarers, instead of multipliers. Although most previous research on parallel squarers focuses on the design of unsigned squarers, squaring of two's complement numbers is also often required. This paper presents the design of parallel squarers that perform either unsigned or two's complement squaring, based on an input control signal. Compared to unsigned parallel squarers, these squarers require only a small amount of additional delay and area.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Symmetric matrices","Application software","Energy consumption","Signal design","Wires","Computer architecture","Digital arithmetic","Laboratories","Added delay","Digital signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","digital arithmetic","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined unsigned and two's complement squarers","digital signal processing","area","delay","power consumption","parallel squarers","two's complement numbers","input control signal"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.831900","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

The new converters presented in this paper are hardware-efficient since all the modulo adders required by them are adders mod(2/sup n/-1) which can easily be implemented as 1's complement adders.

This paper presents a novel algorithm and architecture for the rotation-mode in circular and hyperbolic coordinate systems in which the directions of all micro-rotations are pre-computed while maintaining a constant scale factor. Thus, an examination of the sign of the angle after each iteration is no longer required. By using a redundant adder, the critical path (without scaling and conversion) of the entire CORDIC architecture only requires (1.5n+2) full-adders (n corresponds to the word-length of the inputs) for rotation mode. This is a speed improvement of about 20% compared to the previously fastest reported rotation mode implementations. Additionally, there is a higher degree of freedom in choosing the pipeline cutsets due to the novel feature of independence of the iterations i and i-1 in the CORDIC rotation. Optional pipelining can lead for example in the rotation mode to an on-line delay of three clock cycles including scaling and conversion, where every clock cycle corresponds to a delay of twelve full-adders.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Iterative algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Vectors","Computer architecture","Pipeline processing","Clocks","Application software","Signal processing","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","signal processing","iterative methods","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CORDIC rotation method","generalized coordinate systems","coordinate rotation digital computer","iterative algorithm","two-dimensional vector rotation","linear coordinate system","circular coordinate system","hyperbolic coordinate system","add and shift operations","architecture","micro-rotations","constant scale factor","redundant adder","full-adders","input word-length","speed improvement","rotation mode implementation","pipeline cutsets","on-line delay","clock cycles","scaling","conversion","delay"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=831929","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.831929","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

CORDIC based SVD algorithms are among the most popular SVD algorithms which exhibit good numerical properties. The speed of the sequential algorithms is however limited by the recursive feedback loops in the underlying signal flow graph. The critical loop computation time is proportional to the size of the problem which prohibits pipelined processing. This paper addresses the derivation of parallel architectures for SVD updating algorithms. An algorithm transformation approach based on re-timing and matrix associativity is presented to drive parallel SVD updating architectures. These architectures have critical loop computation time independent of the problem size and are suitable for CORDIC arithmetic based VLSI implementations.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.831936","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

Shekarforoush et al. (1994) investigated an algorithm that works well for when observed data are samples of ideally bandlimited images. In fact, images of real scenes captured by modern optics are not ideally bandlimited images. This paper examines how aliasing in sampled images effects the ideal phase relationships between continuous images undergoing translational shifts. We show that the performance of standard phase correlation methods for subpixel image registration can be severely degraded with moderate amounts of aliasing, and we investigate two approaches for modeling aliasing effects in order to improve subpixel image registration accuracy. The first approach, a very simple algorithm, both conceptually and computationally is based on detecting those frequency components that have become unreliable estimators of shift due to aliasing, and removing the detected components from the shift estimate. The second approach, more ambitious and more complex, attempts to undo the effects of aliasing and to use all de-aliased frequency components in the shift estimator.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.831945","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

Of these operations, multiply is the biggest concern as multiplying two n-bit data yields a 2n-bit product. Forming the full product and rounding it to the desired precision is mathematically attractive, but the complexity is high. Forming a portion of the bit product matrix would reduce the complexity, but this incurs potentially large errors. A compromise approach has been developed that represents a reasonable (in many applications) compromise. The complexity is slightly above that of a truncated bit product multiplier, but the accuracy is close to that of a rounded full precision multiplier.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.831996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1999.831996","startPage":"1480","endPage":"1483 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

In the forward link, all users are broadcasted synchronously and the multi-user access interference (MAI) traverses the same channel as the desired user. Thus, effecting ZF equalisation (with two antennas) for the desired user also also effects ZF equalization for the MAI. Assuming the use of orthogonal variable spreading factor (OSVF) codes on transmit, one may correlate with the desired user's code at the output of the ZF equalizer and ideally have zero MAI in the symbol decision statistics obtained by sampling once per symbol after synchronization. Simulations are presented demonstrating the advantages of the proposed two-channel ZF equalizer, followed by a conventional correlator with symbol rate sampling, over a RAKE receiver.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-channel zero forcing equalization on CDMA forward link: trade-offs between multi-user access interference and diversity gains","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

We compare the structure and performance of different space-time RAKE receivers for WCDMA. After a review of the decoupled space-time RAKE and the joint space-time RAKE, we present a new joint space-time RAKE with spatial and temporal compression matrices. Here, the spatial compression matrix is calculated from spatial covariance matrices that can be averaged over several time slots, since the change of the spatial characteristics is much slower than the fast fading. It has more degrees of freedom than the decoupled space-time RAKE, but less than the joint space-time RAKE. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate the performance of several space-time RAKE structures for different scenarios. It turns out that if good spatio-temporal channel estimates are available (e.g., in case of a small Doppler), more degrees of freedom can be exploited by the space-lime RAKE receiver structure.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On space-time RAKE receiver structures for WCDMA","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

A new blind interference cancellation technique, based on the subspace projection approach, suitable for the downlink of any CDMA system is proposed. The receiver is blind in the sense that no prior knowledge of users' spreading codes or even their spreading factors are required. The mobile receiver estimates the effective spreading codes of the interfering users regardless of their spreading factors using fast Walsh transform correlators and uses these information to cancel out the intra-cell multi-user interference. The complexity of the proposed technique is low compared to conventional interference cancellation techniques. Simulation results show a capacity increase of up to 150 % of the original (without IIC) system capacity or up to 12 dB signal to Gaussian noise ratio gain at a fixed capacity (the inter-cell interference is modeled as Gaussian noise).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A subspace projection based blind interference cancellation scheme for W-CDMA downlink","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

A chirp signal is used as a training sequence to estimate the impulse response of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The additive white noise in the channel decreases the performance of the estimation. Since the chirp signal is localized but the noise is spread in the joint time-frequency plane, the output of the LTI system can be denoised by using time-frequency techniques.

Information is generated in certain nodes and needs to reach a set of designated gateway nodes. Each node may adjust its power within a certain range that determines the set of possible one hop away neighbors. Traffic forwarding through multiple hops is employed when the intended destination is not within immediate reach. The nodes have limited initial amounts of energy that is consumed at different rates depending on the power level and the intended receiver. We propose algorithms to select the routes and the corresponding power levels such that the time until the batteries of the nodes drain-out is maximized. The algorithms are local and amenable to distributed implementation. When there is a single power level, the problem is reduced to a maximum flow problem with node capacities and the algorithms converge to the optimal solution. When there are multiple power levels then the achievable lifetime is close to the optimal (that is computed by linear programming) most of the time. It turns out that in order to maximize the lifetime, the traffic should be routed such that the energy consumption is balanced among the nodes in proportion to their energy reserves, instead of routing to minimize the absolute consumed power.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000.

The clusterheads form a d-hop dominating set. Each node is at most d hops from a clusterhead. Clusterheads form a virtual backbone and may be used to route packets for nodes in their cluster. Previous heuristics restricted themselves to 1-hop clusters. We show that the minimum d-hop dominating set problem is NP-complete. Then we present a heuristic to form d-clusters in a wireless ad hoc network. Nodes are assumed to have a non-deterministic mobility pattern. Clusters are formed by diffusing node identities along the wireless links. When the heuristic terminates, a node either becomes a clusterhead, or is at most d wireless hops away from its clusterhead. The value of d is a parameter of the heuristic. The heuristic can be run either at regular intervals, or whenever the network configuration changes. One of the features of the heuristic is that it tends to re-elect existing clusterheads even when the network configuration changes. This helps to reduce the communication overheads during transition from old clusterheads to new clusterheads. Also, there is a tendency to evenly distribute the mobile nodes among the clusterheads, and evently distribute the responsibility of acting as clusterheads among all nodes. Thus, the heuristic is fair and stable. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed heuristic is better than the two earlier heuristics, namely the LCA and degree-based solutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6551962","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2000","isConference":true,"volume":"1","displayDocTitle":"Max-min d-cluster formation in wireless ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Max-min d-cluster formation in wireless ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00832171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034655S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"17985","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6725","citationCount":"436","articleId":"832171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":832173,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Under this assumption, we present a detailed analysis of the tail behaviour of the workload distribution at each queue. If the guaranteed unit speed of server 1 is already sufficient to handle its offered traffic, then the workload distribution at the first queue is shown to be regularly varying at infinity of index 1-v/sub 1/. But if it is not sufficient, then the workload distribution at the first queue is shown to be regularly varying at infinity of index 1-min(v/sub 1/,v/sub 2/).

Many distributed systems and applications can benefit from such a distance map service, for example, a common method to improve user-perceived performance of the Internet is to place data and server mirrors closer to clients. When a client tries to access a mirrored server, which mirror should it access? With IDMaps, the closest mirror can be determined based on distance estimates between the client and the mirrors. In this paper we investigate both graph theoretic methods and ad hoc heuristics for instrumenting the Internet to obtain distance maps. We evaluate the efficacy of the resulting distance maps by comparing the determinations of the closest replica using known topologies against those obtained using the distance maps.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17985","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832199","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000.

And many of them need a great number of satellites to provide broadband services with limited frequencies, and each satellite may have a number of direct intersatellite links (ISL) that are mutually visible satellites. But, in case when long-distance-dependent (LDD) traffic dominate, performance in terms of the overall network decrease, because of traffic transfer via many ISL on the routing path. To solve these problems, we propose a new topological design and routing protocol for broadband satellite communication networks. The former is called the satellite-over-satellite (SOS) network which has a multiple layered satellite constellation, and the latter is called the hierarchical QoS routing protocol (HQRP) supporting a simple routing protocol for LDD multimedia traffic.

The network consists of K base stations and M wireless data users. The data streams generated by the users are treated as best-effort traffic, in the sense that there are no pre-specified constraints on the quality of the radio channels. We are interested in designing a distributed algorithm that achieves maximal (or near-maximal in some reasonable sense) aggregate throughput, subject to peak power constraints. We provide an algorithm where base stations coordinate in a distributed fashion to control the powers and spreading gains of the users, and show that it converges to a Nash equilibrium point. In general, there may be multiple equilibrium points; however, certain structural properties of the throughput expression can be exploited to significantly trim the search space and induce an ordering on the users in each cell. The numerical results indicate that with these modifications, the algorithm frequently converges in just a few iterations to the throughput maximizing (globally optimal) power and spreading gain allocation.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832210","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000.

The analysis of the models under simple, yet natural, assumptions yields certain ubiquitous structural properties of 'optimal' power control algorithms.

We present two centralized algorithms for use in static networks, and prove their optimality. For mobile networks, we present two distributed heuristics that adaptively adjust node transmit powers in response to topological changes and attempt to maintain a connected topology using minimum power.

Traffic flow is routed along shortest paths, splitting flow at nodes where several outgoing links are on shortest paths to the destination. The weights of the links, and thereby the shortest path routes, can be changed by the network operator. The weights could be set proportional to their physical distances, but often the main goal is to avoid congestion, i.e., overloading of links, and the standard heuristic recommended by Cisco is to make the weight of a link inversely proportional to its capacity. Our starting point was a proposed AT&T WorldNet backbone with demands projected from previous measurements. The desire was to optimize the weight setting based on the projected demands. We showed that optimizing the weight settings for a given set of demands is NP-hard, so we resorted to a local search heuristic. Surprisingly it turned out that for the proposed AT&T WorldNet backbone, we found weight settings that performed within a few percent from that of the optimal general routing where the flow for each demand is optimally distributed over all paths between source and destination. This contrasts the common belief that OSPF routing leads to congestion and it shows that for the network and demand matrix studied we cannot get a substantially better load balancing by switching to the proposed more flexible multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) technologies. Our techniques were also tested on synthetic internetworks, based on a model of Zegura et al., (1996), for which we did not always get quite as close to the optimal general routing.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000.

Cooperative caching systems are more effective than independent caches due to the larger collective backing store that cooperation creates. One such system currently being developed at UCLA, adaptive Web caching (AWC), uses an application-level forwarding table to locate the nearest copy of a requested URL's contents. This paper describes one specific design in AWC, a simple URL table compression algorithm allowing efficient content information-sharing among neighboring caches. The compression algorithm is based on a hierarchical URL decomposition to aggregate URL sharing common prefixes and an incremental hashing function to minimize collisions between prefixes. The algorithm's collision rate is derived analytically and verified by five sets of Web trace data. The results demonstrate that the collision rate is bounded and has little impact on page fetching latency. Finally, this compression method is compared to the summary cache method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832241/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","publicationDate":"2000","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6567144","isConference":true,"volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"URL forwarding and compression in adaptive Web caching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"URL forwarding and compression in adaptive Web caching","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00832241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029371S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6725","citationCount":"22","articleId":"832241","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":832249,"authors":[{"name":"Kang-Won Lee","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"lastName":"Kang-Won Lee","id":"37067038600"},{"name":"R.

The proposed video coding scheme operates on a progressively encoded video stream and provides graceful resilience to network packet drops. The robustness is enabled through a generalized multiple description (MD) coding strategy, architectured as an adaptive array of packet-erasure correction codes. The video coding algorithm is matched to an efficient and reactive rate control mechanism that minimizes the fluctuation of rate and uses the profile of past losses to adjust the rate in a TCP-friendly manner. While the two constituent algorithms identified above are interesting in their own right, a key feature of this work is the integration of these algorithms in a simple framework that seeks to maximize the expected delivered video quality at the receiver through coordinated adaptation of the two components.

In WDM-based packet networks, routers are connected to each other using wavelengths (lightpaths) to form a logical network topology. This logical topology may be reconfigured by rearranging the lightpaths connecting the routers. The goal of our load balancing algorithms is to minimize network delay by reconfiguring the logical topology. Since delay becomes unbounded as the load approaches the link capacity, delay is usually dominated by the most heavily loaded link. Therefore, our algorithms attempt to minimize the maximum link load. Even when traffic is static, deriving the optimal logical topology for a given traffic pattern is known to be NP-complete. Previous work on reconfiguration proposed heuristic algorithms to determine the \"best\" logical topology for the given traffic pattern and migrated to that topology using a series of reconfiguration steps. However, when traffic patterns are changing rapidly, reconfiguring the full network with every change in the traffic may be extremely disruptive. In this paper, we develop iterative reconfiguration algorithms for load balancing that track rapid changes in the traffic pattern. At each reconfiguration step, our algorithms make only a small change to the network topology, hence, minimizing the disruption to the network. We study the performance of our algorithms under several dynamic traffic scenarios and show that our algorithms perform near optimally.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832276","startPage":"1010","endPage":"1019 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000.

The mobile handset is assumed to have two antennas, either spatially separated or having diverse polarizations. Blind channel identification via the cross-relation method (CRM) of Xu, Liu, Tong, and Kailath (1995) is possible when there is a common input into at least two distinct channels (not having common spectral nulls.) The common input in the forward link is the superposition of all active users: desired user plus multi-user access interference (MAI). Although each user's signal is typically below the noise floor prior to cross-correlating with it's respective code, the power of the sum signal is above the noise floor-well above the noise floor in the case of many active users which is the goal of third generation cellular systems. We present simulations assessing the quality of the channel estimates for two types of equalizers: a zero-forcing equalizer and a RAKE receiver.

To address this problem, we establish a new signal processing framework called \"closed-loop multistage adaptive beamforming.\" A simplistic environmental model is used to demonstrate the capabilities of this new class of signal processing architectures. In typical applications, closed-loop multistage adaptive beamforming is shown to potentially result in one of the following desirable results: (1) orders of magnitude reductions in hardware and processing complexity for a given performance level; and (2) orders of magnitude improvements in interference rejection and target detection for a given number of instantaneously adaptive degrees of freedom.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832303/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"6604306","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Closed-loop multistage adaptive beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-loop multistage adaptive beamforming","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00832303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037695S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"18015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6676","citationCount":"3","articleId":"832303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":832304,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.

The first step in such a synchronization process is to determine the location of a periodically occurring marker (say N bits long, where N may be as large as 256) transmitted by all transmitters (base stations) in the system. This has to be done using a sliding window correlator matched to the marker pattern. Since the marker is a +1/-1 sequence, the matched filter operation involves additions and sign flip operations, but no multiplications. However, since the chip rates in typical CDMA systems are several MHz, the correlation operation consumes several giga adds per second. A straightforward implementation of this device (an N tap delay line with N adders) would be inefficient both in terms of area as well as power. We investigate a simple architecture that involves breaking the correlator into multiple partial correlations, storing the partial correlations in SRAM, and accumulating the partial results at each step. The size of the partial correlations is a parameter of the architecture; we investigate various values for this parameter and show how the estimated power of the circuit varies with the parameter. We compare our approach with other digital as well as analog approaches that have been used for such a matched filter. Finally, we discuss correlator architectures for efficiently exploiting any structure that may be present within the marker sequence.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.832308","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

On the Sun UltraSPARC-II processor, we find speedups of 2.4 for hand loop unrolling, 1.46 for the visual instruction set over floating-point arithmetic in C, and 1.33 for software prefetching.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6608900","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 1999","displayDocTitle":"Real-time high-throughput sonar beamforming kernels using native signal processing and memory latency hiding techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time high-throughput sonar beamforming kernels using native signal processing and memory latency hiding techniques","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00832310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055731S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"18015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6676","citationCount":"3","articleId":"832310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":832312,"authors":[{"name":"C.N.

In this work, optimal quantization of pulse amplitude-modulated systems is analyzed and applied to a cdma2000 reverse link transmitter. Of particular interest is how reverse link channels are scaled prior to subsequent quantization as a result of digital-to-analog conversion.

However, for a sufficiently large user population, it can be shown that the stochastic MMSE receiver system has a high probability in any given neighborhood of a single operating point, which can be shown to be a globally stable equilibrium point of an associated deterministic system. In addition, adaptive versions of the MMSE receiver based on least-mean squares and recursive least squares are considered.

The proposed scheme suppresses multiuser interference over a wide range of user signal powers, by iteratively exchanging soft information between a minimum mean square error (MMSE) multiuser demodulator and a bank of single-user decoders, feeding back the outputs of the latter to aid in soft multiuser multisensor MMSE-RAKE demodulation and subtractive interference cancellation. It displays remarkable near-far resistance, since it functions like a successive interference subtracter across iterations. The array responses are also obtained using soft-decoded feedback estimates and (temporal) pilot symbols, seeking neither to rely on the array geometry nor to estimate the directions from which users' signals arrive at the receiver. Simulation studies indicate that this scheme performs remarkably close to the single-user case with a two-sensor receiver array, and perfect channel state information, after four iterations; alternatively, it allows significant overload capability compared with conventional receivers, and suffers only a modest loss with estimated array responses.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative MMSE multiuser interference suppression for coded dispersive CDMA wireless channels with multisensor receivers","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

A least mean square (LMS) based adaptation of this receiver is presented. The quadratic cost-function viz. the output variance is quadratic in coefficients of the interference canceling filter leading to global convergence. On the other hand, the channel coefficients are separately optimized based upon the interference canceler. We explore decision directed strategies to improve the performance of the overall receiver.

Systems incorporating broadcast components include such diverse technologies as wireless communications systems, web servers, distributed computing devices, and video conferencing systems. Currently, the compression algorithms (or source codes) employed in these devices fail to take advantage of the characteristics specific to broadcast systems. Instead, they treat a single node transmitting information to a collection of receivers as a collection of single-transmitter single-receiver communications problems and employ an independent source code on each. This approach is convenient, since it allows direct application of traditional compression techniques in a wide variety of broadcast system applications. Nonetheless, we here argue that the approach is inherently flawed. Our innovation in this paper is to treat the general broadcast system (with an arbitrary number of receivers and both specific and common information) as an inseparable whole and consider the resulting source coding ramifications. The result is a new paradigm for data compression on general broadcast systems. In this work, we describe this broadcast system source coding paradigm and examine the potential gains achievable by moving away from more conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.832348","startPage":"337","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

In contrast to the popular signal processing based methods, we propose channel coding principles to correlate the descriptions, and then use this correlation for combating channel impairments. We propose a fast, nearly optimal algorithm that aims to maximize the expected quality at the receiver given the channel state and the side channel rates. Our scheme can be used in conjunction with any source coder that is scalable, and is most easily matched to coders outputting a progressive bitstream. It has applications to the transmission of audio, images, as well as delay-constrained video signals, and can also be used to achieve reliable multicast transmission over the existing Internet with the use of simple protocols. Comparisons of our scheme on standard test images to some of the existing state-of-the-art signal processing based MD methods suggest that our simple scheme outperforms them by significant margins.","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

By proper choice of angular regions and desired beampatterns in each region, we can trade off the level of pattern control with algorithmic complexity.

These receivers are discussed in the context of CDMA applications. A maximum likelihood formulation of multiuser detection with antenna arrays is introduced to provide motivation and intuition. The proposed multiuser receiver incorporates space-time beamforming and time-domain interference cancellation.

A system with n transmit and m (n/spl ges/m) receiver antennas is assumed. An adaptive MIMO linear equalizer has been considered. For the considered equalizer a least squares solution is formulated, based on which a recursive solution using Riccati recursions is proposed. The solutions are tested by simulating the MIMO system. It is shown that the adaptive solutions will achieve the same performance as the optimum least squares solutions. The effect of the nondiagonal channel elements (acting as interference) on the system performance is also studied. It has been shown that in order to achieve better performance, the interference from nondiagonal channel elements needs to be minimized. This can be done by using orthogonal transmission. Moreover the proposed solutions do not require channel identification and will also enable equalizer adaptation to channel changes.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.832390","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

The suite consists of a set of JHDL circuit libraries, simulator, schematic generator, hardware debugger and other tools that can be used to design, develop and debug designs. JHDL is a unique design tool that unifies simulation and hardware execution into a single environment. Designers can easily select either simulation or execution and all of the circuit verification and visualization tools are fully usable whether in simulation or hardware execution mode. Because of its unified simulation/execution design environment, JHDL is the first tool that directly supports symbolic debugging of a user design in the original design context while the design is actually executing in FPGA hardware. JHDL allows designers to exploit the immediate availability of FPGA hardware making it possible to test and symbolically debug designs at hardware speeds that run several orders of magnitude faster than simulation. JHDL also supports end-to-end application development of the user circuitry including any control code and any user interface software including graphical user interfaces (GUIs). User circuitry is designed using JHDL libraries while control software and user interface software is written using standard Java libraries such as Swing, for example. This paper gives an overview of the JHDL tool suite and presents a tutorial on JHDL syntax.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Debugging","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Circuit simulation","Java","User interfaces","Software libraries","Visualization","Context modeling","Circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software tools","computer debugging","field programmable gate arrays","circuit simulation","Java","graphical user interfaces","software libraries","logic CAD","hardware description languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA applications","application development","simulator","Java-based design tools","Brigham Young University","JHDL circuit libraries","schematic generator","hardware debugger","simulation","hardware execution","circuit verification tools","circuit visualization tools","simulation/execution design environment","symbolic debugging","user circuitry","control code","user interface software","graphical user interfaces","GUI","control software","Swing","JHDL syntax","JHDL CAD suite"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=832391","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.832391","startPage":"554","endPage":"558 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

Higher performance systems using custom silicon cost too much for the typically small production volumes, and are not flexible enough for research applications. Field programmable gate arrays offer the performance of custom silicon while maintaining the economies and flexibility of the microprocessor based solutions. Recent devices possess the density and performance to realize a complete radar signal processor in a single FPGA, including complex down-conversion of the IF to base-band. Performing the down-conversion and matched filtering in the FPGA eliminates the specialty chips previously needed for these functions, making it possible to use commercially available FPGA boards. Our system packs 4 channels into a pair of FPGAs. Each channel (a demodulator, a matched filter and a Doppler pulse pair processor) executes over 5 billion multiplies per second.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832392/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6615235","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 1999","isConference":true,"volume":"1","displayDocTitle":"FPGAs make a radar signal processor on a chip a reality","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGAs make a radar signal processor on a chip a reality","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00832392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03669S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct. 1999","isNumber":"18015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6676","citationCount":"21","articleId":"832392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":832395,"authors":[{"name":"Guanbin Xing","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Guanbin Xing","id":"37271505300"},{"name":"Hui Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Hui Liu","id":"37279498800"},{"name":"R.

The architectures chosen for implementation are the distributed arithmetic (DA) architecture (with digit sizes 1 and 3), digit-serial flow graph (DSFG) architectures (with digit sizes 2, 3 and 6) and systolic architecture. The experiments show that the DA is the best architecture in terms of area, speed and latency while the systolic architecture is the worst. The 3-bit serial DA architecture has 85% better area*delay product, 24% lower clock energy per computation and 90% less latency as compared to the systolic design and it provides a HDTV throughput of 111 MPix/sec. The performance of the DSFG designs vary with digit-size. The 2-bit and 3-bit DSFG architectures have a poorer performance as compared to the DA architectures in that throughput range. However 6-bit DSFG comes quite close to 3-bit DA architecture. It has 83% better area*delay product, 13% lower clock energy per computation and 80% less latency as compared to the systolic architecture and provides a throughput of 163 MPix/sec. Another interesting observation is the dominance of route delays which form approximately 50% of the critical path delays.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance trade-off of DCT architectures in Xilinx FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.832396","startPage":"579","endPage":"583 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1999.832396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18015","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

This implementation is intended for real-time image processing and compression. The proposed approach uses a cascade combination of two 1D wavelet transforms along with a set of in-chip memory buffers, between the two stages. The required memory buffer for holding intermediate results is optimized by proper pipelining of the data transfer between the two stages. Implementation of this architecture is suitable for new Xilinx Virtex FPGAs that offer enough memory on the chip for storage of intermediate results. In this case, there is no need for external RAM modules and the complete 2D transform can be implemented on a single chip. One major advantage of this methodology is the flexibility that is offered to the user in terms of freedom for selection of the wavelet filter and tree-structure.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Wavelet transforms","Filters","Discrete wavelet transforms","Image coding","Read-write memory","Random access memory","Logic","Image processing","Discrete transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image coding","data compression","real-time systems","digital signal processing chips","discrete wavelet transforms","buffer storage","digital filters","modules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D wavelet transform","FPGA implementation","real-time image compression","real-time image processing","1D wavelet transforms","in-chip memory buffers","data transfer pipelining","architecture implementation","Xilinx Virtex FPGA","intermediate results storage","wavelet filter","wavelet tree-structure","discrete wavelet transform","DWT"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=832397","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.832397","startPage":"584","endPage":"588 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

The algorithm assumes transmit diversity, i.e. each user is equipped with at least two transmit antennas. Through each antenna the same symbol sequence is transmitted but coded in a different way. This coding does not require any extra bandwidth or power and allows one to remove multiple access interference (MAI) in a non-iterative way. The algorithm is applicable for any modulation format and forms an extension of the algorithm of Vandaele, Lens and Moonen (see Proceedings of the 2nd IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC), Annapolis, MD, USA, p.98-101, 1999) which is only applicable for BPSK modulation.

While such simple STS schemes are simpler to implement (especially in terms of error-correction coding) than the BLAST (Bell-labs LAyered Space-Time) architecture, it is of interest to quantity the expected penalties paid in terms of spectral efficiency. We derive capacity expressions for such STS systems and compare them to the corresponding expressions of related BLAST systems. Interestingly enough, it turns out that for small numbers of antennas, the deviations in performance are not so high. These results suggest that, when small numbers of antennas are available, space-time spreading is a viable option that provides a good tradeoff between ease of implementation and increased spectral efficiency of direct-spreading CDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1999.832407","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

Near floating point precision is supplied by block floating point arithmetic combined with a 20-bit internal data path. Optimized building block DSP functions, including FFT, IFFT, FIR filters, IIR filters and matrix operations, are microcoded in ROM and are supplied with the FILU-200. The small silicon area of the FILU-200, 30 K gates, enables its adoption in cost sensitive applications. Typical applications include soft modems, G.Lite, DAB, VoIP and audio.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FILU-200 DSP coprocessor IP core","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Thirty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers (Cat.

The unique code assignment procedure allows a direct mapping of the packet fair schedule to the physical layer transmission/reception, and supports transmission (service) rates of arbitrarily fine resolution.

To accomplish this, we develop a cell-wise model in which user's resource consumption is characterized, and the constraint between system bandwidth and resource consumptions of users is given. This model incorporates important factors that affect user's quality of service, including the aggregation of user traffic, user the power constraint, path loss and interference. Based on this model, we develop an admission control procedure. We further study transmission schemes using one and two channels.

A fundamental difference between wired and wireless links is that wireless media can exhibit substantial rates of link errors, resulting in significant and unpredictable loss of link capacity. This capacity loss results in a special challenge for wireless schedulers. For example, a weighted fair queue (WFQ) scheduler assumes an error free link and specifies how flows should share the link capacity. However, this specification is not sufficient to determine the correct outcome when link capacity is sharply reduced, because flows that have been allocated the same weights may differ greatly in their ability to tolerate throughput loss. In this paper, we first describe the wireless scheduling challenge in terms of an effort-outcome disconnection. Next we propose a novel notion of fairness for wireless links, effort-limited fairness (ELF), which extends WFQ via dynamic weight adjustments. ELF guarantees that all flows experiencing an error rate below a per flow threshold receive their expected service, defined as a specified rate for reserved flows or a specified share of best-effort capacity for best effort flows. After motivating and defining ELF, we present a practical approximation algorithm, which we evaluate through both trace-driven simulation and measurement of a prototype wireless radio network based on the WaveLAN physical layer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Mar 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6559165","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2000","displayDocTitle":"Effort-limited fair (ELF) scheduling for wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effort-limited fair (ELF) scheduling for wireless networks","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00832465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036697S","chronDate":"26-30 Mar 2000","isNumber":"17999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6725","citationCount":"44","articleId":"832465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":832484,"authors":[{"name":"W.

In one typical trace, for example, the top 9% of flows between ASes accounts for 86.7% of the packets and 90.7% of the bytes transmitted. A highly nonuniform traffic pattern suggests that routers need to maintain only limited QoS flow state.

We demonstrate that when users update their parameters by solving their own optimization problem, at an equilibrium the system optimum is achieved. Furthermore, this algorithm does not require any explicit feedback from the network and can be deployed over the Internet with modifications only on the end hosts. In the second part of the paper we model as a noncooperative game the case where the choice of each user's action has nonnegligible effect on the price per unit flow at the resources and investigate the Nash equilibria of the game. We show, in the simple case of a single bottleneck, that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium of the game. Further, as the number of users increases, the unique Nash equilibrium approaches the system optimum.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832485/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Mar 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6559172","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2000","displayDocTitle":"Charge-sensitive TCP and rate control in the Internet","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Charge-sensitive TCP and rate control in the Internet","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00832485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029869S","chronDate":"26-30 Mar 2000","isNumber":"17999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6725","citationCount":"64","articleId":"832485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":832493,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Packet classification is essential to routers supporting services such as quality of service (QoS), virtual private networks (VPNs), and firewalls. A filter conflict occurs when two or more filters overlap, creating an ambiguity in packet classification. Current techniques for resolving filter conflicts are based on prioritizing conflicting filters, and choosing the higher priority filter. We show that such ordering does not always work. Instead, we propose a new scheme for conflict resolution, which is based on the idea of adding resolve filters. Our main results are algorithms for detecting and resolving conflicts in a filter database. We have tried our algorithm on 3 existing firewall databases, and have found conflicts, which are potential security holes, in each of them.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information filtering","Information filters","Quality of service","Web and internet services","Matched filters","Virtual private networks","Databases","TCPIP","Protocols","Data security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet switching","telecommunication network routing","database management systems","telecommunication security","Internet","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet filter conflicts","packet classification","header fields","routers","quality of service","QoS","virtual private networks","VPN","firewalls","conflicting filters","conflict resolution","resolve filters","filter database","firewall databases","security holes","Internet"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832496","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000.

Specifically, we propose and study a novel approach to packet classification which combines a heuristic tree search with the use of filter buckets. Besides high performance and a reasonable storage requirement, our algorithm is unique in the sense that it can adapt to the input packet distribution by taking into account the relative filter usage. To evaluate our algorithms, we have developed realistic models of large scale filter tables, and used them to drive extensive experimentation. The results demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms for up to even 1 million filters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Mar 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6559177","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2000","isConference":true,"volume":"3","displayDocTitle":"A modular approach to packet classification: algorithms and results","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modular approach to packet classification: algorithms and results","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00832499.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025593S","chronDate":"26-30 Mar 2000","isNumber":"17999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6725","citationCount":"119","articleId":"832499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":832520,"authors":[{"name":"G.D.

The objective of this agent is to select the best of the service combinations offered by multiple service retailers, taking into account both user preferences as encoded in the user profile and the corresponding charges given by the retailers. The agent analyzed is based on a simple yet informative model for on-line calculation of the utility of the user for the various service combinations, and on an algorithm for fast and efficient negotiation, which is not based on any assumptions regarding the structure of retailer tariffs. We assess our approach both analytically and experimentally, and we argue that the negotiation algorithm is either optimal or close to this for a variety of interesting cases. Although our approach is illustrated by dealing with a particular news-on-demand service, it is broadly applicable. We also argue that it pertains to both Internet and ATM network technologies.","doi":"10.1109/GLOCOM.1999.832520","displayPublicationTitle":"Seamless Interconnection for Universal Services.

The virtual backbone comprises nodes that are dynamically selected to contain databases that store the location information of the network nodes. Together with the UQS and RDG schemes, the virtual backbone allows both dynamic database residence and dynamic database access, which provide high degree of location data availability and reliability. We introduce a distributed database coverage heuristic (DDCH), which is equivalent to the centralized greedy algorithm for virtual backbone generation, but only requires local information exchange and local computation. We show how DDCH can be employed to dynamically maintain the structure of the virtual backbone, along with database merging, as the network topology changes. We also provide a means to maintain connectivity among the virtual backbone nodes. We discuss optimization issues of DDCH through simulations. Simulation results suggest that the cost of ad hoc mobility management with a virtual backbone can be far below that of the conventional link-state routing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832522/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Mar 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6559185","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2000","displayDocTitle":"Virtual backbone generation and maintenance in ad hoc network mobility management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual backbone generation and maintenance in ad hoc network mobility management","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00832522.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029737S","chronDate":"26-30 Mar 2000","isNumber":"17999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6725","citationCount":"88","articleId":"832522","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":832534,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The IRTF has singled out random early detection (RED) as one queue management scheme recommended for rapid deployment throughout the Internet. However, RED is not a thoroughly understood scheme-witness for example how the recommended parameter setting, or even the various benefits RED is claimed to provide, have changed over the past few years. In this paper, we describe simple analytic models for RED, and use these models to quantify the benefits (or lack thereof) brought about by RED. In particular, we examine the impact of RED on the loss and delay suffered by bursty and less bursty traffic (such as TCP and UDP traffic, respectively). We find that: (i) RED does eliminate the higher loss bias against bursty traffic observed with tail drop, but not by decreasing the loss rate of bursty traffic, rather by increasing that of non bursty traffic; (ii) the number of consecutive packet drops is higher with RED than tail drop, suggesting RED might not help as anticipated with the global synchronization of TCP flows; (iii) RED can be used to control the average queueing delay in routers and hence the end to end delay, but increases the jitter of non bursty streams. Thus, applications that generate smooth traffic, such as interactive audio applications, will suffer higher loss rates and require large playout buffers, thereby negating at least in part the lower mean delay brought about by RED.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832539","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000.

The capacity of a CDMA system is confined by the interference of users from both inside and outside of the target cell. Earlier algorithms for call admission control have been based on the effective traffic load for the target cell if one call is accepted. These algorithms ignore the interference effect of the to-be-accepted call on the neighboring cells. In our algorithms, the call admission decision is based on the effective traffic loads for both the target cell and the neighboring cells. In addition, to prioritize handoff calls, we also introduce the idea of a soft guard channel, which reserves some traffic load exclusively for handoff calls. Stochastic reward net (SRN) models are constructed to compare the performance of the algorithms. The numerical results show that our algorithms can significantly reduce the dropped calls with a price of increasing the blocked calls. To show the potential gain due to our algorithms, we introduce two new metrics: the increased blocking ratio for our algorithms and the increased dropping ratio for the conventional algorithms. From the numerical results, it is shown that our algorithms can reduce the dropped calls significantly while the blocked calls are increased at a relatively small rate under both homogeneous and hot spot traffic loads.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000.

This case arises when the source hierarchically encodes its signal and the hierarchical structure is predetermined. Unlike the case of the fractional layer allocation, which has been studied extensively in (Sarkar and Tassiulas, 1999), bandwidth can be allocated in discrete chunks only. Fairness issues become vastly different. Computation of lexicographic optimal rate allocation becomes NP-hard in this case, while lexicographic optimal rate allocation is polynomial complexity computable when fractional layers can be allocated. Furthermore, the maxmin fair rate vector may not exist in this case. We introduce a new notion of fairness, maximal fairness. We propose a polynomial complexity algorithm for computation of maximally fair rates allocated to various source-destination pairs. Even though maximal fairness is a weaker notion of fairness, it coincides with lexicographic optimality and maxmin fairness, when maxmin fair rate allocation exists. So the algorithm for computing maximally fair rate allocation computes maxmin fair rate allocation, when the latter exists.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832547/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Mar 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6559206","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2000","displayDocTitle":"Fair allocation of discrete bandwidth layers in multicast networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fair allocation of discrete bandwidth layers in multicast networks","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00832547.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036221S","chronDate":"26-30 Mar 2000","isNumber":"17999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6725","citationCount":"36","articleId":"832547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":832548,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The results on maximising the throughput obtained with GA-BAVP and CCO-BAVP are in close agreement, however when considering fairness GA-BAVP outperforms CCO-BAVP, especially for more complex topologies, like the 7-node network, without abundant link capacity. Convergence of the two algorithms appears similar, with GA-BAVP outperforming CCO-BAVP in initial stages, and vice-versa for longer time scales. However as the problem complexity increases the solution time for the genetic algorithm does not increase as fast as the classical constrained optimisation algorithm. A hybrid scheme is also introduced, combining the benefits of both algorithms. It exhibited better overall convergence rate but the same solution as CCO-BAVP.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000. Conference on Computer Communications.

We present a brief summary of existing results which indicates that most schemes require intermediaries (such as base stations) to monitor the TCP traffic and actively participate in flow control in order to enhance performance. Although these methods simulate end-to-end semantics, they do not comprise true end-to-end signaling. As a result, these techniques are not applicable when the IP payload is encrypted. For instance IPSEC, which is expected to be standard under IPv6, encrypts the entire IP payload making it impossible for intermediaries to monitor TCP traffic unless those entities are part of the security association. In addition, these schemes require changes (in the TCP/IP code) at intermediate nodes making it difficult for the mobile clients to inter-operate with the existing infrastructure. In this paper we explore the \"freeze-TCP\" mechanism which is a true end-to-end scheme and does not require the involvement of any intermediaries (such as base stations) for flow control. Furthermore, this scheme does not require any changes on the \"sender side\" or intermediate routers; changes in TCP code are restricted to the mobile client side, making it possible to fully inter-operate with the existing infrastructure. We then outline a method which integrates the best attributes of freeze-TCP and some existing solutions. Performance results highlight the importance of pro-active action/signaling by the mobile-host. The data indicate that in most cases, simply reacting to disconnections tends to yield lower performance than pro-active mechanisms such as freeze-TCP.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17999","startPage":"1537","endPage":"1545 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000.

To facilitate this, QoS multicast routing protocols are pivotal in enabling new receivers to join a multicast group. However, current routing protocols are either too restrictive in their search for a feasible path between a new receiver and the multicast tree, or burden the network with excessive overhead. We propose QMRP, a new Qos-aware multicast routing protocol. QMRP achieves scalability by significantly reducing the communication overhead in constructing a multicast tree, yet it retains a high chance of success. This is achieved by switching between single-path routing and multiple-path routing according to the current network conditions. The high-level design of QMRP makes it operable on top of any unicast routing algorithm both intra-domain and inter-domain. Its responsiveness is improved by using a termination mechanism which detects the failure as well as the success of routing without the use of timeout. In addition, QMRP always constructs loop-free multicast trees.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832558/","accessionNumber":"6559217","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A QoS-aware multicast routing protocol","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QoS-aware multicast routing protocol","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00832558.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037653S","chronDate":"26-30 Mar 2000","isNumber":"17999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6725","citationCount":"9","articleId":"832558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":832567,"authors":[{"name":"Tsunyi Tuan","affiliation":["Network Systems Laboratory Department of Computer Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Tsunyi Tuan","id":"37445131900"},{"name":"Kihong Park","affiliation":["Network Systems Laboratory Department of Computer Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Kihong Park","id":"37351532300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5880-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-166X"}],"articleNumber":"832567","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":53},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=832567","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Redundancy","Degradation","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Traffic control","Diffserv networks","Optimal control","Feedback loop","Stability","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","telecommunication traffic","redundancy","telecommunication congestion control","queueing theory","adaptive control","performance evaluation","transport protocols","feedback","delays","forward error correction","automatic repeat request","wide area networks","visual communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS-sensitive transport","real-time traffic","end-to-end QoS control","best-effort networks","differentiated service networks","self-similar burstiness","performance degradation","feedback loops","adaptive redundancy control","correlated packet drops","queueing delays","FEC","ARQ","WAN","preactivity","multiple-time-scale congestion control","AFEC-MT protocol","MPEG video"]}],"doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832567","endPage":"1692 vol.3","startPage":"1683","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000.

In previous work, we have shown how packet-level adaptive FEC can be used in dynamic networks to facilitate invariant user-specified QoS in an end-to-end manner. This paper addresses two important problems-self-similar burstiness and performance degradation of reactive controls subject to long feedback loops-complementing the stability/optimality considerations studied earlier. First, for adaptive redundancy control to be effective, its susceptibility to correlated packet drops and queueing delays stemming from self-similar burstiness must be fortified. Second, to preserve FEC's viability over ARQ when transporting real-time traffic in WAN, preactivity must be injected to offset the performance degradation of reactive feedback controls when subject to long RTT. In this paper, we use the recently advanced multiple-time-scale congestion control framework-first investigated in the throughput maximization context-to endow adaptive redundancy control with both selective protection against self-similar burstiness as well as preactivity to feedback redundancy control. We analyze, implement, and benchmark our protocol-AFEC-MT-in the context of transporting periodic real-time traffic, in particular, MPEG video.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832567/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"6559226","conferenceDate":"26-30 March 2000","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Multiple time scale redundancy control for QoS-sensitive transport of real-time traffic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple time scale redundancy control for QoS-sensitive transport of real-time traffic","confLoc":"Tel Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00832567.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05238S","chronDate":"26-30 Mar 2000","isNumber":"17999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6725","citationCount":"6","articleId":"832567","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":832571,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We demonstrate the major features of chaotic systems in TCP/IP networks with examples. These features include unpredictability, extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and odd periodicity. Previous work has shown the fractal nature of aggregate TCP/IP traffic and one explanation to this phenomenon was that traffic can be approximated by a large number of ON/OFF sources where the random ON and/or OFF periods are of length described by a heavy-tailed distribution. In this paper we show that this argument is not necessary to explain self-similarity, neither is randomness is required. Rather, TCP itself as a deterministic process creates chaos, which generates self-similarity. This property is inherent in today's TCP/IP networks and it is independent of higher layer applications or protocols. The two causes, heavy-tailed ON/OFF and chaotic TCP together contribute to the phenomenon, called the fractal nature of Internet traffic.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000.

The model has three parameters: the mean rate m, variance parameter a and the Hurst parameter H. Explicit expressions for the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates m/spl circ/ and a/spl circ/ in terms of H are given, as well as the expression for the log likelihood function from which the estimate H/spl circ/ is obtained as the maximizing argument. A geometric sequence of sampling points, t/sub i/=/spl alpha//sup i/, is introduced, which fits neatly into the self-similar property of the process and also reduces the number of samples needed to cover several time scales. It is shown that by a proper 'descaling' the traffic process is stationary on this grid leading to a Toeplitz-type covariance matrix. Approximations for the inverted covariance matrix and its determinant are introduced. The accuracy of the estimations is studied by simulations. Comparisons with estimates obtained with linear sampling and with the wavelet-based A-V estimator show that the geometrical sampling indeed improves the accuracy of the estimate H/spl circ/ with a given number of samples.","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832579","startPage":"1791","endPage":"1796 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM 2000.

The BLRNN is first expanded to its complex value version (C-BLRNN) for dealing with the complex input values. C-BLRNN is then applied to equalization of a digital satellite communication channel for M-PSK, which has severe nonlinearity with memory due to the traveling wave tube amplifier. The proposed C-BLRNN based equalizer for a channel model is compared with currently used Volterra filter equalizer and conventional complex MLPNN equalizer.

We show how DTRNN may be used to learn not the exact language that explains the whole learning set but an approximate and much simpler language that explains a great majority of the examples by using simpler rules. This is accomplished by gradually varying the error function in such a way that the DTRNN is eventually allowed to classify clearly but incorrectly those strings that it has found to be difficult to learn, which are treated as exceptions. The results show that in this way, the DTRNN usually manages to learn a simplified approximate language.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.832596","startPage":"1527","endPage":"1532 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

The proposed method can recognize the gross errors and small errors and treat them differently. Therefore this Huber training method is much more robust than traditional least-square l/sub 2/ methods, which is demonstrated through two examples, modeling of a quadratic function and transmission lines.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832618/","accessionNumber":"6589688","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-16 July 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Huber optimization of neural networks: a robust training method [microwave modeling]","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Huber optimization of neural networks: a robust training method [microwave modeling]","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00832618.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054513S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6674","citationCount":"4","articleId":"832618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":832621,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Little effort has been made to learn the amplitude of the activation functions, which defines the range of values that the function can take. This paper introduces novel algorithms to learn the amplitudes of nonlinear activations in layered networks, without any assumption on their analytical form. Three instances of the algorithms are developed: (i) a common amplitude is shared among all the nonlinear units; (ii) each layer has its own amplitude; (iii) neuron-specific amplitudes are allowed. Experimental results validate the approach to a large extent, showing a dramatic improvement in performance over the nets with fixed amplitudes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.1999.832650","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

In an effort to avoid complexities introduced by more advanced learning algorithms, the simple backpropagation with momentum algorithm has been employed. A member of classification problems were solved with neural networks that have been trained with the usual mean square error function, the mean absolute error function, the cross-entropy or maximum likelihood function, the Kalman-Kwasny error function (1991), as well as a novel error function designed by the authors.

To adapt to the complex and flexible architecture of arbitrary feed-forward neural network, partial order and topology order are introduced. Based on the exemplar vector, discrete degree and similarity degree are presented. In order to search redundant neurons and connections, the criterions of redundant neurons and connections are brought up. In order to keep up the original input-output behavior it is required to modify the remaining weights and threshold locally, and create new connections sometimes. The change to the related weights and thresholds can be obtained by constructing and solving a system of linear equations. Experimental results show this algorithm is very effective and feasible. The proposed algorithm is not only faster than general sparse algorithm but also can keep up the original performance and improve the generalization. So it is not required to retrain the neural network after pruning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832652/","accessionNumber":"6589722","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-16 July 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sparse algorithm for feed-forward neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse algorithm for feed-forward neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00832652.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030363S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6674","articleId":"832652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":832656,"authors":[{"name":"H.C.S.

The architecture of MRF-ART not only preserves the ART-type neural network characteristics but also extends their capability to represent input patterns in a hierarchical fashion. To achieve this, an MRF-ART network uses multiple output layers arranged in a cascaded manner which is completely different from a conventional fuzzy ART network with only one output layer. Moreover, the parallel matching process enables the parallel hardware implementation of an MRF-ART. To demonstrate the data representational capability of an MRF-ART network, we applied it to two data sets and the results indicated that fine-to-coarse data representation can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.832686","startPage":"1973","endPage":"1978 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

For this purpose, we propose a robot end-effector recognition system which automatically adapts to given conditions using a modular neural network. The robot end-effector can be seen in various shapes in images including translation, rotation and scaling of an original end-effector image. The designed modular network consists of several modules of neural networks, each of which employs a multilayer feedforward neural network. The modular neural network is used to recognize the robot's end-effector precisely and to minimize the processing time. Our experiments show that the performance of the modular neural network is superior to that of the single module neural network. The control system using the suggested modular neural network can perform the recognition with a high precision even under the very hard conditions : occlusion, cluttering, or various other motions.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.832697","startPage":"2032","endPage":"2036 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

For the application, specific hand gestures, such as \"fist\", \"index finger\" and \"victory sign\", have been defined. Most existing approaches use various camera-based recognition systems, which are rather costly and very sensitive to environmental changes. In contrast, this paper explores a data glove as the input device, which provides 18 measurement values for the angles of different finger joints. The paper compares the performance of different neural network models, such as backpropagation and radial-basis functions, which are used by the recognition system to recognize the actual gesture. Some network models achieve a recognition rate (training as well a generalization) of up to 100% over a number of test subjects. Due to its good performance, this recognition system is the first step towards virtual reality applications in which program execution is controlled by a sign language.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.832699","startPage":"2043","endPage":"2046 vol.3","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

However, conventional learning methodologies do not pay enough attention to the discontinuity of the inverse kinematics system of typical robot arms with joint limits. The inverse kinematics system of the robot arms, including a human arm with a wrist joint, is a multivalued and discontinuous function. Since it is difficult for a well-known multilayer neural network to approximate such a function, a correct inverse kinematics model for the end-effector's overall position and orientation cannot be obtained by the conventional methods. In order to overcome the drawbacks of the inverse kinematics solver consisting of a single neural network, we propose a novel modular neural network architecture for the inverse kinematics model learning.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.832704","startPage":"2065","endPage":"2070 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

The objective of the paper is to stabilize unknown systems by the adaptive control law through an optimization procedure in which a cost function representing the deviation error between set-points and the predicted outputs obtained from a neural network is minimized. Due to its capability of characterizing dynamic functional relationships and its feedback processing structure, a recurrent neural network is employed as an adaptive estimator for future state values. The neural network training is performed by the dynamic sequential recursive backpropagation learning algorithm, which allows the neural network to be trained online. It is shown that the proposed neural network learning algorithm has potential for designing flight control systems which can compensate for unpredictable changes in an aircraft dynamics over a wide range of flight conditions and other uncertainties.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832706/","accessionNumber":"6589776","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-16 July 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive control of aircraft dynamics using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive control of aircraft dynamics using neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00832706.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034178S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6674","citationCount":"1","articleId":"832706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":832709,"authors":[{"name":"D.

An output re-definition strategy is developed which is applicable to a class of open-loop stable nonlinear systems whose input-output maps contain nonlinear terms from output and linear terms from input. No a priori knowledge about the nonlinearities of the system is required. The output re-definition scheme is based on first identifying the nonlinearities of the system using neural networks and then modifying the system zero dynamics. A stable/anti-stable factorization is performed on the zero dynamics of the system. The new output is re-defined using the neural identifier and the stable part of the zero dynamics. A controller is then designed based on the new output whose zero dynamics are stable and can be inverted. For the flexible-link manipulator case, the controller is composed of a stabilizing joint PD controller and an output re-definition tracking controller. Experimental and simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme as compared to both linear and nonlinear conventional controllers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832717/","accessionNumber":"6589786","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-16 July 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Experimental results on neural network-based control strategies for flexible-link manipulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental results on neural network-based control strategies for flexible-link manipulators","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00832717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047635S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6674","citationCount":"1","articleId":"832717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":832721,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Estimation of (partial) channel impulse response and design of finite-length MMSE (minimum mean-square error) blind equalizers is investigated. The basis of the approach is the design of multiple zero-forcing equalizers that whiten the noise-free data at multiple delays. In the past such an approach has been considered using just one zero-forcing equalizer at zero-delay. Infinite impulse response (IIR) channels are allowed. Moreover, the multichannel transfer function need not be column-reduced. The proposed approach also works when the \"subchannel\" transfer functions have common zeros so long as the common zeros are minimum-phase zeros. The channel length or model orders need not be known. The sources are recovered up to a unitary mixing matrix and are further 'unmixed' using higher-order statistics of the data. An illustrative simulation example is provided.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New results on blind identification and equalization of MIMO channels/systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 38th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

Unfalsified control is used as a means of using both open and closed loop test data to identify a subset of controllers (from an initial set) that meets the multiple objectives specified by the control engineer. A novel feature of the unfalsified approach is that it allows the performance of a given controller to be predicted without inserting the controller in the loop. In addition, this methodology does not require an explicit model of the system to be controlled. When the unfalsified PI autotuning approach is applied to the industrial weigh belt feeder, it is able to successfully identify a subset of PI control laws that meets the performance specs. This automated PI tuning approach is implemented here off-line but may be implemented online and applied in a straight forward manner to other control systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1999.832885","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 38th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (Cat.

By incorporating the polychromatic characteristics of the X-ray beam into the reconstruction process, the algorithm is capable of eliminating beam hardening artifacts. The single energy version of the algorithm assumes that each voxel in the scan field can be expressed as a mixture of two known substances, for example, a mixture of trabecular bone and marrow, or a mixture of fat and flesh. These assumptions are easily satisfied in a quantitative computed tomography (QCT) setting. The authors have compared their algorithm to three commonly used single-energy correction techniques. Experimental results show that their algorithm is much more robust and accurate. The authors have also shown that QCT measurements obtained using their algorithm are five times more accurate than that from current QCT systems (using calibration). The dual-energy mode does not require any prior knowledge of the object in the scan field, and can be used to estimate the attenuation coefficient function of unknown materials. The authors have tested the dual-energy setup to obtain an accurate estimate for the attenuation coefficient function of K/sub 2/HPO/sub 4/ solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832955/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6568307","pubMedId":"10782614","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction algorithm for polychromatic CT imaging: application to beam hardening correction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction algorithm for polychromatic CT imaging: application to beam hardening correction","sourcePdf":"00832955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060662S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"18026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"76","articleId":"832955","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":832957,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In the past, they have presented three segmentation paradigms: live wire, live lane, and a three-dimensional (3-D) extension of the live-wire method. Here, they introduce an ultra-fast live-wire method, referred to as live wire on the fly for further reducing user's time compared to the basic live-wire method. In live wire, 3-D/four-dimensional (4-D) object boundaries are segmented in a slice-by-slice fashion. To segment a two-dimensional (2-D) boundary, the user initially picks a point on the boundary and all possible minimum-cost paths from this point to all other points in the image are computed via Dijkstra's algorithm. Subsequently, a live wire is displayed in real time from the initial point to any subsequent position taken by the cursor. If the cursor is close to the desired boundary, the live wire snaps on to the boundary. The cursor is then deposited and a new live-wire segment is found next. The entire 2-D boundary is specified via a set of live-wire segments in this fashion. A drawback of this method is that the speed of optimal path computation depends on image size. On modestly powered computers, for images of even modest size, some sluggishness appears in user interaction, which reduces the overall segmentation efficiency. In this work, the authors solve this problem by exploiting some known properties of graphs to avoid unnecessary minimum-cost path computation during segmentation. In live wire on the fly, when the user selects a point on the boundary the live-wire segment is computed and displayed in real time from the selected point to any subsequent position of the cursor in the image, even for large images and even on low-powered computers. Based on 492 tracing experiments from an actual medical application, the authors demonstrate that live wire on the fly is 1.331 times faster than live wire for actual segmentation for varying image sizes, although the pure computational part alone is found to be about 120 times faster.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/18026/00832960.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"62","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.832960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.832960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=832960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ultra-fast user-steered image segmentation paradigm: live wire on the fly","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Wire","Computer displays","Object recognition","Two dimensional displays","Medical services","Biomedical equipment","Application software","Image recognition","Radiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra-fast user-steered image segmentation paradigm","live wire on the fly","4-D object boundaries","slice-by-slice fashion","3-D object boundaries","minimum-cost paths","Dijkstra's algorithm","medical diagnostic imaging","medical application"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Computer Graphics","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Magnetic Resonance Imaging","User-Computer Interface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2000","displayDocTitle":"An ultra-fast user-steered image segmentation paradigm: live wire on the fly","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2000","accessionNumber":"6573678","pubMedId":"10782619","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ultra-fast user-steered image segmentation paradigm: live wire on the fly","sourcePdf":"00832960.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037378S","chronDate":"Jan.  2000","isNumber":"18026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"191","articleId":"832960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":832962,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

In this paper, a novel smart antenna concept applying receiver antenna diversity at the uplink receiver is investigated for a time-slotted code-division multiple-access (CDMA) mobile radio air interface termed time-division CDMA (TD-CDMA), which has been selected by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in January 1998 to form part of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) air interface standard. First, a combined direction-of-arrival (DOA) and joint channel estimation scheme is presented, which is based on DOA estimation using the Unitary ESPRIT algorithm and maximum likelihood estimation of the channel impulse responses associated with the estimated DOA's, which can also be used as an input for advanced mobile positioning schemes in UMTS. The performance of the combined DOA and joint channel estimation is compared with the conventional channel estimation through simulations in rural and urban propagation environments. Moreover, a novel joint data detection scheme is considered, which explicitly takes into account the signal DOA's and the associated channel impulse responses. The link level performance of a TD-CDMA mobile radio system using these novel schemes is evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations of data transmission, and average bit error rates (BER's) are determined for rural and urban propagation environments. The simulation results indicate that, depending on the propagation environment, the exploitation of the knowledge of the directional inhomogeneity of the mobile radio channel can lead to considerable system performance enhancements.","doi":"10.1109/25.832962","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18027/00832962.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.832962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart antennas for combined DOA and joint channel estimation in time-slotted CDMA mobile radio systems with joint detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=832962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832962/","displayDocTitle":"Smart antennas for combined DOA and joint channel estimation in time-slotted CDMA mobile radio systems with joint detection","volume":"49","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6579732","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart antennas for combined DOA and joint channel estimation in time-slotted CDMA mobile radio systems with joint detection","sourcePdf":"00832962.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06279S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"58","articleId":"832962","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":832963,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The multiaccess capability of the code-division multiple-access (CDMA) technique has been widely investigated in the recent literature. The aim of this paper is to propose a CDMA-based protocol for joint voice and data transmissions in PCN's. The performance of such a protocol has been derived by means of an analytical approach both in terms of voice packet dropping probability and mean data packet delay. Voice traffic has been modeled as having alternated talkspurts and silences, with generation of voice packets at constant rate during talkspurts and no packet generation during silence gaps. A general arrival process is assumed for the data traffic. However, numerical results are derived in the case of a Poisson process. Simulation results are given to validate our analytical predictions. The main result derived here is that the proposed CDMA-based protocol efficiently handles both voice and data traffic. In particular, it is shown that the performance of the voice subsystem is independent of the data traffic.","doi":"10.1109/25.832963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18027/00832963.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.832963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of a CDMA protocol for voice and data integration in personal communication networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=832963","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832963/","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of a CDMA protocol for voice and data integration in personal communication networks","volume":"49","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6579733","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of a CDMA protocol for voice and data integration in personal communication networks","sourcePdf":"00832963.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055047S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"40","articleId":"832963","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":832964,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Each macrocell is partitioned into microcells, and some of the channels originally allocated to the macrocell are assigned to the microlayer cells according to a reuse pattern. The arriving calls are classified as fast or slow; fast calls are always assigned only to macrocell channels, whereas for slow calls a microcell channel is first sought. Slow calls may be allowed to overflow to the macrolayer, but may be repacked to vacated microcell channels. Calls can change their mobility class during a conversation. We develop an approximate analysis for computing the slow and fast call blocking probabilities in such a system. We adopt the technique of analyzing an isolated macrocell with the Poisson arrival assumption and then iterating on the stationary analysis of the isolated macrocell to obtain stationary results for the multicell system. Simple, but accurate approximations are developed for analyzing the isolated macrocell and its associated microcells. The analyses based on the approximate isolated cell model are validated against simulations of a multicell model.","doi":"10.1109/25.832964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18027/00832964.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.832964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18027","startPage":"321","endPage":"333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of microcellization for supporting two mobility classes in cellular wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=832964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of microcellization for supporting two mobility classes in cellular wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832964/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6579734","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of microcellization for supporting two mobility classes in cellular wireless networks","sourcePdf":"00832964.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044912S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"28","articleId":"832964","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":832965,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Rong Chang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Po-Rong Chang","id":"37287470000"},{"name":"Chin-Feng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Feng Lin","id":"37366150200"},{"name":"M.J.

Three-dimensional visual communications, made through the use of stereoscopic images, are able to achieve total display realism. Such services allow users to share the virtual reality (VR) world without any geographical restrictions. In order to create a 3-D system with two images (left and right) that should be transmitted over a bandlimited mobile channel simultaneously, a cost-effective motion picture experts group (MPEG)-based wavelet multiresolution coding with a joint motion and disparity compensation is developed to reduce a large amount of information contained in the images to meet the low-transmission rate limitation of mobile channels. However, the rapidly variable bit rate (VBR) characteristics of the MPEG-based 3-D videos seems a weakness to the transmission of such videos via a constant bit-rate (CBR) mobile channel. The ATM technique is especially well suited for VBR MPEG-based 3-D video because of its ability to allocate bandwidth on demand to these services. However, since the mobile radio has a limited channel capacity, the overall capacity of the traditional ATM-based SS-CDMA system may not be sufficient to accommodate the MPEG-based 3-D video services requested by the multiple mobile users simultaneously. To tackle this difficulty, a multicode CDMA technique is proposed to provide VBR MPEG-based 3-D video services by varying the number of spreading codes assigned to the 3-D video to meet its dynamic throughput requirement. Powerful forward error correction (FEC) codes are necessary to protect the video data so that it can be successfully transmitted at an acceptable signal power level. Two separate FEC code schemes are applied to the header and payload of an ATM cell containing 3-D video data, respectively. The ATM cell header is protected by a relatively powerful FEC code to ensure correct delivery and low cell loss rate (CLR). On the other hand, the ATM cell payload is encoded for varying degrees of error protection according to the priority of the payload data in 3-D videos. An adaptive FEC code combining scheme is proposed to provide the good protection for payload data with the maximization of its code rate to minimize the extra bandwidth for FEC overhead.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18027/00832965.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.832965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.832965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=832965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of multicode CDMA systems for 3-D stereoscopic video over wireless ATM networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Forward error correction","Video on demand","Protection","Payloads","Asynchronous transfer mode","Video sharing","Virtual reality","Bandwidth","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","asynchronous transfer mode","visual communication","video coding","forward error correction","error correction codes","stereo image processing","spread spectrum communication","wavelet transforms","transform coding","motion compensation","variable rate codes","code standards","adaptive codes","multimedia communication","cellular radio","telecommunication channels","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design","multicode CDMA systems","3D stereoscopic video","wireless ATM networks","multicode spread-spectrum code-division multiple-access techniques","video transmission","wireless asynchronous transfer mode networks","three-dimensional visual communications","virtual reality world","geographical restrictions","bandlimited mobile channel","MPEG-based wavelet multiresolution coding","disparity compensation","motion compensation","low-transmission rate limitation","mobile channels","rapidly variable bit rate characteristics","constant bit-rate mobile channel","channel capacity","multiple mobile users","dynamic throughput requirement","forward error correction codes","signal power level","FEC code schemes","low cell loss rate","ATM cell payload","error protection","adaptive FEC code combining scheme","maximization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Design of multicode CDMA systems for 3-D stereoscopic video over wireless ATM networks","volume":"49","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6579735","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of multicode CDMA systems for 3-D stereoscopic video over wireless ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00832965.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057674S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","articleId":"832965","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":832968,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Multiuser receivers provide a solution to these problems, but they require knowledge of parameters of the MAI and are computationally complex. Adaptive single-user receivers, however, do not require knowledge of MAI parameters and need fewer computations. This paper discusses a wide range of adaptive single-user receivers found in the literature and presents their performance results under a unified framework to provide a basis of comparison. Results indicate that, compared to the conventional receiver, adaptive single-user receivers provide large gains in system capacity and are near-far resistant. It is shown that fractionally spaced adaptive receivers, which exploit spectral correlation due to the cyclostationary nature of the DSSS signal, perform better than adaptive receivers that cannot exploit this correlation. Multipath results presented for two-ray and urban channels indicate that fractionally spaced adaptive receivers act as RAKE receivers.","doi":"10.1109/25.832968","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18027/00832968.pdf","startPage":"379","endPage":"389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.832968","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive single-user receivers for direct-sequence spread-spectrum CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=832968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832968/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive single-user receivers for direct-sequence spread-spectrum CDMA systems","volume":"49","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6579738","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive single-user receivers for direct-sequence spread-spectrum CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"00832968.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044066S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"18","articleId":"832968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":832970,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Typical delay profiles are measured to clarify their statistical characteristics in LOS street microcells. The channel sounder used is a sliding correlator with 30-Mb/s PN code and a center frequency of 2.6 GHz. The measurements clarify the features of delay profile and mean RMS delay spread. The proposed delay profile model explains one plausible mechanism of multipath propagation. The delay profiles calculated using the model agreed well with the measured profiles. Furthermore, the factors influencing the RMSs delay spread are investigated, and the regression equation of medium RMS delay spread on a sidewalk is established. The proposed model can evaluate the transmission characteristics of wireless digital communication systems in multipath propagation environments.","doi":"10.1109/25.832973","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18027/00832973.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.832973","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18027","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"422","endPage":"427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multipath propagation model for line-of-sight street microcells in urban area","volume":"49","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6579743","publicationDate":"March 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832973/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipath propagation model for line-of-sight street microcells in urban area","sourcePdf":"00832973.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026111S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"24","articleId":"832973","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":832975,"authors":[{"name":"K.I.

The services are partitioned into different traffic classes according to information rate (bandwidth) and quality of service (QoS) requirements. Given sufficient bandwidth, QoS requirements can be satisfied by an appropriate assignment of transmitted power and processing gain to users in each class. The effect of this assignment is analyzed for both a single class of data users and two classes of voice and data users. For a single class of data users, we examine the relationship between average delay and processing gain, assuming that ARQ with forward error correction is used to guarantee reliability. The only channel impairment considered is interference, which is modeled as Gaussian noise. A fixed user population is assumed and two models for generation of data packets are considered: (1) each user generates a new packet as soon as the preceding packet is successfully delivered and (2) each user generates packets according to a Poisson process. In each case, the packets enter a buffer which is emptied at the symbol rate. For the second traffic model, lowering the processing gain below a threshold can produce multiple operating points, one of which corresponds to infinite delay. The choice of processing gain which minimizes average delay in that case is the smallest processing gain at which multiple operating points are avoided. Two classes of users (voice/data and two data classes) are then considered. Numerical examples are presented which illustrate, the increase in the two-dimensional (2-D) capacity region achievable by optimizing the assignment of powers and processing gains to each class.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","volume":"49","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6579752","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation for multiple classes of DS-CDMA traffic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation for multiple classes of DS-CDMA traffic","sourcePdf":"00832982.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047237S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"80","articleId":"832982","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":832986,"authors":[{"name":"B.D.

The transmitted signal is distorted by a time-varying frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel and corrupted by additive Gaussian noise. The received signal is unsynchronized in that there are residual carrier frequency, carrier phase, and symbol timing offsets. The PT-MLSD treats the channel as a stochastic process, and so symbol sequences are distinguished by their autocovariances. Coherent communication is possible even in overspread channels. As the sequences' autocovariances explicitly account for the channel's time variation, the PT-MLSD's bit error rate (BER) floor is normally lower than the BER floor suffered by receivers that estimate the channel impulse response conventionally. Both the data-bearing signal and pilot tone are used together for synchronization, equalization, and detection. The pilot tone is only needed to remove the constellation's phase ambiguity and provide a stable amplitude reference for QAM constellations. It is not needed for estimating the channel impulse response. The pilot tone does not require a spectral null for its insertion, and it does not significantly degrade the peak-to-average or maximum-to-minimum power ratios. Thus, many of the disadvantages of other pilot tone systems are avoided, as there is no bandwidth expansion, and linear amplification is not made appreciably more difficult.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.832986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18027","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18027/00832986.pdf","endPage":"560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood sequence detection using a pilot tone","doi":"10.1109/25.832986","startPage":"550","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=832986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood sequence detection using a pilot tone","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832986/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6579756","publicationDate":"March 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"49","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood sequence detection using a pilot tone","sourcePdf":"00832986.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081858S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","articleId":"832986","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":832987,"authors":[{"name":"Wanshi Chen","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Research Laboratory, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Wanshi Chen","id":"38184087300"},{"name":"Manh Anh Do","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Research Laboratory, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Manh Anh Do","id":"37267984600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"832987","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Multiaccess communication","Fading","Detectors","Error probability","Phase estimation","Timing","Delay","Mean square error methods","Multiple access interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","error statistics","fading channels","code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","adaptive signal detection","receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive MMSE reception","DS-CDMA","flat Nakagami fading channels","performance analysis","minimum mean square error detector","direct-sequence code-division multiple-access"]}],"abstract":"An efficient method is derived in this paper to obviate the integral involved in the performance analysis of the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector for direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS/CDMA) systems in fading environments.

System capacities of VSG-CDMA networks with and without considering user activity factors were derived. The analysis gives a lower bound of system capacity because a user's transmitted power is considered part of the interference to its own signal. In this paper, we present an optimistic upper bound assuming that there is no multipath fading or the energy of a signal in all multipath components can be fully resolved. An optimum power vector assignment and a simple criterion for all users to simultaneously achieve their quality of service (QoS) requirements (in terms of bit energy-to-interference density ratios) are derived. We found from numerical examples that, compared with the lower bound given in I and Sabnani, significant improvement can be obtained if multipath fading can be satisfactorily handled.

By assuming a symmetric channel, the performance analysis of the overall system is determined by the performance of an arbitrarily selected user, called the tagged user. The service time distribution for the tagged user buffer is found using a state flow graph. This distribution is then applied to the queueing analysis of the tagged user using available classical queueing theory results. The proposed approach can be applied to analysis of systems with a very large user population and user buffer capacity. The distributions and mean values of the important performance indices such as waiting time, queue size, and interdeparture time are obtained. The stability of the system with infinite buffer capacity is also studied. The region of transmission probability p in which the system is always stable and has best performance is obtained. Though the system with finite buffer capacity is considered to be always stable, a comprehensive analysis of the equilibrium points in the system is presented. The analysis presented will allow a proper choice of transmission probability so that the system always operates at the desired equilibrium point.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"49","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6579760","displayDocTitle":"Performance and stability analysis of buffered slotted ALOHA protocols using tagged user approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance and stability analysis of buffered slotted ALOHA protocols using tagged user approach","sourcePdf":"00832990.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028898S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"52","articleId":"832990","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":832994,"authors":[{"name":"W.M.

Ray methods have been particularly popular, and there are many papers in the literature describing the performance of various approaches to ray tracing. This paper describes a powerful three-dimensional (3-D) software suite for urban propagation modeling which, although based on 3-D ray tracing (using images), draws upon an ensemble of propagation tools including physical optics using the fast far-field approximation, the parabolic equation approximation for propagation over multiple buildings, and uniform theory of diffraction (UTD). Many ray-tracing methods determine ray paths between the transmitter and a single arbitrary receiver This paper adopts an approach of a transmitter to a multiple receiver technique, resulting in greatly reduced computational times. The associated method can handle both indoor and outdoor propagation on both flat and undulating terrain. Terrain is represented as a set of triangular two-dimensional (2-D) patches, while buildings and clutter are represented using layers of polygons.","doi":"10.1109/25.832994","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.832994","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18027/00832994.pdf","startPage":"622","endPage":"630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient implementation of a three-dimensional microcell propagation tool for indoor and outdoor urban environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"An efficient implementation of a three-dimensional microcell propagation tool for indoor and outdoor urban environments","volume":"49","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6579764","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient implementation of a three-dimensional microcell propagation tool for indoor and outdoor urban environments","sourcePdf":"00832994.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045644S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"31","articleId":"832994","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":832995,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The aim of this paper is to provide help in selecting the appropriate level of accuracy required in these databases in order to achieve the best tradeoff between database costs and prediction accuracy. The effects of inaccuracies in these databases are presented and analyzed by comparing predictions and measurements. The results presented here show to what extent errors, which are due to automatic vectorization of scanned maps, could lead to erroneous predictions. Furthermore, an analysis of the influence of random errors in a building vector database was performed to quantify the prediction error as a function of the accuracy in the building vector databases. Ray-tracing prediction models implementing a reflection and diffraction phenomena were found to be sensitive to the choice of the reflection coefficient attributed to building walls. This dependence can be used to fit the measurements as the complexity of real building walls does not allow one to easily derive their electrical parameters from which a reflection coefficient could be computed. It was also found that, in general and in agreement with measurements, ray-tracing-based prediction models are not sensitive to small variations on a base-station location. Finally, the sensitivity study also lead to gained insight of the propagation phenomena involved in urban microcell environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of database accuracy on two-dimensional ray-tracing-based predictions in urban microcells","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.832995","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/18027/00832995.pdf","startPage":"631","endPage":"642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.832995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18027","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=832995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/832995/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Influence of database accuracy on two-dimensional ray-tracing-based predictions in urban microcells","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6579765","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of database accuracy on two-dimensional ray-tracing-based predictions in urban microcells","sourcePdf":"00832995.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035459S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18027","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"28","articleId":"832995","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":832996,"authors":[{"name":"P.B.

Then consider adding error-correction code (ECC) circuitry as well. Its presence boosts yield and reduces problems with random single-cell defects in memory arrays. Admittedly, the addition also expands chip area and impacts performance, but the payoff is almost always worth it. For instance, a memory that uses ECC will be more reliable in the field because a single memory cell failure will be corrected and not bring down the system; moreover, the now defective system component will not have to be replaced until the next scheduled maintenance. In fact, with ECC, 1 bit in every memory word can be bad and the memory will still operate correctly.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","pdfPath":"/iel5/6/18030/00833029.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"60","publicationTitle":"IEEE Spectrum","doi":"10.1109/6.833029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/6.833029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18030","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=833029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adding error-correcting circuitry to ASIC memory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Application specific integrated circuits","Error correction codes","Random access memory","Read only memory","Read-write memory","Alpha particles","FCC","Parity check codes","Petroleum","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","error correction codes","random-access storage","read-only storage","memory architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error-correcting circuitry","ASIC memory","yield improvement","random single-cell defects","memory arrays","chip area","performance","memory cell failure","XOR logic design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/833029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2000","displayDocTitle":"Adding error-correcting circuitry to ASIC memory","volume":"37","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6562535","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adding error-correcting circuitry to ASIC memory","sourcePdf":"0400-0554ECClo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028288S","chronDate":"April  2000","isNumber":"18030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6","citationCount":"9","articleId":"833029","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":833062,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The transmit antenna was omnidirectional and placed high above rooftops. The receiver antenna, a 21/spl times/41 element rectangular synthetic array, was located on the roof of a van. The refined high-resolution evaluation method, particularly robust against nonstationary signal components, allows an angular resolution of better than 1/spl deg/ in both azimuth and elevation and a delay resolution of 33 ns. Combined angular/temporal domain measurements are crucial for the understanding of the propagation mechanisms. The evaluated sites showed strongly street-dominated propagation. We found a combined circular and rectangular distribution of scatterers around the mobile station in street-dominated environments. Propagation over the roofs was significant; typically 65% of energy was incident with elevation larger than 100. Our results corroborate the hypothesis on the importance of multiple reflections/diffractions in urban macro cells. We explain this behavior by two reasons: narrow streets favoring a canyon effect and strong scatterers without line-of-sight (LOS) to the mobile station.","doi":"10.1109/8.833062","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/18033/00833062.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.833062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directional macro-cell channel characterization from urban measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=833062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/833062/","displayDocTitle":"Directional macro-cell channel characterization from urban measurements","volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6574596","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directional macro-cell channel characterization from urban measurements","sourcePdf":"00833062.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0453S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"149","articleId":"833062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":833068,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

The implementation of the lossy 2TDLM (L2TDLM) ABC is presented. It is shown that in contrast to the one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) versions, the full 3-D ABC requires a three time-derivative Lorentz material in the edge and corner regions to achieve a rigorous matching of the resulting Maxwellian absorbing layer to the lossy medium. The 3-D ABC implementation thus requires the introduction of an auxiliary field to handle the edge and corner regions to achieve a state-space form of the update equations in the ABC layers. Fully 3-D examples including pulsed dipole radiation and pulsed Gaussian beam propagation in lossless and lossy materials as well as pulse propagation along a microstrip over lossless and lossy materials are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the L2TDLM ABC.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/18033/00833069.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.833069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.833069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18033","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=833069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maxwellian material-based absorbing boundary conditions for lossy media in 3-D","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boundary conditions","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Propagation losses","Dielectric losses","Two dimensional displays","Computational modeling","Maxwell equations","Electromagnetic propagation","Microstrip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["absorbing media","finite difference time-domain analysis","electromagnetic wave propagation","electromagnetic wave absorption","microstrip antennas","antenna theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Maxwellian material-based absorbing boundary conditions","3D lossy media","two time-derivative Lorentz material","absorbing layer","complete absorbing boundary condition","three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulators","FDTD simulators","lossy 2TDLM","three time-derivative Lorentz material","auxiliary field","corner region","edge region","state-space form","pulsed dipole radiation","pulsed Gaussian beam propagation","pulse propagation","microstrip","lossless materials"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/833069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"Maxwellian material-based absorbing boundary conditions for lossy media in 3-D","volume":"48","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6574603","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maxwellian material-based absorbing boundary conditions for lossy media in 3-D","sourcePdf":"00833069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043105S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"19","articleId":"833069","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":833072,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

The method, referred to as a shift map, generalizes that of Beilis and Tappert (1979) who introduced a coordinate transformation technique to flatten the boundary. This technique is extended to a wide-angle form, allowing larger propagation angles with respect to the horizon. A new impedance boundary condition is derived for electromagnetic waves incident on a finitely conducting surface that enables solution of the parabolic wave (PWE) using the previously developed mixed Fourier transform. It is also shown by example that in many cases of interest, the boundary may be approximated by discrete piecewise linear segments without affecting the field solution. A more accurate shift map solution of the PWE for a piecewise linear boundary is, therefore, developed for modeling propagation over digitally sampled terrain data. The shift-map solution is applied to various surface types, including ramps, wedges, curved obstacles, and actual terrain. Where possible, comparisons are made between the numerical solution and an exact analytical form. The examples demonstrate that the shift map performs well for surface slopes as large as 10-15/spl deg/ and discontinuous slope changes on the order of 15-20/spl deg/. To accommodate a larger range of slopes, it is suggested that the most viable solution for general terrain modeling is a hybrid of the shift map with the well-known terrain masking (knife-edge diffraction) approximation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/833076/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6579701","volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Propagation modeling over terrain using the parabolic wave equation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation modeling over terrain using the parabolic wave equation","sourcePdf":"00833076.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038372S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"109","articleId":"833076","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":833077,"authors":[{"name":"C.T.

If such a mode is projected into an antenna aperture and radiated directly, then a doughnut-shaped radiation pattern with a boresight null will result. Antenna designs to directly accommodate an azimuthally symmetric output mode and the high electric fields of high-power sources have been considered, but they tend to be low gain, do not radiate a boresight peak along the axis of the source, and the pattern peak direction changes with frequency. Mode conversion techniques to alter the aperture field distribution have also been explored, but losses and weight, size and cost additions impact negatively on total system design. This paper describes a novel antenna we call the coaxial beam-rotating antenna (COBRA) that mitigates many of the problems normally associated with the azimuthally symmetric output modes of high-power microwave sources. The COBRA accepts directly an azimuthally symmetric guided mode of a microwave source and radiates a high-gain pattern with a boresight peak. In addition, the COBRA operates with a wide bandwidth, is compatible with the intense electric fields associated with high-power microwave sources, and the geometry of the antenna can be easily configured to produce an arbitrarily (elliptically) polarized boresight field. This paper presents the fundamental theory of operation, derives pertinent design and performance equations, and gives the measured operating characteristics of a COBRA prototype.","doi":"10.1109/8.833080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/18033/00833080.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.833080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The coaxial beam-rotating antenna (COBRA): theory of operation and measured performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=833080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/833080/","displayDocTitle":"The coaxial beam-rotating antenna (COBRA): theory of operation and measured performance","volume":"48","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6579705","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The coaxial beam-rotating antenna (COBRA): theory of operation and measured performance","sourcePdf":"00833080.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039905S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"30","articleId":"833080","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":833081,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Chyuan Lin","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Chyuan Lin","id":"37366152300"},{"name":"Ching-Kuang Cliver Tzuang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Kuang Cliver Tzuang","id":"37283227800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"833081","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1395},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip antennas","Coplanar waveguides","Frequency","Microwave antennas","Circuits","K-band","Antenna accessories","Impedance","Bandwidth","Polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multibeam antennas","coplanar waveguides","leaky wave antennas","electromagnetic wave polarisation","microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-beam micro-CPW leaky-mode antenna","quasi-planar leaky-mode antenna","second higher order leaky mode","antenna configuration","microstrip","coplanar waveguide","micro-CPW antenna","CPW line","K-band","gain","efficiency","radiation contours","active integrated antenna integration","microwave frequencies","millimeter-wave frequencies","21.927 to 23.110 GHz","90.02 percent","11.0 dB"]}],"abstract":"A quasi-planar leaky-mode antenna employing the second higher order leaky mode of even symmetry in its leaky-wave regime has been proposed for a new antenna configuration consisting of a microstrip and a coplanar waveguide (CPW) on both sides of the substrate.

This method uses reference patterns as items of evidence regarding the class membership of each input pattern under consideration.

This procedure can be implemented in a multilayer neural network with specific architecture consisting of one input layer, two hidden layers and one output layer. The weight vector, the receptive field and the class membership of each prototype are determined by minimizing the mean squared differences between the classifier outputs and target values. After training, the classifier computes for each input vector a BBA that provides a description of the uncertainty pertaining to the class of the current pattern, given the available evidence. This information may be used to implement various decision rules allowing for ambiguous pattern rejection and novelty detection. The outputs of several classifiers may also be combined in a sensor fusion context, yielding decision procedures which are very robust to sensor failures or changes in the system environment. Experiments with simulated and real data demonstrate the excellent performance of this classification scheme as compared to existing statistical and neural network techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/18034/00833094.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","doi":"10.1109/3468.833094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3468.833094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18034","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=833094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network classifier based on Dempster-Shafer theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Prototypes","Computer architecture","Uncertainty","Sensor fusion","Artificial neural networks","Pattern classification","Pattern recognition","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern classification","inference mechanisms","uncertainty handling","multilayer perceptrons","least mean squares methods","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network classifier","Dempster-Shafer theory","adaptive pattern classifier","evidence theory","basic belief assignments","BBA","multilayer neural network","weight vector","receptive field","class membership","mean squared difference minimization","sensor fusion","statistical techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/833094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"A neural network classifier based on Dempster-Shafer theory","volume":"30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6568460","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network classifier based on Dempster-Shafer theory","sourcePdf":"00833094.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036293S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"249","articleId":"833094","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":833108,"authors":[{"name":"Tei-Wei Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tei-Wei Kuo","id":"37276775300"},{"name":"Shao-Juen Ho","affiliation":["Inventec Corporation"],"lastName":"Shao-Juen Ho","id":"37439703100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"833108","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Frequency","Transaction databases","Concurrency control","Air traffic control","Guidelines","Processor scheduling","Aerospace electronics","Error correction","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data integrity","concurrency control","real-time systems","database management systems","performance evaluation","air traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["similarity-based load adjustment","static real-time transaction systems","application semantics","performance","correctness criteria","semantica-based concurrency control algorithms","data consistency","system workload","simulation experiments","air traffic control example"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=833108","abstract":"How to exploit application semantics to improve the performance of a real-time data-intensive application has been an active research topic in the past few years.

The task is to move the end-effector along a prescribed geometric path (state equality constraints). In order to address a structure of time-optimal control, the concept of a regular trajectory derived in Pontryagin et al. (1961) and the extended state space introduced herein are used. Next, it is proved that if the dynamics of a manipulator are defined by n actuators and m path-constrained equations, where m<n, then at most n-m+1 actuators are saturated, provided that the time-optimal manipulator trajectory is regular with respect to a prescribed geometric path given in the work space. Besides, it is shown that these results are also consistent for a point-to-point time-optimal control problem. A computer example involving a planar redundant manipulator of three revolute kinematic pairs is included which confirms the obtained theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/70.833194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.833194","endPage":"93","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/70/18036/00833194.pdf","startPage":"89","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time-optimal controls of kinematically redundant manipulators with geometric constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/833194/","displayDocTitle":"Time-optimal controls of kinematically redundant manipulators with geometric constraints","volume":"16","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6570751","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-optimal controls of kinematically redundant manipulators with geometric constraints","sourcePdf":"00833194.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043839S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"34","articleId":"833194","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":833204,"authors":[{"name":"G.A.

The resulting closed-loop system may be viewed as a hybrid system that incorporates discrete event driven data that act upon the continuous-time component (the plant) of the entire system. For linear systems that are stabilizable by linear time-invariant feedback, we propose a quantized sampled-data control policy which globally and exponentially stabilizes the systems. Furthermore, we show that by appropriately choosing the saturation levels, the proposed control policy is robust in the presence of certain classes of perturbations.

In this paper, we first formulate the minimum energy coding problem for RF transmission. We then derive the energy optimal source coding algorithm from the source statistics. Finally, we combine this energy optimal source coding algorithm with Hamming codes for energy efficient error recovery.

The model exhibits very interesting features such as segmentation, feature extraction, orientation independence and noise tolerance. Segmentation means that the output pattern depends strongly on the spatial location of the pixels in respect to one other. Feature extraction means that if the input image includes several patterns, then it is very likely the temporal output is a superposition of features in that image. The output temporal pattern is independent of the orientation of image or orientation of fragments of the image. With relatively low noise (less than 10%) the output pattern is virtually independent of the noise.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.833424","pdfPath":"/iel5/6674/18002/00833424.pdf","startPage":"2310","endPage":"2314 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

Due to the variability observed in the responses of electrically stimulated muscles, several adaptive control techniques have been developed. The pattern shaper (PS) is an adaptive neural network that has been tested in a software implementation and has been shown to be capable of automatically generating cyclic patterns that are customized for an individual. The results of these tests are encouraging, but implementation of the real-time algorithm currently requires a dedicated PC. The purpose of this research is to develop a hardware implementation of a digital PS neural network to generate the electrical signals to stimulate muscles in individuals with spinal cord injury. We have implemented the pattern shaper algorithm in hardware by mapping the digital logic circuit to a field programmable gate array (FPGA), developed a user interface to input data to the FPGA from a computer, and constructed a wire-wrapped board to implement the PS in hardware for use in clinical tests. This hardware implementation is a step towards the development of low-power, portable, adaptive controller that can be used in electrical stimulation systems.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.833425","startPage":"2315","endPage":"2318 vol.4","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of hardware backpropagation training in an optical system. The network uses the trainable light steering behavior of an optical nonlinear material to implement both neural processing and connectivity. The nonlinear material steers (by modulation of the phase front) a forward propagating information beam by dynamically altering the index of the refraction profile of the material via a stronger weighting beam. Effectively, the weight beam creates spatially varying lensing effects in the nonlinear material. These trainable effects steer the information beam to produce the correct output value at an optical detector. A photorefractive crystal is used as a phase conjugate mirror to generate the backpropagated optical error. This backpropagated optical error is detected and used in a gradient descent algorithm to update the weighting beam profile in real time. Both computer simulation and experimental results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.833433","startPage":"2351","endPage":"2356 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

The performance of single analog neurons and multilayer analog neural networks are studied. We consider a system identification model with a target and tracking neural network. The target weights are described by a stochastic difference equation with weights changing slowly with time. The tracker weights follow the least mean square (LMS) gradient descent algorithm and at each update are given a noise corrupted value of the output of the target network. When inputs are Gaussian and the activation used is the Gaussian error function, g(x)=1//spl radic/(2/spl pi/)/spl int//sub -x//sup x/e(-t/sup 2/2/)dt. The analysis is tractable. The dynamics of target and tracking networks are described by a set of stochastic difference equations. We obtain an approximation of the mean squared generalization error by linearizing the nonlinear difference equations and using simple probabilistic arguments. Analytical results are then confirmed with simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.833445","pdfPath":"/iel5/6674/18002/00833445.pdf","startPage":"2406","endPage":"2409 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

The proposed unsupervised competitive neural network, called weighted centroid neural network (WCNN), utilizes the characteristics of image blocks from edge areas. The mean/residual VQ (M/R VQ)) scheme is utilized in this proposed approach as the frame work of the proposed algorithm. A novel measure for calculating edge strength is devised by using the residue of an image block data from the M/R scheme. The edge strength of an image block data is then utilized as a tool to allocate the proper code vectors in the proposed WCNN. The WCNN successfully allocates more code vectors to the image block data from edge area while it allocates less code vectors to the image block data from shade or non-edge area when compared to conventional the neural network based VQ algorithm. As a result, a simple application of WCNN to image compression problem gives improved edge characteristics in reproduced images over conventional neural network based VQ algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.833499","startPage":"2668","endPage":"2673 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

It is a three-layer neural network with the input layer specified by spectral signatures of a mixed pixel vector, the hidden layer used for nonlinear mixing functions and the output layer used to produce classification results of the mixed pixel vector. A noise estimation method in conjunction with noise subspace projection is developed to reliably estimate the member of mixing materials plus interference signatures that can be used as the number of hidden nodes as well as the member of input nodes. The least-mean-square learning algorithm is applied to adjust parameters used in the hidden layer and weights of the output layers adaptively and simultaneously so as to achieve best possible performance. The performance is evaluated through a series of experiments via AVIRIS data. A comparative analysis is also conducted among various methods.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.833505","startPage":"2698","endPage":"2703 vol.4","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

Although simple linear methods for the calibration assuming an ideal projection model are available, their solutions are usually not accurate since most off-the-shelf lenses used in machine vision applications sustain considerable amount of nonlinear distortion. Recent research efforts on the problem have been thus concentrated on the modeling of lens distortion and its correction techniques. However, the types of lens distortion are various and the equations derived are more complicated if more precise model is employed for higher accuracy. In this paper methods for calibrating stereo vision systems with neural networks are described.

First, images with symmetry in the x and/or y directions and symmetry at centroid give zero values for odd orders of central moments. Secondly, they are very sensitive to noise, especially the higher order moments. This paper presents a single solution to solve the symmetrical problem and reduce the noise sensitivity of these moments. The solution involves a new set of moment-based features that uses a reference point other than the image centroid. The reference centre is selected such that the new moment features are invariant to translation, scaling and rotation. The derivation of the new moments and their invariance are shown before experimenting them with some symmetrical alphabets. Next, they are shown to be less sensitive under the presence of Gaussian and random noise as compared to the usual regular moment invariants. Noise corrupted English alphabets are classified with a neural network to further verify the advantage of using the new moment features.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/833525/","accessionNumber":"6589880","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-16 July 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Noise tolerant moments for neural network classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise tolerant moments for neural network classification","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00833525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036862S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"18002","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6674","citationCount":"4","articleId":"833525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":833526,"authors":[{"name":"Mingsheng Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Mingsheng Zhao","id":"37087559851"},{"name":"Youshou Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Youshou Wu","id":"37087250894"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5529-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7576"}],"articleNumber":"833526","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":25},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=833526","abstract":"This paper addresses a hybrid neural networks system, \"TsingNeu-1\", for large scale printed Chinese character recognition.

In the Spring of 1994, we conjectured that it might be possible to offer public access to a teleoperated robot via the WWW. As a feasibility study in 1994, we built a system that allows a robot manipulator to be teleoperated via the Internet. Although the field of teleoperation dates back over 50 years, HTTP provides a low-cost and widely available interface that can make teleoperated resources accessible to a broad range of users. The Mercury Project consisted of an industrial robot arm fitted with a CCD camera and a pneumatic system. We placed a sandbox filled with buried artifacts in the robot workspace. Novice users remotely moved the camera to view desired locations and directed short bursts of compressed air into the sand to view the newly cleared regions. To our knowledge, the Mercury Project was the first Internet robot. It was available almost continuously from August 1994 through March 1995 and was accessed by over 50,000 unique hosts. The article focuses on the interface design, robot hardware, and architecture of the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/833573/","volume":"7","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6567697","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Mercury Project: a feasibility study for Internet robots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Mercury Project: a feasibility study for Internet robots","sourcePdf":"00833573.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083694S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"100","citationCount":"79","articleId":"833573","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":833612,"authors":[{"name":"M.A.A.

While maintaining a globally cylindrical shape, the McKibben muscle produces a contraction force decreasing with its contraction ratio, as does skeletal muscle. The maximum force-to-weight ratio can be surprisingly high for a limited radial dimension and for a conventional pressure range. A 50 g McKibben muscle can easily develop more than 1000 N under 5 bar pressure for an external radius varying from about 1.5 to 3 cm. Thus, robotics specialists are interested in this well-adapted artificial muscle for motorizing powerful yet compact robot arms. The basic McKibben muscle static modeling developed in the paper, which is based on the three main parameters (i.e., initial braid angle, initial muscle length, and initial muscle radius) and includes a three-parameter friction model of the thread against itself, has shown its efficiency in both isometric and isotonic contraction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and control of McKibben artificial muscle robot actuators","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","doi":"10.1109/37.833638","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488303/18040/00833638.pdf","startPage":"15","endPage":"38","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.833638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18040","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=833638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/833638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2000","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and control of McKibben artificial muscle robot actuators","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6572935","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and control of McKibben artificial muscle robot actuators","sourcePdf":"00833638.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020221S","chronDate":"April  2000","isNumber":"18040","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"570","articleId":"833638","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":833666,"authors":[{"name":"Q.X.

The grey theory can be employed to improve the control performance of a system without sufficient information or with highly nonlinear property. In this paper, a grey prediction model combined with a proportional plus derivative controller is proposed to balance an inverted pendulum, which is a classic example of an inherently nonlinear unstable system. The control objective is to swing up the pendulum from a stable position to an unstable position and bring its slider back to the origin of the track. The overall control algorithm is decomposed into two separate grey model controllers for swinging up and balancing, respectively, based upon the angular and velocity values of the pendulum. The experimental results show that this grey model controller is able to swing up and balance the inverted pendulum and guide its slider to the center of the track. It also has the robustness to balance the inverted pendulum at an upright position in suffering an external impact acting on the pendulum.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.833761","doi":"10.1109/28.833761","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/18042/00833761.pdf","startPage":"452","endPage":"458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of an inverted pendulum using grey prediction model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control of an inverted pendulum using grey prediction model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/833761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 2000","accessionNumber":"6569623","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of an inverted pendulum using grey prediction model","sourcePdf":"00833761.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060281S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 2000","isNumber":"18042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"122","articleId":"833761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":833764,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In the first scheme, an attempt is made to control the rotor angular speed, utilizing a single three-hidden-layer network. The second scheme attempts to control the stator currents, using a predetermined control law as a function of the estimated states. This scheme incorporates three multilayered feedforward neural networks that the online trained, using the Levenburg-Marquadt training algorithm. The control of the direct and quadrature components of the stator current successfully tracked a wide variety of trajectories after relatively short online training periods. The control strategy adapts to the uncertainties of the motor/load dynamics and, in addition, learns their inherent nonlinearities.

The SRF controller is designed to achieve harmonic isolation at the dominant harmonic frequencies (such as at the 5th and/or 7th) between the supply and load. This allows implementation of the DHAF system by square-wave inverters switching at the 5th or 7th harmonic frequency. Compared to conventional active filter systems which require high-switching-frequency pulsewidth modulation inverters, the square-wave-inverter-based DHAF system provides a viable and cost-effective solution to achieve harmonic isolation for high-power nonlinear loads (10 MW and above) or cluster of nonlinear loads, to meet the IEEE 519 recommended harmonic standard. In this paper, a new feedforward command of the SRF controller is proposed which provides better dynamic performance. The improved feedforward command of the SRF controller can suppress any system resonances at the dominant harmonic frequencies and meet IEEE 519 harmonic current limits. Experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the SRF controller and the DHAF system.","doi":"10.1109/28.833775","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/18042/00833775.pdf","startPage":"567","endPage":"577","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.833775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental verification of dominant harmonic active filter for high-power applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/833775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 2000","displayDocTitle":"Experimental verification of dominant harmonic active filter for high-power applications","volume":"36","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6569637","publicationDate":"March-April 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental verification of dominant harmonic active filter for high-power applications","sourcePdf":"00833775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050215S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 2000","isNumber":"18042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"49","articleId":"833775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":833781,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The roll eccentricity may be caused by different reasons, e.g., inexact roll grinding or nonuniform thermal expansion of the rolls. The increasing demands on the thickness tolerances require new methods for the active compensation of the contribution of the roll eccentricity to the final thickness deviation. The presented method is based on the factorization approach over the set of stable transfer functions in combination with an adaptive least-mean-squares algorithm derived from the projection theorem. Here, the authors take advantage of the fact that the eccentricity-caused disturbance is periodic with a frequency proportional to the measured angular velocity of the rolls. Furthermore, it turns out that the presented concept fits the conventional control circuit of automatic gauge control in an optimal way. Simulation results for a cold rolling mill and measurement results for a hot strip mill demonstrate the feasibility and the excellent performance of the design.","doi":"10.1109/28.833781","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/18042/00833781.pdf","startPage":"625","endPage":"632","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.833781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18042","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=833781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active compensation of roll eccentricity in rolling mills","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/833781/","displayDocTitle":"Active compensation of roll eccentricity in rolling mills","volume":"36","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6569643","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active compensation of roll eccentricity in rolling mills","sourcePdf":"00833781.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056602S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 2000","isNumber":"18042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"30","articleId":"833781","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":833785,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Engineering design, construction of equipment enclosure, modifications with structural protection, and more recently, requirements for employee safe work practices have all targeted the risks of electrical arc hazards. Yet arcs accompanied by explosions continue to occur in electrical systems. Both human factors and equipment malfunctions contribute to the unexpected release of explosive electrical energy in the workplace. This paper presents experimental results of staged tests simulating the participation of workers in the test scene. Observations regarding the intensities of electrical arc flash events, variances between predicted and observed measurements, and implications for safety management are discussed.

The demonstration of high-brightness green-UV light-emitting diodes and laser diodes has established GaN as key materials for optoelectronics operating in the green-UV wavelength range. Despite the progress in the device developments, the basic properties of GaN are still poorly understood. Due to their high peak powers and short pulse widths, femtosecond optical pulses have become major tools for material characterization. We report on the characterization of GaN using femtosecond optical pulses. First, we have measured below bandgap nonlinear refractive index n/sub 2/ using Z-scan techniques. High n/sub 2/ value on the order of -10/sup -12/ cm/sup 2//W was measured, which indicates potential applications in all optical control and ultrafast optoelectronics. Second, we have measured two photon absorption coefficient (/spl beta//sub 2/) using pulsewidth autocorrelation. The measured /spl beta//sub 2/ is on the order of 3 cm/GW (for midgap wavelengths), which is higher than that of diamond and one order of magnitude larger than that of fused silica. The large two-photon absorption coefficients and broad band applicability make GaN and related materials excellent candidates as nonlinear crystals for IR-UV femtosecond pulsewidth measurements. Third, using femtosecond thermomodulation spectroscopy, we have studies the bandtail states in heavily n-typed doped GaN samples.","doi":"10.1109/CLEO.1999.833935","publicationTitle":"Technical Digest.

The retrieval of time-dependent intensity and phase of femtosecond laser pulses is a long standing problem. To date, frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) is probably the most trustworthy pulse measurement method. However, it requires a substantial experimental and numerical involvement. This motivates the quest for other simpler high-fidelity pulse measuring techniques. We present a new method of deciphering the pulse structure from the intensity autocorrelation trace and the intensity spectrum. We show that such a set of data is sufficient to restore the intensity and phase of a femtosecond pulse except for the typical uncertainties concerning the time shift and direction. The main feature of the proposed method is its robustness and swift convergence. Unlike a two-step pulse reconstruction, our algorithm employs the time- and frequency-domain data simultaneously, which in general provides a much faster convergence.","displayPublicationTitle":"Technical Digest.

Recently, there has been considerable research activity on optical code-division multiple access (CDMA) for local area network applications with systems based on coherent processing (manipulation of optical fields) holding the most promise. Coherent processing may be achieved using either incoherent (e.g., amplified spontaneous emission) or coherent (modelocked pulse) broadband optical sources, together with appropriate receiver structures. CDMA approaches using incoherent sources, such as coherence multiplexing and spectral amplitude coding, called incoherent broadband CDMA (INC-CDMA) offer the advantage of simpler technology. However, recent analyses have shown that INC-CDMA approaches are limited to throughputs of /spl sim/10-25 Gb/s. On the other hand, an analysis of ultrashort CDMA (US-CDMA) using spectral phase coding of coherent ultrashort pulses predicted that throughput could in principle exceed 100 Gb/s, although realization of the full potential of this scheme requires advanced femtosecond technology and is still a research challenge. We perform the first comparison of the theoretical bit-error-rate (BER) and throughput performance of INC-CDMA and US-CDMA for a common set of system parameters and explain the difference in predicted performance.","doi":"10.1109/CLEO.1999.834263","publicationTitle":"Technical Digest.

In this communication we describe the demonstration of Boolean XOR operation at 10 GHz using this device configured as a three input terminal all-optical gate. It is the first demonstration of two control beam switching with this device and is significant because it proves the ability of the gate to pass to the second interference fringe simply by introducing twice as much energy per pulse as is required for the first. Two control beam switching demonstration is important because it will allow the full complement of Boolean logic to be performed on ultra high speed optical signals.

The size of the switch is 16/spl times/16 and can handle the OC-12 (622 Mbps) link rate. Based on a bit-slice architecture, the entire 16/spl times/16 switch is implemented using four identical chips. The switch hits multiple paths, created by a randomizer in front of the routing stages between each input-output pair. The switch uses an input/output-buffering scheme and contains no buffers inside the fabric. A priority structure, which supports four levels, allows the delay sensitive ATM cells to be switched with the shortest latency. It also enables the noninterleaving routing scheme of IP cells. The switch fabric was designed and fabricated using MOSIS 0.8 /spl mu/m technology and was tested to run at 93 MHz with 3.3 V supply voltage.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18001","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835051","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000.

Placement quality is evaluated in terms of the half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) of hyperedges in the original circuit hypergraph provided timing constraints are met. Analytical placers are instrumental in handling non-linear timing models, but have two important drawbacks: (a) corresponding optimization algorithms are typically slower than top-down methods driven by multi-level mincut partitioning, and (b) hyperedges must be represented with net models which imply a mismatch of objective functions, with the alternative of computationally expensive linear programming (LP). By comparing to optimal solutions produced by linear programming, we show that net models lead to solution quality loss. To address this problem, we present the first analytical algorithm that does not require net models and permits a direct inclusion of non-linear delay terms; this allows to avoid expensive linearization of delay terms. Our numerical engine utilizes well-known quadratically convergent Newton-type methods for speed; it produces solutions within 12% of the LP optimum. Empirical results are for industrial placement instances.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835093","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000. Design Automation Conference. (IEEE Cat.

Congestion minimization is least understood, however, it models routability most accurately. In this paper, we study the congestion minimization problem during placement. First we point out that the bounding box router used previously is not an accurate measurement of the congestion in the placement. We use a realistic global router to evaluate congestion in the placement stage. This ensures that the final placement is truely congestion minimized. We also propose two new post processing algorithms, the flow-based cell-centric algorithm and the net-centric algorithm. While the flow-based cell-centric algorithm can move multiple cells at the same time to minimize the congestion, it suffers large consumption of memory. Experimental results show that the net-centric algorithm can effectively identify the congested spots in the placement and reduce the congestion. It can produce on an average 7.7% less congestion than the bounding box router method. Finally, we use a final global router to verify that the placement obtained from our algorithm has 39% less congestion than a wirelength-optimized placement obtained by TimberWolf (commercial version 1.3.1).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and minimization of routing congestion","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000.

Narrow data buses can he used to alleviate this problem at the cost of performance degradation due to wait cycles. In this paper, we address bus coding methods for low power core-based systems incorporating narrow buses. Although the conventional bus-invert code performs well for completely random patterns, we show that transition signaling combined with bus-invert, which we call BITS coding, can achieve much more power saving for data patterns of typical DSP applications. The application of BITS coding to a real circuit design is limited by the overhead of the encoder and decoder circuits and the extra bus line introduced. We propose an approximate version of BITS coding, which does not require the extra bus line while retaining the advantage of BITS coding.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835099","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000.

Computing the edge separability for a given edge e=(x, y) in an edge weighted undirected graph G(V, E, s, w) is equivalent to finding the x-y mincut. Then, we show that a simple and efficient algorithm CAPFOREST can be used to provide a good estimation of edge separability for all edges in G without using any network flow computation. Related experiments based on large scale ISPD98 benchmark circuits confirm that exploiting edge separability yields better quality partitioning solution compared to various bottom-up clustering algorithms proposed in the literature including Absorption, Density, Rent Parameter, Ratio Cut, Closeness, and Connectivity method.

With this mechanism, memory utilization rate can be improved to 100% and control noise can be suppressed. Moreover, the associated mask function, which is triggered while the CAM is full, can improve control performance. Comparison between CCMAC and a conventional CMAC is examined on the truck backer-upper control simulation.

To deal with this problem in an efficient way, a new technique is proposed based on the sequence pair structure and corner stitching. Performance gain is guaranteed at the cost of O(M) run-time complexity, which is optimal. Simulations with randomly generated problem instances show that practical run-times are indeed linear in the size of the problem instance, thus enabling other design optimization algorithms to incorporate the proposed method without increasing run-time complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000.

The exponentiation operation takes just 4 cycles in the proposed hardware while it takes about 100-200 cycles in conventional floating-point units.

The leading implementation, hMetis, has since 1997 proved itself substantially superior in both runtime and solution quality to even very recent work. In this work, we present two sets of results: (i) new techniques for flat FM-based hypergraph partitioning (which is the core of multilevel implementations), and (ii) a new multilevel implementation that offers leading-edge performance. Our new techniques for flat partitioning confirm the conjecture that specialized partitioning heuristics may be able to actively exploit fixed nodes in partitioning instances arising in the driving top-down placement context. Our FM variant is competitive with traditional FM on instances without terminals and considerably superior on instances with fixed nodes (i.e., arising during top-down placement). Our multilevel FM variant avoids several complex heuristics and non-trivial tunings that often lead to complex implementations; it achieves trade-offs between solution quality and run time that are comparable or better than those achieved by hMetis-1.5.3. We attempt to provide algorithm descriptions that are as detailed and unambiguous as possible, to allow replicability and speed improvements in future research.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2000.835182","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 2000.

That limits the simultaneous use of features derived from the speech signal with different processing algorithms. On the contrary artificial neural networks (ANN) are capable of incorporating multiple heterogeneous input features, which do not need to be treated as independent, finding the optimal combination of these features for classification. The purpose of this work is the exploitation of this characteristic of ANNs to improve the speech recognition accuracy through the combined use of input features coming from different sources (different feature extraction algorithms). We integrate two input sources: the Mel based cepstral coefficients (MFCC) derived from FFT and the RASTA-PLP cepstral coefficients. The results show that this integration leads to an error reduction of 26% on a telephone quality test set.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.835942","startPage":"2946","endPage":"2949 vol.5","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

For most pattern recognition applications, this condition should be satisfied. When this condition is satisfied, then an automatic feature extraction scheme can be derived using some N-dimension Euclidean geometry theories. The scheme will automatically extract the most distinguished parts of the pattern vectors used in the training. It selects the feature vectors automatically according to the descending order of the volumes of the parallelepiped spanned by these sub-vectors. Theoretical derivation and numerical examples revealing the physical nature of this process and its effect in optimizing the robustness of this novel pattern recognition system are reported in detail.

Many researchers have proposed methods to counteract this shortcoming, such as the noisy interpolation theory, hints, new distance measure (tangent distance), virtual examples, etc. This paper presents the idea of creating virtual negative examples as severe distortions of the known class patterns. Two classifiers are studied, a perceptron and a support vector machine trained to recognize objects in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. They utilize the training set (positive examples) to create the discriminant function of each class in the conventional way. On the other hand, the virtual negative examples will help determine the regions where the discriminant function should yield a low value. The experimental results show that incorporating the negative examples improves greatly (up to 50 percent improvement) the confuser rejection rates.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Neural engineering","Counting circuits","Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Image recognition","Synthetic aperture radar","Pattern classification","Testing","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synthetic aperture radar","image recognition","object recognition","perceptrons","learning by example"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ATR performance","virtual negative examples","example-based learning","noisy interpolation theory","distance measure","tangent distance","virtual examples","perceptron","support vector machine","object recognition","synthetic aperture radar images","SAR images","discriminant function","confuser rejection rates"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.836166","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

Furthermore, the classification performance of the network has been tested on other benchmark data sets, such as Fisher's iris data (1936) and a vowel data set.

Another advantage is that the RNN, after being trained, has a simple hardware realization that is ideal for implementation as a VLSI chip. The proposed decoder is tested on Hamming linear codes and the results are compared with that of the optimum soft decision decoder and the conventional hard decision decoder. Extensive simulations show that the RNN based decoder reduces the error probability to zero in the range of the error correcting capacity of the used code.

An abstract specification of the design is converted to a set of appropriate input vectors using a mathematical method, called \"multidimensional scaling\". These vectors which have, in general, higher dimensionality are fed to the self-organizing map at random in order to map them onto a 2D plane of the regular chip. The mapping is done in such a way that the cells with higher connectivity are placed close to each other, hence minimizing total connection length in the design. Two processes, called reassignment and rearrangement, are employed to make the algorithm applicable to the standard cell designs. In addition to the small examples introduced in other papers, two standard cell benchmarks were tried and better results were observed for these large designs compared to other neural net-barred approaches.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.836194","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

Thanks to such solution the average accuracy of the power consumption prediction for the power system may be greatly improved. The method based on self-organization is universal, flexible and easy for use in any power system.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.836209","startPage":"3401","endPage":"3404 vol.5","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

The correct prediction of branches is a fundamental factor for achieving high performance. Branch interference is a major contributor to the number of branches mispredicted by two-level predictors. Increasing the size of the pattern history table (PHT) reduces the interference, but the number of transistors that can be assigned to the PHT and the frequency at which it can be accessed limits the increase on its size. Another method for reducing interference is that of the gshare predictor. The gshare predictor combines the information used to generate the index into the PHT to increase its efficiency. In this paper, neural networks are used to discover a prediction algorithm to reduce interference and therefore increase the performance of two-level branch predictors. The neural net learns about the dynamics of programs to be executed in a microprocessor. A table of comparative performance with other established prediction methods is provided.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836213/","accessionNumber":"6597588","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-16 July 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using artificial neural networks to improve hardware branch predictors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using artificial neural networks to improve hardware branch predictors","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00836213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024836S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6674","citationCount":"1","articleId":"836213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":836215,"authors":[{"name":"Shuhui Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Shuhui Li","id":"37087160906"},{"name":"D.C.

Wind power can be influenced by many factors such as wind speeds, wind directions, terrain, air density, vertical wind profile, time of day, and seasons of the year. It is usually important to train a neural network with multiple influence factors and big training data set. We have parallelized the extended Kalman filter (EKF) training algorithm, which can provide fast training even for large training data sets. The MLP network is then trained with the consideration of various possible factors, which can influence turbine power production. The performance of the trained network is studied from the point of view of information presented to the network through network inputs regarding different affecting factors and large training data set covering all the seasons of a year.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.836215","startPage":"3430","endPage":"3434 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

Facial expressions can be described by combining different action units that are used for describing the basic muscle movement of a human face. We choose six main action units, being composed of facial characteristic points movements, as the input vectors for two different neural network-based expression classifiers including radial basis function network and multilayer perceptron network.

For the imagery versus baseline pairing, discrimination was good in three subjects, marginal in two and not possible in the other two. For the imagery versus maths pairing, discrimination was very good in two subjects, good in 4 and marginal in one. The data was analysed using lagged-AR feature vectors and a Bayesian logistic regression classifier with temporal smoothing. Enhanced spectra are shown highlighting differential spectral activity for each task pairing. The results suggest that combinations of different task pairings and dynamic neural network models have the potential to drastically reduce the time it takes for a new user to learn to use an EEG-based computer interface.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.836248","startPage":"3586","endPage":"3590 vol.5","publicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

Harmonic generators are able to reproduce accurately sine trajectories for long periods of time without using any external inputs, Our network called the hybrid-complex neural network was able to represent some of the dynamics of the system, showing fairly good short-term prediction and some oscillation during the long-term prediction, even when the external inputs came from previous predictions of the network.

Hydroxyurea is an orally delivered medication that partially alleviates the symptoms of sickle cell anemia. The studies described were undertaken to develop the ability to identify those patients who will not benefit sufficiently from hydroxyurea to warrant the risk of its deleterious side effects by the use of neural networks. The trained artificial neural networks were capable of predicting the potential response of a patient to hydroxyurea with 86% and as high as 100% accuracy, depending on the definition of a positive response. This prediction was achieved by training the network with the 23 collected parameters. Furthermore, if was possible to reduce the 23 input dimensional space into only 8 by performing variable selection.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.1999.836271","startPage":"3694","endPage":"3697 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"IJCNN'99.

paper considers the problem of structure and motion estimation in multiview teleconferencing-type sequences and its application for video-sequence compression and intermediate-view generation. First, we introduce a new approach for structure estimation from a stereo pair acquired by two parallel cameras. It is based on a 2-D mesh representation of both views of the imaged scene and a parametrization of the structure information by the disparity between corresponding nodes in the image pair. Next, we describe a novel image alignment approach which can convert images captured using nonparallel cameras to coplanar-like images. This approach greatly eases the computational burden incurred by the nonparallel camera geometry, where one must consider both horizontal and vertical disparities. Finally, we present a coder for multiview sequences, which exploits the proposed alignment and structure estimation algorithm. By extracting the foreground objects and estimating the disparity field between a selected view and a reference view the coder can compress the image pair very efficiently. In the meantime, by using the coded structure information, the decoder can generate virtual viewpoints between decoded views, which can be very helpful for telepresence applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836284/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6587951","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Multiview video sequence analysis, compression, and virtual viewpoint synthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiview video sequence analysis, compression, and virtual viewpoint synthesis","sourcePdf":"00836284.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055533S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"18066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"75","articleId":"836284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":836286,"authors":[{"name":"Chok-Kwan Cheung","affiliation":["University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Chok-Kwan Cheung","id":"37611130600"},{"name":"Lai-Man Po","affiliation":["University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Lai-Man Po","id":"37270836200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"836286","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":127,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":346},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=836286","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Computational complexity","Distortion measurement","Mean square error methods","ISO standards","Redundancy","Image processing","Video sequences","Electron traps","Vector quantization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video signal processing","image sequences","image matching","search problems","motion estimation","computational complexity","mean square error methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["normalized partial distortion search algorithm","block motion estimation","fast block-matching algorithms","high computation reduction","matching error","full-search algorithm","fast block-matching algorithm","halfway-stop technique","block distortion measure","early rejection probability","motion vectors","minimum distortion","experimental results","mean square error performance","video coding","video sequences","computational complexity reduction","digital video applications"]}],"abstract":"Many fast block-matching algorithms reduce computations by limiting the number of checking points.

The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides acceptable performance both subjectively and objectively at various bit error rates and burst lengths.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchical synchronization technique based on the EREC for robust transmission of H.263 bit stream","doi":"10.1109/76.836289","startPage":"433","endPage":"438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.836289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/18066/00836289.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=836289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical synchronization technique based on the EREC for robust transmission of H.263 bit stream","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6587956","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical synchronization technique based on the EREC for robust transmission of H.263 bit stream","sourcePdf":"00836289.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048803S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"18066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"7","articleId":"836289","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":836290,"authors":[{"name":"Tian-Sheuan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tian-Sheuan Chang","id":"37085982347"},{"name":"Chin-Sheng Kung","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Sheng Kung","id":"37087481507"},{"name":"Chein-Wei Jen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chein-Wei Jen","id":"37086997501"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"836290","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":432},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Process design","Discrete cosine transforms","Hardware","Costs","CMOS technology","Discrete transforms","Digital cameras","Algorithm design and analysis","Arithmetic","Distributed computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","CMOS digital integrated circuits","video coding","digital signal processing chips","video codecs","distributed arithmetic","image colour analysis","inverse problems","cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["processor core design","discrete cosine transform","indiscrete cosine transform","H.263","digital camera","fast direct 2D DCT algorithm","bit level adder-based distributed arithmetic","hardware cost reduction","computing speed","throughput rate","SPDM CMOS technology","gate count","real-time DCT/IDCT","H.263 codec system","QCIF image frame size","4:2:0 color format","video data compression","inverse DCT","33 MHz","0.6 micron"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a cost-effective processor core design that features the simplest hardware and is suitable for discrete cosine transform/indiscrete cosine transform (DCT/IDCT) operations in H.263 and digital camera.

The proposed zerotree wavelet vector quantization (WVQ) algorithm focuses on the problem of how to reduce the computation time to encode wavelet images with high coding efficiency. A conventional wavelet image-compression algorithm exploits the tree structure of wavelet coefficients coupled with scalar quantization. However, they can not provide the real-time computation because they use iterative methods to decide zerotrees. In contrast, the zerotree WVQ algorithm predicts in real-time zero-vector trees of insignificant wavelet vectors by a noniterative decision rule and then encodes significant wavelet vectors by the classified VQ. These cause the zerotree WVQ algorithm to provide the best compromise between the coding performance and the computation time. The noniterative decision rule was extracted by the simulation results. Moreover, the zerotree WVQ exploits the multistage VQ to encode the lowest frequency subband, which is generally known to be robust to wireless channel errors. The proposed WVQ VLSI architecture has only one VQ module to execute in real-time the proposed zerotree WVQ algorithm by utilizing the vacant cycles for zero-vector trees which are not transmitted. And the VQ module has only L+1 processing elements (PEs) for the real-time minimum distance calculation, where the codebook size is L. L PEs are for Euclidean distance calculation and a PE is for parallel distance comparison.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/18066/00836293.pdf","startPage":"475","endPage":"489","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.836293","doi":"10.1109/76.836293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time wavelet vector quantization algorithm and its VLSI architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","displayDocTitle":"A real-time wavelet vector quantization algorithm and its VLSI architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836293/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6587960","volume":"10","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time wavelet vector quantization algorithm and its VLSI architecture","sourcePdf":"00836293.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050491S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"18066","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"10","articleId":"836293","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":836307,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

In this paper, a new version of the direct current (dc) electromagnetic induction system is introduced in which a sensor system, based on the dc electromagnetic induction instrument, is coupled with an updated data acquisition system. Unlike the conventional dc induction instrument, the new system can achieve a full-signature logging response by providing all the measured flux leakage (FL) signals and eddy current (EC) signals to the computer logging system (CLS) on the surface. To transmit the information represented by large amounts of data acquired by downhole instruments to the CLS on the surface, a wavelet data compression technique has been incorporated. A VLSI integrated circuit (IC) which realizes the wavelet transform has been designed so that the real-time mode can be achieved during the logging operation. The circuit has been designed using CMOS n-well 2-/spl mu/m technology and has been fabricated by MOSIS.","doi":"10.1109/19.836321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.836321","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/18068/00836321.pdf","startPage":"120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-signature real-time corrosion detection of underground casing pipes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836321/","displayDocTitle":"Full-signature real-time corrosion detection of underground casing pipes","volume":"49","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"6579718","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-signature real-time corrosion detection of underground casing pipes","sourcePdf":"00836321.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053211S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18068","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"13","articleId":"836321","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":836324,"authors":[{"name":"G.

By paralleling two SC cells, the converter input current becomes continuous, resulting in much reduced conducted electromagnetic interference with other circuits fed by the same power supply.

Simulated and experimental results obtained from the proposed circuit with an FLC have verified the adaptivity, robustness and feasibility.","doi":"10.1109/41.836344","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/18065/00836344.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.836344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy-logic-controlled single-stage converter for PV-powered lighting system applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=836344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836344/","displayDocTitle":"A fuzzy-logic-controlled single-stage converter for PV-powered lighting system applications","volume":"47","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6573367","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fuzzy-logic-controlled single-stage converter for PV-powered lighting system applications","sourcePdf":"00836344.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052481S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"18065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"130","articleId":"836344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":836351,"authors":[{"name":"Faa-Jeng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Faa-Jeng Lin","id":"37272521300"},{"name":"Rong-Jong Wai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan","Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Rong-Jong Wai","id":"37271527600"},{"name":"Chih-Hong Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Hong Lin","id":"37278406300"},{"name":"Da-Chung Liu","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Company, Chungli, Taiwan","Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Da-Chung Liu","id":"37438829000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"836351","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":483},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stators","Induction motor drives","Rotors","Robust control","Torque control","Adaptive systems","Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Uncertainty","Velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","machine vector control","stators","control system synthesis","machine theory","fuzzy neural nets","observers","robust control","velocity control","control system analysis","two-term control","fuzzy control","neurocontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drive","fuzzy neural network uncertainty observer","decoupled stator-flux-oriented control","control design","online rotor time-constant estimation","robust speed controller","model reference adaptive system","energy function","rotor time-constant","control simulation","integral-proportional speed controller","control performance"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupled stator-flux-oriented induction motor drive with fuzzy neural network uncertainty observer","doi":"10.1109/41.836351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18065","endPage":"367","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/18065/00836351.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.836351","startPage":"356","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=836351","abstract":"A stator-flux-oriented induction motor drive using online rotor time-constant estimation with a robust speed controller is introduced in this paper.

It is based on a recursive least-squares estimator deducing both position and speed.

Experimental results for a 12/8 motor demonstrate that estimation is possible over the full range of operating conditions, including the field-weakening region, with a typical accuracy of better than two mechanical degrees. The paper also illustrates the performance of the algorithm by showing it operating within a sensorless position controller.","doi":"10.1109/41.836352","startPage":"368","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/18065/00836352.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.836352","endPage":"379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rotor position estimation in a switched reluctance drive using recursive least squares","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","displayDocTitle":"Rotor position estimation in a switched reluctance drive using recursive least squares","volume":"47","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6573375","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotor position estimation in a switched reluctance drive using recursive least squares","sourcePdf":"00836352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040179S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"18065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"26","articleId":"836352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":836356,"authors":[{"name":"Seul Jung","affiliation":["Robotics and Computational Intelligence Laboratory, Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Chungnam National University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seul Jung","id":"37087156929"},{"name":"T.C.

In order to improve that result, a new impedance function is derived which specifies a desired force directly.

The proposed neural force control scheme is capable of making the robot track a specified desired force as well as of compensating for uncertainties in environment location and stiffness, and in robot dynamics. Separate training signals for free-space motion and contact-space motion control are developed to train the neural compensator online. The design of the training signals is justified.

It is difficult to establish an appropriate mathematical model for the design of a model-based controller. Although fuzzy logic control has a model-free feature, it still needs time-consuming work for the rules bank and fuzzy parameters adjustment. In this paper, a stable self-organizing fuzzy controller (SOFC) is proposed to manipulate the motion trajectory of a 5-degrees-of-freedom robot. This approach has a learning ability for responding to the time-varying characteristic of a robot. Its control rules bank can be established and modified continuously by online learning with zero initial fuzzy rules. In addition, this control strategy has effectively improved the stability problem of a previous SOFC. The experimental results show that this intelligent controller has a stable learning ability and good motion control capability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836358/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6573381","volume":"47","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A stable self-organizing fuzzy controller for robotic motion control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stable self-organizing fuzzy controller for robotic motion control","sourcePdf":"00836358.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031796S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"18065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"79","articleId":"836358","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":836362,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.

The use of neural networks is proposed, to learn the empirical or experimental design information that already exists, and then to predict the occurrence of burning events and the voltage endurance of new PTC devices at the design/development stage. Two predictive schemes are presented separately, for burning events and for voltage endurance, where the training patterns for the desired outputs are either generated from empirical formulae or collected from experiments on already-developed PTC devices.

This paper presents a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the automatic detection of clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammograms. The proposed system consists of two main steps. First, potential microcalcification pixels in the mammograms are segmented out by using mixed features consisting of wavelet features and gray level statistical features, and labeled into potential individual microcalcification objects by their spatial connectivity. Second, individual microcalcifications are detected by using a set of 31 features extracted from the potential individual microcalcification objects. The discriminatory power of these features is analyzed using general regression neural networks via sequential forward and sequential backward selection methods. The classifiers used in these two steps are both multilayer feedforward neural networks. The method is applied to a database of 40 mammograms (Nijmegen database) containing 105 clusters of microcalcifications. A free-response operating characteristics (FROC) curve is used to evaluate the performance. Results show that the proposed system gives quite satisfactory detection performance. In particular, a 90% mean true positive detection rate is achieved at the cost of 0.5 false positive per image when mixed features are used in the first step and 15 features selected by the sequential backward selection method are used in the second step. However, one must be cautious when interpreting the results, since the 20 training samples are also used in the testing step.","doi":"10.1109/42.836371","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/18064/00836371.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.836371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CAD system for the automatic detection of clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammogram films","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","displayDocTitle":"A CAD system for the automatic detection of clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammogram films","volume":"19","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6578543","pubMedId":"10784283","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CAD system for the automatic detection of clustered microcalcifications in digitized mammogram films","sourcePdf":"00836371.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066725S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"18064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"191","articleId":"836371","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":836372,"authors":[{"name":"Quan Liang","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden"],"lastName":"Quan Liang","id":"37362694000"},{"name":"I.

The drawbacks of this method are the interobserver variability and inefficiency. Here, the authors present a new automated method which reduces these problems. By applying a multiscale dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, approximate vessel wall positions are first estimated in a coarse-scale image, which then guide the detection of the boundaries in a fine-scale image. In both cases, DP is used for finding a global optimum for a cost function. The cost function is a weighted sum of terms, in fuzzy expression forms, representing image features and geometrical characteristics of the vessel interfaces. The weights are adjusted by a training procedure using human expert tracings. Operator interventions, if needed, also take effect under the framework of global optimality. This reduces the amount of human intervention and, hence, variability due to subjectiveness. By incorporating human knowledge and experience, the algorithm becomes more robust. A thorough evaluation of the method in the clinical environment shows that interobserver variability is evidently decreased and so is the overall analysis time. The authors conclude that the automated procedure can replace the manual procedure and leads to an improved performance.","doi":"10.1109/42.836372","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/18064/00836372.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.836372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18064","startPage":"127","endPage":"142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multiscale dynamic programming procedure for boundary detection in ultrasonic artery images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=836372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A multiscale dynamic programming procedure for boundary detection in ultrasonic artery images","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836372/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6578544","pubMedId":"10784284","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multiscale dynamic programming procedure for boundary detection in ultrasonic artery images","sourcePdf":"00836372.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040689S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"18064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"238","articleId":"836372","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":836373,"authors":[{"name":"L.G.

Unlike in other modalities, such as X-ray computerized tomography, MR images taken for the same patient on the same scanner at different times may appear different from each other due to a variety of scanner-dependent variations and, therefore, the absolute intensity values do not have a fixed meaning. The authors have devised a two-step method wherein all images (independent of patients and the specific brand of the MR scanner used) can be transformed in such a may that for the same protocol and body region, in the transformed images similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. Standardized images can be displayed with fixed windows without the need of per-case adjustment. More importantly, extraction of quantitative information about healthy organs or about abnormalities can be considerably simplified. This paper introduces and compares new variants of this standardizing method that can help to overcome some of the problems with the original method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New variants of a method of MRI scale standardization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/42.836373","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/18064/00836373.pdf","startPage":"143","endPage":"150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.836373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=836373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836373/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2000","displayDocTitle":"New variants of a method of MRI scale standardization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6578545","pubMedId":"10784285","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New variants of a method of MRI scale standardization","sourcePdf":"00836373.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022253S","chronDate":"Feb.  2000","isNumber":"18064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"495","articleId":"836373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":836375,"authors":[{"name":"Shyi-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shyi-Ming Chen","id":"37087168230"},{"name":"Jeng-Ren Hwang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jeng-Ren Hwang","id":"37087768229"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"836375","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":252,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1318},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature","Weather forecasting","Predictive models","Economic forecasting","Prediction algorithms","Casting","Storms","Typhoons","Stock markets","Fuzzy sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time series","forecasting theory","fuzzy set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy time series","forecasting methods","time series","two-factors","time-variant","temperature prediction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=836375","abstract":"A drawback of traditional forecasting methods is that they can not deal with forecasting problems in which the historical data are represented by linguistic values.

The TDGAR learning scheme is a new hybrid GA, which integrates the TD prediction method and the GA to perform the reinforcement learning task. The TDGAR learning system is composed of two integrated feedforward networks. One neural network acts as a critic network to guide the learning of the other network (the action network) which determines the outputs (actions) of the TDGAR learning system. The action network can be a normal neural network or a neural fuzzy network. Using the TD prediction method, the critic network can predict the external reinforcement signal and provide a more informative internal reinforcement signal to the action network. The action network uses the GA to adapt itself according to the internal reinforcement signal. The key concept of the TDGAR learning scheme is to formulate the internal reinforcement signal as the fitness function for the GA such that the GA can evaluate the candidate solutions (chromosomes) regularly, even during periods without external feedback from the environment. This enables the GA to proceed to new generations regularly without waiting for the arrival of the external reinforcement signal. This can usually accelerate the GA learning since a reinforcement signal may only be available at a time long after a sequence of actions has occurred in the reinforcement learning problem. The proposed TDGAR learning system has been used to control an active magnetic bearing (AMB) system in practice. A systematic design procedure is developed to achieve successful integration of all the subsystems including magnetic suspension, mechanical structure, and controller training. The results show that the TDGAR learning scheme can successfully find a neural controller or a neural fuzzy controller for a self-designed magnetic bearing system.","doi":"10.1109/3477.836376","startPage":"276","endPage":"289","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/18067/00836376.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.836376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GA-based fuzzy reinforcement learning for control of a magnetic bearing system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Magnetic levitation","Control systems","Learning systems","Prediction methods","Neural networks","Genetics","Fuzzy neural networks","Biological cells","Signal generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neurocontrollers","magnetic bearings","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy reinforcement learning","magnetic bearing system","temporal difference","GA","genetic algorithm","learning method","neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836376/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2000","displayDocTitle":"GA-based fuzzy reinforcement learning for control of a magnetic bearing system","volume":"30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6578764","pubMedId":"18244754","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GA-based fuzzy reinforcement learning for control of a magnetic bearing system","sourcePdf":"00836376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040526S","chronDate":"April  2000","isNumber":"18067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"44","articleId":"836376","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":836377,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Feng Juang","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, Private Chung-Chou Junior College of Technology and Commerce, Changhua, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chia-Feng Juang","id":"37087172575"},{"name":"Jiann-Yow Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jiann-Yow Lin","id":"37087257436"},{"name":"Chin-Teng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chin-Teng Lin","id":"37085971736"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"836377","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":157,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":566},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Learning","Symbiosis","Fuzzy control","Design methodology","Fuzzy sets","Algorithm design and analysis","Temperature control","Genetic algorithms","Differential equations","Input variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","magnetic levitation","fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reinforcement learning","symbiotic evolution","fuzzy controller design","genetic reinforcement learning","fuzzy controllers","simulated control problems"]}],"abstract":"An efficient genetic reinforcement learning algorithm for designing fuzzy controllers is proposed in this paper. The genetic algorithm (GA) adopted in this paper is based upon symbiotic evolution which, when applied to fuzzy controller design, complements the local mapping property of a fuzzy rule. Using this Symbiotic-Evolution-based Fuzzy Controller (SEFC) design method, the number of control trials, as well as consumed CPU time, are considerably reduced when compared to traditional GA-based fuzzy controller design methods and other types of genetic reinforcement learning schemes. Moreover, unlike traditional fuzzy controllers, which partition the input space into a grid, SEFC partitions the input space in a flexible way, thus creating fewer fuzzy rules. In SEFC, different types of fuzzy rules whose consequent parts are singletons, fuzzy sets, or linear equations (TSK-type fuzzy rules) are allowed. Further, the free parameters (e.g., centers and widths of membership functions) and fuzzy rules are all tuned automatically. For the TSK-type fuzzy rule especially, which put the proposed learning algorithm in use, only the significant input variables are selected to participate in the consequent of a rule. The proposed SEFC design method has been applied to different simulated control problems, including the cart-pole balancing system, a magnetic levitation system, and a water bath temperature control system. The proposed SEFC has been verified to be efficient and superior from these control problems, and from comparisons with some traditional GA-based fuzzy systems.","doi":"10.1109/3477.836377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/18067/00836377.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.836377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic reinforcement learning through symbiotic evolution for fuzzy controller design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=836377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836377/","displayDocTitle":"Genetic reinforcement learning through symbiotic evolution for fuzzy controller design","volume":"30","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6584702","pubMedId":"18244755","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic reinforcement learning through symbiotic evolution for fuzzy controller design","sourcePdf":"00836377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037552S","chronDate":"April  2000","isNumber":"18067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"157","articleId":"836377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":836378,"authors":[{"name":"Byung-Jae Choi","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Communication Engineering, Taegu University, Kyungbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byung-Jae Choi","id":"37087298332"},{"name":"Seong-Woo Kwak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seong-Woo Kwak","id":"37087395677"},{"name":"Byung Kook Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byung Kook Kim","id":"37087151321"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"836378","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":121,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":840},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=836378","abstract":"In existing fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs), input variables are mostly the error and the change-of-error regardless of complexity of controlled plants. Either control input u or the change of control input /spl Delta/u is commonly used as its output variable. A rule table is then constructed on a two-dimensional (2-D) space. This scheme naturally inherits from conventional proportional-derivative (PD) or proportional-integral (PI) controller. Observing that 1) rule tables of most FLCs have skew-symmetric property and 2) the absolute magnitude of the control input |u| or |/spl Delta/u| is proportional to the distance from its main diagonal line in the normalized input space, we derive a new variable called the signed distance, which is used as a sole fuzzy input variable in our simple FLC called single-input FLC (SFLC). The SFLC has many advantages: The total number of rules is greatly reduced compared to existing FLCs, and hence, generation and tuning of control rules are much easier. The proposed SFLC is proven to be absolutely stable using Popov criterion. Furthermore, the control performance is nearly the same as that of existing FLCs, which is revealed via computer simulations using two nonlinear plants.","doi":"10.1109/3477.836378","startPage":"303","endPage":"309","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/18067/00836378.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.836378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and stability analysis of single-input fuzzy logic controller","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Fuzzy logic","Input variables","Proportional control","Error correction","Two dimensional displays","Two-term control","PD control","Pi control","Fuzzy control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Popov criterion","absolute stability","fuzzy control","control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability analysis","fuzzy logic controller","FLC","absolute stability","fuzzy control logic","Lure-type Lyanupov function","signed distance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836378/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2000","displayDocTitle":"Design and stability analysis of single-input fuzzy logic controller","volume":"30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6578765","pubMedId":"18244756","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and stability analysis of single-input fuzzy logic controller","sourcePdf":"00836378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025591S","chronDate":"April  2000","isNumber":"18067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"121","articleId":"836378","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":836379,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Chang Hwang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Ming-Chang Hwang","id":"37087769040"},{"name":"Xiheng Hu","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical Engineering, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Xiheng Hu","id":"37087158970"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"836379","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=836379","abstract":"A new robust learning controller for simultaneous position and force control of uncertain constrained manipulators is presented. Using models of the manipulator dynamics and environmental constraint, a task-space reduced-order position dynamics and an algebraic description for the interacting force between the manipulator and its environment are constructed. Based on this treatment, the robust nonlinear H/spl infin/ control approach and direct adaptive neural network (NN) technique are then integrated together. The role of NN devices is to adaptively learn those manipulators' structured/unstructured uncertain dynamics as well as the uncertainties with environmental modelling. Then, the effects on tracking performance attributable to the approximation errors of NN devices are attenuated to a prescribed level by the embedded nonlinear H/spl infin/ control. Whenever the adopted NN devices have the potential to effectively approximate those nonlinear mappings which are to be learned, then this new control scheme can be ultimately less conservative than its counterpart H/spl infin/ only position/force tracking control scheme. This is shown analytically in the form of theorem. Finally, a simulation study for a constrained two-link planar manipulator is given. Simulation results indicate that the proposed adaptive H/spl infin/ NN position/force tracking controller performs better in both force and position tracking tasks than its counterpart H/spl infin/ only position/force tracking control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/3477.836379","startPage":"310","endPage":"321","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/18067/00836379.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.836379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust position/force learning controller of manipulators via nonlinear H/spl infin/ control and neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force control","Robust control","Manipulator dynamics","Neural networks","Motion control","Uncertainty","Orbital robotics","Robotic assembly","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force control","position control","manipulators","learning (artificial intelligence)","H/sup /spl infin control","neurocontrollers","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["position/force learning controller","manipulators","nonlinear H/spl infin/ control","neural networks","robust learning controller","constrained manipulators","tracking control","position tracking","force tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836379/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2000","displayDocTitle":"A robust position/force learning controller of manipulators via nonlinear H/spl infin/ control and neural networks","volume":"30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6578766","pubMedId":"18244757","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust position/force learning controller of manipulators via nonlinear H/spl infin/ control and neural networks","sourcePdf":"00836379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043567S","chronDate":"April  2000","isNumber":"18067","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"29","articleId":"836379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":836384,"authors":[{"name":"Shiqian Wu","affiliation":["Intelligent Machines Research Laboratory, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Shiqian Wu","id":"37087155260"},{"name":"Meng Joo Er","affiliation":["Intelligent Machines Research Laboratory, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"lastName":"Meng Joo Er","id":"37087070396"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"836384","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":295,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1178},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Neural networks","Function approximation","Fuzzy systems","Neurons","Recruitment","Modeling","Fuzzy logic","Backpropagation algorithms","Erbium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy logic","learning (artificial intelligence)","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic fuzzy neural networks","function approximation","Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy systems","extended radial basis function neural networks","learning algorithm","hierarchical on-line self-organizing learning","neurons"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an architecture of dynamic fuzzy neural networks (D-FNN) implementing Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems based on extended radial basis function (RBF) neural networks is proposed.

A typical FPGA consists of an array of configurable logic blocks and a mesh of interconnections fully programmable by the user to perform a given application. By just changing its internal connectivity, the FPGA can implement a totally different new function. However in most of the applications, the FPGA is configured only once and used as coprocessor to carry out some highly complex or time-consuming computation. The reason for such limitation is the small communication bandwidth between the FPGA chip and the external memory, usually ROM, where the configuration data is stored. The Optically Programmable Gate Array (OPGA), an enhanced version of a conventional FPGA, can overcome this problem. The OPGA utilizes a holographic memory accessed by an array of VCSELs to program its logic. The on-chip logic has been complemented with an array of photodetectors to detect the configuration template recorded in the memory. Combining spatial and shift multiplexing to store the configuration pages in the memory, the OPGA module is very compact and has extremely short configuration time allowing for dynamic reconfiguration. The reconfiguration capability of the OPGA can be applied to solve more efficiently problems in pattern recognition and digit classification.","doi":"10.1109/SSMSD.2000.836438","publicationTitle":"2000 Southwest Symposium on Mixed-Signal Design (Cat.

As a result, securing group communications, i.e., providing confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of messages delivered between group members, will become a critical networking issue. We present, in this paper, a novel solution to the scalability problem of group/multicast key management. We formalize the notion of a secure group as a triple (U,K,R) where U denotes a set of users, K a set of keys held by the users, and R a user-key relation. We then introduce key graphs to specify secure groups. For a special class of key graphs, we present three strategies for securely distributing rekey messages after a join/leave and specify protocols for joining and leaving a secure group. The rekeying strategies and join/leave protocols are implemented in a prototype key server we have built. We present measurement results from experiments and discuss performance comparisons. We show that our group key management service, using any of the three rekeying strategies, is scalable to large groups with frequent joins and leaves. In particular, the average measured processing time per join/leave increases linearly with the logarithm of group size.","doi":"10.1109/90.836475","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/18071/00836475.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.836475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure group communications using key graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=836475","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836475/","displayDocTitle":"Secure group communications using key graphs","volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6581352","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure group communications using key graphs","sourcePdf":"00836475.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038047S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"680","articleId":"836475","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":836476,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Adaptive means that the number of nodes that transmit to the multicast group is continuously changing. In order to meet deterministic quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of a real-time group multicast, some communication resources are reserved. We show (1) how bandwidth is reserved for each multicast group and (2) how an active source can dynamically share the bandwidth allocated to this multicast group with other active group members. Quality-of-service support for a real-time multicast group is based on time-driven priority. In this scheme the time is divided into time frames of fixed duration, and all the time frames are aligned by using a common global time reference, which can be obtained from the Global Positioning System. Bandwidth is allocated to a multicast group as a whole, rather than individually to each user. The allocation is done by reserving time intervals within time frames in a periodic fashion. This type of allocation raises two problems that are studied in this paper: (1) scheduling: how time intervals are reserved to each multicast group and (2) adaptive sharing: how the active (transmitting) participants can dynamically share the time intervals that have been reserved for their multicast group. The proposed approach is based on the embedding of multiple virtual rings, one for each multicast group. By using the virtual rings, it is simple to route messages to all the participants while minimizing the bound on the buffer sizes and queueing delays. The final part of this paper introduces a scalable growth of the multicast group by adding multiple subtrees to the virtual ring.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","volume":"8","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6581353","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive group multicast with time-driven priority","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive group multicast with time-driven priority","sourcePdf":"00836476.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044134S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"16","articleId":"836476","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":836477,"authors":[{"name":"Sunghyun Choi","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","Briarcliff Manor, Philips Research, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Sunghyun Choi","id":"37279913300"},{"name":"K.G.

With D-TDD, a frequency channel is time-shared for both downlink and uplink transmissions under the dynamic access control of the base station. The base station (1) handles uplink transmissions by polling mobiles in a certain order determined on a per-connection (per-message) basis for transmitting real-time (non-real-time) traffic from mobiles and (2) schedules the transmission of downlink packets. To handle location-dependent, time-varying, and bursty errors, we adopt the channel-state prediction, transmission deferment, and retransmission. We consider the problems of scheduling and multiplexing downlink packet transmissions, and polling mobiles for uplink transmissions depending on the channel state. We also establish conditions necessary to admit each new real-time connection by checking if the connection's delivery-delay bound can be guaranteed as long as the channel stays in good condition without compromising any of the existing guarantees. Last, the performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated to demonstrate how the protocol works and to study the effects of various parameters of the protocol.","doi":"10.1109/90.836477","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/18071/00836477.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.836477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18071","startPage":"44","endPage":"59","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified wireless LAN architecture for real-time and non-real-time communication services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=836477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A unified wireless LAN architecture for real-time and non-real-time communication services","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/836477/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6581354","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified wireless LAN architecture for real-time and non-real-time communication services","sourcePdf":"00836477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04347S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"53","articleId":"836477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":836785,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For example, off-chip memory may require clocking and this can reduce the benefits of self-timed design. This paper presents the design of a delay line which may be used to control the timing of an off-chip interface. Timing accuracy is maintained by periodically recalibrating against a low frequency reference clock. The design uses two delay lines so that one can be recalibrated while the other is in use. Recalibration is undertaken once each second; power consumption is low as the calibration circuitry is dormant most of the time. A particular implementation of the design is presented which is suitable for a standard cell or FPGA technology together with experimental performance figures. The paper concludes with some remarks about possible applications in low-power synchronous design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An on-chip dynamically recalibrated delay line for embedded self-timed systems","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Symposium on Advanced Research in Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (ASYNC 2000) (Cat.

One solution to these problems, which we advance in this paper, is to stick to a conventional design flow as closely as possible and to use commercial design tools as much as possible. The paper considers a particular subclass of asynchronous circuits (Null Convention Logic or NCL) and suggests a design flow which is completely based on commercial CAD tools. It argues about the trade-off between the simplicity of design flow and the quality of obtained implementations.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Symposium on Advanced Research in Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (ASYNC 2000) (Cat.

While most existing FIFO's trade higher throughput for higher latency, our goal is to achieve very low latency while maintaining good throughput. The designs are implemented as circular arrays of cells connected to common data buses. Data items are not moved around the array once they are enqueued. Each cell's input and output behavior is dictated by the flow of two tokens around the ring: one that allows enqueuing data and one that allows dequeuing data. Two novel protocols are introduced with various degrees of parallelism, as well as four different implementations. The best simulation results, in 0.6 /spl mu/, have a latency of 1.73 ns and throughput of 454 MegaOperations/second for a 4-place FIFO.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASYNC.2000.837024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18072","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Symposium on Advanced Research in Asynchronous Circuits and Systems (ASYNC 2000) (Cat.

The results are also extended to the case of non-i.i.d. diversity paths.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An MGF-based performance analysis of generalized selection combining over Rayleigh fading channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.837044","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/18093/00837044.pdf","startPage":"401","endPage":"415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.837044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=837044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/837044/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"An MGF-based performance analysis of generalized selection combining over Rayleigh fading channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6562639","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An MGF-based performance analysis of generalized selection combining over Rayleigh fading channels","sourcePdf":"00837044.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047481S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"357","articleId":"837044","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":837045,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These statistics are natural in this setting as they characterize the shape of the distribution of the noisy baseband I and Q samples. It is shown that cumulant-based classification is particularly effective when used in a hierarchical scheme, enabling separation into subclasses at low signal-to-noise ratio with small sample size. Thus, the method can be used as a preliminary classifier if desired. Computational complexity is order N, where N is the number of complex baseband data samples. This method is robust in the presence of carrier phase and frequency offsets and can be implemented recursively.

The main interest is on code-division multiple-access (CDMA) networks, although the validity of the proposed approach is not restricted to these networks. The membership of a user terminal to a certain base station (BS) is established if the local mean attenuation to this BS is the lowest one among all surrounding BSs. The estimate of local mean attenuation on the radio links from a mobile terminal to each of the surrounding BSs is carried out through proper filtering of the sequences of received signal strength measurements taken on broadcast signals at regular time intervals. In CDMA networks, pilot channels can be considered, while broadcast control channels can be generically considered in narrow-band systems. A decision is made each time on whether the terminal is to be assigned to its \"current\" BS or if it would be better served by a different BS. Two performance measures are considered: the probability that the best BS is not selected and the average number of membership switchings per time unit. A channel model with log-normal shadowing and fast fading superimposed is considered. Analytical expressions for the above-mentioned performance measures are derived in a general system scenario. From numerical results, it is seen that a proper choice of filter parameters is required to achieve the lowest values for both performance measures. Moreover, these values are not negligible when the mobile terminal is close to a boundary cell region. The obtained results are considered to be of interest in handover and power control algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/26.837047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.837047","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/18093/00837047.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework for analyzing the user membership in cellular CDMA networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/837047/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"A framework for analyzing the user membership in cellular CDMA networks","volume":"48","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6562642","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for analyzing the user membership in cellular CDMA networks","sourcePdf":"00837047.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066256S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","articleId":"837047","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":837048,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Results obtained support that local path-loss distribution can be represented as Weibull or Nakagami in most environments. The close resemblance between such distributions and Rice distribution (with Rayleigh as a special case) confirms that Rice/Rayleigh description of fading can be applied to indoor environments.

A method for evaluating the availability of Ku- and Ka-band dual-polarized digital systems is described. It is based on long-term measurements of slant-path attenuation and depolarization caused by the troposphere and of their joint occurrence. The additional degradation of dual-polarized system availability performance with respect to single polarization operation is assessed, and its dependence on major link and system parameters is highlighted. It appears that satellite links characterized by high-frequency, low elevation angle, circular polarization, and high-level modulation schemes are particularly affected by the depolarization-induced interference. In that case, doubling their capacity by dual-polarization frequency reuse reduces dramatically their availability, assuming a fixed link margin, or alternatively requires prohibitive link margins to meet a given availability objective.","doi":"10.1109/26.837049","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/18093/00837049.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.837049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degradation of availability performance in dual-polarized satellite communications systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=837049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/837049/","displayDocTitle":"Degradation of availability performance in dual-polarized satellite communications systems","volume":"48","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6562644","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degradation of availability performance in dual-polarized satellite communications systems","sourcePdf":"00837049.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032694S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"23","articleId":"837049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":837050,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In this paper, we present a nonlinear algorithm for the separation and demodulation of discrete-time multicomponent AM-FM signals. Our approach divides the demodulation problem into two independent tasks: algebraic separation of the components based on periodicity assumptions and then monocomponent demodulation of each component by instantaneously tracking and separating its source energy into its amplitude and frequency parts. The proposed new algorithm avoids the shortcomings of previous approaches and works well for extremely small spectral separations of the components and for a wide range of relative amplitude/power ratios. We present its theoretical analysis and experimental results and outline its application to demodulation of cochannel FM voice signals.","doi":"10.1109/26.837050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/18093/00837050.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.837050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18093","startPage":"473","endPage":"490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicomponent AM-FM demodulation via periodicity-based algebraic separation and energy-based demodulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=837050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multicomponent AM-FM demodulation via periodicity-based algebraic separation and energy-based demodulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/837050/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6562645","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicomponent AM-FM demodulation via periodicity-based algebraic separation and energy-based demodulation","sourcePdf":"00837050.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07099S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"64","articleId":"837050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":837051,"authors":[{"name":"T.E.

Pioneering studies showed that if the fades connecting pairs of transmit and receive antenna elements are independently, identically distributed, MEAs offer a large increase in capacity compared to single-antenna systems. An MEA system can be described in terms of spatial eigenmodes, which are single-input single-output subchannels. The channel capacity of an MEA is the sum of capacities of these subchannels. We show that the fading correlation affects the MEA capacity by modifying the distributions of the gains of these subchannels. The fading correlation depends on the physical parameters of MEA and the scatterer characteristics. In this paper, to characterize the fading correlation, we employ an abstract model, which is appropriate for modeling narrow-band Rayleigh fading in fixed wireless systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/837052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","volume":"48","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"6562647","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 2000","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fading correlation and its effect on the capacity of multielement antenna systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fading correlation and its effect on the capacity of multielement antenna systems","sourcePdf":"00837052.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037333S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1699","articleId":"837052","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":837053,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Traditional CDMA acquisition techniques suffer from high differences in power levels. The estimation accuracy for a user overwhelmed by stronger ones is likely to be unsatisfactory; at the same time, the interference from a user undergoing acquisition or tracking is not removed by the standard LDD. In this paper, a fully near-far resistant technique for acquisition and tracking for asynchronous CDMA systems applying the LDD is proposed, considering realistic band-limited signals. This technique is based on the adoption of a pair of special sequences equivalent to a dedicated access channel and is shown to provide a relatively fast and robust means to perform channel estimation both in case of single- and multipath channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/18093/00837053.pdf","startPage":"514","endPage":"524","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.837053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.837053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18093","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=837053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-far resistant channel estimation for CDMA systems using the linear decorrelating detector","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Multiaccess communication","Decorrelation","Timing","Detectors","Interference","Base stations","Spread spectrum communication","Robustness","Multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","decorrelation","radio receivers","land mobile radio","estimation theory","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","multipath channels","bandlimited signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-far resistant channel estimation","CDMA systems","linear decorrelating detector","direct-sequence code-division multiple-access","estimation accuracy","interference","acquisition","tracking","asynchronous CDMA systems","band-limited signals","sequences","dedicated access channel","channel estimation","single-path channels","multipath channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/837053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 2000","displayDocTitle":"Near-far resistant channel estimation for CDMA systems using the linear decorrelating detector","volume":"48","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","accessionNumber":"6562648","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-far resistant channel estimation for CDMA systems using the linear decorrelating detector","sourcePdf":"00837053.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038541S","chronDate":"Mar 2000","isNumber":"18093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","articleId":"837053","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":837215,"authors":[{"name":"V.I.

AI is basically embedding human intelligence into a machine so that it can think like a human being. AI is superior to human intelligence in some aspects. The computer with embedded AI techniques can process problems extremely fast compared to human beings; it can work continuously without tiring, and its problem-solving capability is not-affected by emotions and other human shortcomings. Advanced control based on artificial intelligence techniques is called intelligent control. Unlike classical control, intelligent control strategy may not need the mathematical model of the plant.

The main aim of this paper is to suggest a way of building a multi-load/single converter system, based on the use of a series-resonant ZVS inverter supplying several resonant loads. The principle can be probably extended to different applications (DC-to-DC converters, high power induction heating applications) but their study has been restricted to a low power induction heating context. In order to make this study, suitable models for the loaded inductors had to be found. Therefore, in the first part of this document, a number of different electrical inductor models, from the basic L-R equivalent circuit to a representation taking into account eddy currents effects, are presented. The second part describes the multi-load operating principle with respecting ZVS conditions, by the analysis of an R-L inductor model. Finally, the third part completes this work with simulations, including a more realistic model of the inductors and the associated experimental validation.

A higher number of harmonics are thus eliminated at the mains for a given switching frequency while maintaining a control capability of the output DC current in a wide range.

It is shown using theoretical analysis and experimental results, that by using logic, the angle estimation scheme gains a high level of robustness and reliability. A theoretical and quantitative analysis of the noise and error commonly found in practical motor drives is given, and how this can affect SR motor position estimation.

For the practical application of the proposed charging, the power transmission efficiency of the WTPI must be high, and data transmission by way of the WTPI coupling needs to be bidirectional and fast enough for the real-time data feedback and charging control. By analyzes on the transmission performance using equivalent circuits, the power transmission efficiency of about 92% and the data transmission bandwidth of 8.5 Mbps are obtained with the practical WTPI coupling configuration.

In this paper, a detailed analysis and the spectral characteristics of a random carrier-frequency (RCF) technique for suppressing conducted EMI in an offline switched-mode power supply are presented. The analysis provides a theoretical platform for studying the characteristics of this random switching scheme. The level of randomness is defined for the RCF scheme and varied in the converter example so that the effects on the power spectra can be demonstrated. Theoretical predictions of the spectral characteristics of this scheme are confirmed with measurements. The RCF scheme has been compared with the standard constant-frequency pulsewidth modulation (PWM) scheme and the FM scheme.

This paper reviews those developments and shows how demonstrated molecular devices might be combined to design molecular-scale electronic digital computer logic. The design for the demonstrated rectifying molecular diode switches is refined and made more compatible with the demonstrated wires through the introduction of intramolecular dopant groups chemically bonded to modified molecular wires. Quantum mechanical calculations are performed to characterize some of the electrical properties of the proposed molecular diode switches. Explicit structural designs are displayed for AND, OR, and XOR gates that are built from molecular wires and molecular diode switches. The diode-based molecular electronic logic gates are combined to produce a design for a molecular-scale electronic half adder and a molecular-scale electronic full adder. These designs correspond to conductive monomolecular circuit structures that would be one million times smaller in area than the corresponding micron-scale digital logic circuits fabricated on conventional solid-state semiconductor computer chips. It appears likely that these nanometer-scale molecular electronic logic circuits could be fabricated and tested in the foreseeable future. At the very least, such molecular circuit designs constitute an exploration of the ultimate limits of electronic computer circuit miniaturization.","doi":"10.1109/5.838115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18095","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.838115","endPage":"426","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/18095/00838115.pdf","startPage":"386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architectures for molecular electronic computers.

Both codes are based on the prime sequence algorithm and have shown improved performance compared to the previously proposed two-dimensional (2-D) prime code. Effective implementation of the 3-D code has also been proposed. In order to eliminate the requirement of fiber ribbons and multiple star couplers in space/wavelength/time spread 3-D code based optical networks, a wavelength/sup 2//time scheme has been suggested, in which the periodic property of an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) is used. It has been shown that the system performance can be maximized for given resources with a proper choice of the wavelength/sup 2//time scheme.

Crosstalk arises mainly from interactions between subcarriers on one wavelength and the optical carrier of another wavelength. In a dispersive fiber, crosstalk can be attributed to stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and cross-phase modulation (XPM) combined with group velocity dispersion (GVD). We investigate the phase relationship between SRS-induced and XPM-induced crosstalks. Crosstalks induced by SRS and XPM add in the electrical domain and can interfere constructively or destructively. Experimental results show that the combined crosstalk level can be as high as 40 dBc after 25 km of SMF with two wavelengths and 18 dBm per wavelength of transmitted power. We propose two crosstalk countermeasures. The first countermeasure uses parallel fiber transmission. We show theoretically that both SRS-induced and XPM-induced crosstalks can be cancelled to the first order. We present an experimental demonstration of concept which has achieved 15 dB of crosstalk cancellation over 200 MHz. The second countermeasure uses optical carrier suppression. We show, theoretically and experimentally, that by suppressing the optical carrier, we can significantly reduce crosstalk while maintaining the same link budget and carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) at the receiver, 20 dB of crosstalk reduction over 2 GHz has been demonstrated experimentally.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/18098/00838125.pdf","startPage":"512","endPage":"520","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.838125","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.838125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18098","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=838125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear crosstalk and two countermeasures in SCM-WDM optical communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear optics","Optical crosstalk","Optical receivers","Fiber nonlinear optics","Optical scattering","Stimulated emission","Optical modulation","Wavelength division multiplexing","Optical fiber communication","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subcarrier multiplexing","wavelength division multiplexing","optical fibre networks","stimulated Raman scattering","optical crosstalk","optical fibre dispersion","optical receivers","optical noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear crosstalk","countermeasures","SCM-WDM optical communication systems","subcarrier-multiplexed wavelength-division multiplexed optical communication systems","optical carrier","dispersive fiber","stimulated Raman scattering","SRS","cross-phase modulation","group velocity dispersion","phase relationship","XPM-induced crosstalk","SRS-induced crosstalk","electrical domain","transmitted power","crosstalk cancellation","optical carrier suppression","link budget","carrier-to-noise ratio","crosstalk reduction","25 km"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/838125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2000","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear crosstalk and two countermeasures in SCM-WDM optical communication systems","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6584983","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear crosstalk and two countermeasures in SCM-WDM optical communication systems","sourcePdf":"00838125.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035913S","chronDate":"April  2000","isNumber":"18098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"51","articleId":"838125","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":838127,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Recently, most of the effort in optical amplifier switch modules have been focused on monolithic switches in which the entire device is fabricated on an InP substrate together with the semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA's). In this paper, we investigate the use of SOA's with passive polymer waveguides to make hybrid switches of varying sizes. The optical amplifiers serve dual purposes, gating the signal and amplifying the signal. Amplification is needed in order to offset the losses associated with the passive waveguide elements as well as the losses from component misalignments in the switch module. Our analysis finds the largest switch module size that can be made with the architecture used. We also calculate the maximum number of switch modules which can be cascaded in order to retain a bit-error rate (BER) under 10/sup -9/.","doi":"10.1109/50.838129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.838129","startPage":"546","endPage":"554","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/18098/00838129.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid optical switch using passive polymer waveguides and semiconductor optical amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2000","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid optical switch using passive polymer waveguides and semiconductor optical amplifiers","publicationDate":"April 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6584987","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/838129/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid optical switch using passive polymer waveguides and semiconductor optical amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00838129.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04291S","chronDate":"April  2000","isNumber":"18098","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"7","articleId":"838129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":838138,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This consists of performing repeated stages in each one of which we identify a substring of the current version of the text yielding the maximum compression, and then replace all those occurrences except one with a pair of pointers to the untouched occurrence. This is somewhat dual with respect to the bottom up vocabulary buildup scheme considered by Rubin. This simple scheme already poses some interesting algorithmic problems. In terms of performance, the method does outperform current Lempel-Ziv implementations in most of cases. Here we show that, on biological sequences, it beats all other generic compression methods and approaches the performance of methods specifically built around some peculiar regularities of DNA sequences, such as tandem repeats and palindromes, that are neither distinguished nor treated selectively here. The most interesting performances, however, are obtained in the compression of entire groups of genetic sequences forming families with similar characteristics. This is becoming a standard and useful way to group sequences in a growing number of important specialized databases. On such inputs, the approach presented here yields scores that are not only better than those of any other method, but also improve increasingly with increasing input size. This is to be attributed to a certain ability to capture distant relationships among the sequences in a family.","doi":"10.1109/DCC.2000.838154","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC 2000.

The expensive activity during compression is sorting of all the rotations of the block of data to compress. Burrows and Wheeler (1994) describe an efficient implementation of rotation sorting but give little analysis of its performance. This paper addresses that need. We present the base algorithm using a more formal framework, describe two important optimisations not present in the original paper, and measure performance of the variants on a set of 14 files. For completeness, a tuned implementation of Sadakane's (1998) sorting algorithm was also tested. Merely measuring running times gives poor insight into the finer aspects of performance on contemporary machine architectures. We report measurements of instruction counts and cache misses for the algorithms giving a clearer picture of which variants perform well, and why.","doi":"10.1109/DCC.2000.838157","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC 2000.

The algorithm is based on bit-plane entropy coding of reordered transform coefficients, similar to the progressive wavelet codec (PWC) previously introduced. Unlike PWC, however, our new progressive transform coder (PTC) does not use wavelets; it performs the space-frequency decomposition step via a new lapped biorthogonal transform (LBT). PTC achieves a rate distortion performance that is comparable (within 2%) to that of the state-of-the-art SPIHT (set partitioning in hierarchical trees) codec. However, thanks to the use of the LBT, the space-frequency decomposition step in PTC reduces the number of multiplications per pixel by a factor of 2.7, and the number of additions by about 15%, when compared to the fastest possible implementation of the \"9/7\" wavelet transform via lifting. Furthermore, since most of the computation in the LBT is in fact performed by a DCT, our PTC codec can make full use of fast software and hardware modules for 1D and 2D DCT.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC 2000.

The remaining data are uniformly quantized without any changes of bin boundaries. As a result, a more effective low-cost quantization scheme was constructed. It allows us to significantly increase the compression efficiency of images. An experimental rate-distortion curve shows the same distortion for decreased bit rates even up to 20% in comparison to standard uniform quantization.

The input-bandlimited signal can be reconstructed from this information locally, and with a mean squared error which is inversely proportional to the square of the oversampling factor, MSE=O(1/r/sup 2/). Consequently the mean squared error of this scheme exhibits exponential decay in the bit rate.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Sampling methods","Analog-digital conversion","Signal resolution","White noise","Rate-distortion","Entropy coding","Signal analysis","Laboratories","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","signal sampling","signal representation","signal reconstruction","mean square error methods","bandlimited signals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oversampled A/D conversion","exponential bit-rate accuracy","analog-to-digital conversion","single bit quantization","exponential error decay","zero crossings","deterministic dither function","input signal representation","bandlimited signal","signal reconstruction","mean squared error"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DCC.2000.838174","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC 2000.

Intra-coding is an important tool to mitigate the effects of packet loss by limiting error propagation. This work proposes an algorithm for intra/inter coding mode selection, while utilizing the feedback channel that carries acknowledgement information about received packets. The overall distortion in frame reconstruction at the decoder due to quantization, error concealment (after packet loss) and error propagation is estimated at pixel-level precision, and is dynamically refined based on the feedback information. The estimate is then integrated into a rate-distortion (RD) framework for optimal selection of coding mode for each macroblock. Simulation results demonstrate that precise distortion estimation enables the coder to achieve substantial and consistent gain in PSNR over known state-of-the-art feedback-based mode selection modes.","doi":"10.1109/DCC.2000.838185","publicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC 2000.

Low power VLSI video compression processors are in high demand for the emerging wireless video applications. Video compression processors include VLSI implementation of a motion estimation algorithm. Many motion estimation algorithms are found in the literature. Some of them are fast but cannot guarantee an optimal solution; they can be stuck in local optima. Such algorithms are fast, consumes less power when implemented in VLSI, but they can result in high levels of distortion that cannot be accepted in many applications. On the other hand the full search block matching algorithm (FSBM) is computationally intensive and a VLSI implementation of such an algorithm has high power consumption. This paper presents an exhaustive search algorithm for block matching motion estimation. The proposed algorithm reduces the computational load with successive elimination of non-candidate blocks in the search window. Our proposed algorithm assigns each pixel to a category depending on its value. The number of categories is predetermined. The algorithm consists of number of stages, the first of which has the fewer categories, eliminating those search points that are the farthest from the match. The last stage is the FSBM but with fewer search points. This computational reduction leads to low-power VLSI implementation of the algorithm. Also, it leads to faster efficient motion estimation procedure. The correctness of this algorithm and its complexity are proved.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings DCC 2000.

For general aviation, or small private aircraft, this is too costly for most pilot's budget. The compass system described here provides heading, pitch and roll outputs accurate to one degree, or better. The shortfall of this low-cost approach is that the compass outputs are affected by acceleration and turns.

This paper describes an attitude determination system that is based on two vector measurements of non-zero, non-colinear vectors. The algorithm is based on a quaternion formulation of Wahba's (1966) problem, whereby the error quaternion (q/sub e/) becomes the observed state and can be cast into a standard linear measurement equation. Using the Earth's magnetic field and gravity as the two measured quantities, a low-cost attitude determination system is proposed. An iterated least-squares solution to the attitude determination problem is tested on simulated static cases, and shown to be globally convergent. A time-varying Kalman filter implementation of the same formulation is tested on simulated data and experimental data from a maneuvering aircraft. The time-varying Kalman filter implementation of this algorithm is exercised on simulated and real data collected from an inexpensive triad of accelerometers and magnetometers. The accelerometers in conjunction with the derivative of GPS velocity provided a measure of the gravitation field vector and the magnetometers measured the Earth's magnetic field vector. Tracking errors on experimental data are shown to be less than 1 degree mean and standard deviation of approximately 11 degrees in yaw, and 3 degrees in pitch and roll. Best case performance of the system during maneuvering is shown to improve standard deviations to approximately 3 degrees in yaw, and 1.5 degrees in pitch and roll.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE 2000.

The paper first presents normalized miss distance curves showing how the target spiraling frequency and amplitude along with the interceptor guidance system time constant determine the miss distance for a proportional navigation guidance system. It is then shown how more advanced guidance techniques can be used to improve the system performance against spiraling targets. The advanced guidance techniques require knowledge of various target states plus the target weave frequency. Various Kalman filtering options for estimating the states required for the advanced guidance law are presented. Preliminary miss distance results are presented with each of the candidate filtering options.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PLANS.2000.838314","publicationTitle":"IEEE 2000.

Full autonomy implies that the guidance and navigation system employed must exhibit the highest level of integrity. This paper looks at the parity space fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods, and its applicability in fully autonomous guidance and navigation systems in a decentralised system architecture. Using the existing work as a starting point this paper identifies the effectiveness of these methods when applied to situations where both the hardware and analytical redundancy exist. One of the most important issues in FDD in navigation systems using redundant sensors relates to the integrity of the solution processing architecture. This has motivated the development of multiple FDD solutions running on numerous separate processors in a decentralised computing network. Typical solutions to this problem are based on decentralised or multiple Kalman filters running in parallel. This paper addresses the use and merits of the information filter form of the Kalman filter in a fully decentralised FDD framework.","doi":"10.1109/PLANS.2000.838326","publicationTitle":"IEEE 2000.

Because FG can release respirable fibers during manufacture and handling, respiratory health in the FG workplace has been the focus of numerous studies. Ongoing epidemiology studies of fiber glass workers find no consistent evidence of a causal relationship between human health effects and fiber glass exposure. However, in 1987, IARC designated fiber glass a \"possible carcinogen.\" A 1988-98 series of rodent fiber inhalation studies evaluated the respiratory effects of 15 different inorganic fibers (including 4 FGs). The studies showed a strong relationship between toxicity and biopersistence-fibers that cleared from the lung quickly were innocuous and those that showed little/no clearance induced permanent effects. Thus, fiber biopersistence tests in rats are now accepted in Europe and recognized in the US as valid indicators of potential chronic toxicity. Furthermore, regulatory agencies in Europe and the United States encourage the use of nonbiopersistent FG formulations where possible.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifteenth Annual Battery Conference on Applications and Advances (Cat.

The main framework of the estimator is a three-layer feedforward neural network with four inputs and one output (estimated SOC). The inputs are the battery pack current, accumulated ampere hours, average pack temperature and minimum voltage of the battery modules. A strategy is developed to select the training data set from a large amount of the original testing data sets under different drive cycles and operating conditions. A modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to train the proposed neural network. The designed SOC estimator is validated and evaluated using the testing data under different drive profiles and temperatures. The errors of the SOC estimates are well within the acceptable range compared to that obtained by using traditional mathematical models. The resulting SOC estimator is computationally efficient and can be easily implemented using low-cost microprocessors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Jan. 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/838400/","accessionNumber":"6582804","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 Jan. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Battery pack state of charge estimator design using computational intelligence approaches","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Battery pack state of charge estimator design using computational intelligence approaches","confLoc":"Long Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00838400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024083S","chronDate":"11-14 Jan. 2000","isNumber":"18085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6769","citationCount":"14","articleId":"838400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":838401,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This device is fabricated monolithically on a silicon substrate using a five-layer Parylene process. The operating structure of the check valve is a circular sealing plate on top of a ring-shaped valve seat. The sealing plate is center-anchored on top of a chamber diaphragm that is vacuum-collapsed to the bottom of the chamber in order to achieve a normally closed position. A thin gold layer on the roughened valve seat surface is used to reduce stiction between the sealing plate and the valve seat. We have achieved an in-channel check valve with a cracking (opening) pressure of 20/spl sim/40 kPa under forward bias and no measurable leakage under reverse bias up to 270 kPa. Using this design, this valve performs well in two-phase microfluidic systems (i.e. microchannel flows containing gas, liquid, or gas/liquid mixture).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A normally closed in-channel micro check valve","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Thirteenth Annual International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (Cat.

A diaphragm (6 mm/spl times/6 mm/spl times/0.15 mm) was etched on the Si side for oscillation. The ultrasonic vibration originated from a bulk piezoelectric PZT ceramic (5 mm/spl times/4 mm/spl times/0.15 mm), which was excited by a 60 kHz square wave at 50 V (peak-to-peak). Liquids were mixed in a chamber (6 mm/spl times/6 mm/spl times/0.06 mm) with the Si oscillating diaphragm driven by the PZT. A solution of uranine and water were used to evaluate the mixing effectiveness. The entire process was recorded using a fluorescent microscope equipped with digital camera. The laminar flows of uranine solution (5 /spl mu/l/min) and water (5 /spl mu/l/min) were mixed effectively when the PZT was excited.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Jan 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/838494/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6636004","conferenceDate":"23-27 Jan. 2000","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic micromixer for microfluidic systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic micromixer for microfluidic systems","confLoc":"Miyazaki, Japan","sourcePdf":"00838494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052774S","chronDate":"23-27 Jan 2000","isNumber":"18063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6757","citationCount":"11","articleId":"838494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":838524,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The polymer material, the bonding pressure and the pre-curing time and temperature for the polymer has shown significant influence on void formation in the bond. High bonding pressure and pre-curing times/temperatures that are specific to the polymer material counteract void formation. Process parameters for achieving void-free bonds using benzocyclobutene (BCB) and photoresist coatings as adhesive materials are given. Excellent bonding results have been achieved with BCB as bonding material.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2000.838524","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Thirteenth Annual International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (Cat.

This actuation principle is based on the Marangoni effect and boiling heat transfer, which work as the attraction and release mechanisms respectively. Experimental results show that the frequency of this automatic oscillation is dependent on both bubble size and heater geometry. The surrounding liquid temperature is also a key factor for the feasibility of such motion. The major microfluidic phenomena realizing this actuator are analyzed and discussed qualitatively.","doi":"10.1109/MEMSYS.2000.838554","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE Thirteenth Annual International Conference on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (Cat.

The damping force is caused by viscous friction of the gas film between a moving mirror plate and the electrodes. The grooves decrease the damping force and enable the moving plate to be driven at high speed and low driving voltage. To calculate the damping force correctly, it is necessary to consider the viscous friction not only on the moving plate and electrodes, but also on the sidewalls of the grooves. For that purpose, the idea of hydraulic mean depth is introduced and is applied to the Reynolds equation. The calculated damping force shows good agreement with the measured damping force of the developed torsion mirror actuator for optical heads.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/838559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Jan 2000","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 Jan. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6636062","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Damping of micro electrostatic torsion mirror caused by air-film viscosity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping of micro electrostatic torsion mirror caused by air-film viscosity","confLoc":"Miyazaki, Japan","sourcePdf":"00838559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043838S","chronDate":"23-27 Jan 2000","isNumber":"18063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6757","articleId":"838559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":838590,"authors":[{"name":"Tze-Jung Yao","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tze-Jung Yao","id":"37435044000"},{"name":"Sangwook Lee","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Sangwook Lee","id":"37441668100"},{"name":"Weileun Fang","affiliation":["Power Mechanical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Weileun Fang","id":"37289074100"},{"name":"Yu-Chong Tai","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yu-Chong Tai","id":"37268393100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5273-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1084-6999"}],"articleNumber":"838590","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":217},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rubber","Structural rings","Couplers","Etching","Seals","Micromechanical devices","Silicon","Fabrication","Testing","Microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidics","seals (stoppers)","interconnections","silicone rubber","testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicone-rubber O-ring MEMS coupler","reusability","seals","leak rate test","pull-out test","micromachined micro-fluidic couplers","quick-connect","60 psi"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a novel type of a \"quick-connect\" for micro-fluidic devices realized by a simple silicone-rubber O-ring MEMS coupler.

Once the target microbe is trapped at the focal point of the laser manipulator, we can easily realize exclusion of excess microbes by controlling the electric field, while keeping the target trapped at the focal point. To realize an efficient separation system, we made a new separation cell by microfabrication. We show experimental results on our system. We also propose indirect manipulation methods by the micro-tools to avoid direct laser radiation to the target. Some preliminary experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness. Our method is extremely useful in the pure cultivation of the targeted microbe and will be a promising method for biologists in discovering a new microbe or for bio-remediation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/838608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Jan 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6636110","conferenceDate":"23-27 Jan. 2000","displayDocTitle":"High speed random separation of microobject in microchip by laser manipulator and dielectrophoresis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High speed random separation of microobject in microchip by laser manipulator and dielectrophoresis","confLoc":"Miyazaki, Japan","sourcePdf":"00838608.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032783S","chronDate":"23-27 Jan 2000","isNumber":"18063","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6757","citationCount":"31","articleId":"838608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":838609,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Two types of air-to-liquid interfaces were investigated. The first, consisted of a stationary meniscus with moving particles; and second, stationary particles with an oscillating liquid meniscus.

Each fuzzy rule in our classification system has antecedent linguistic values and a single consequent class. We use a fuzzy reasoning method based on a single winner rule in the classification phase. The winner rule for a new pattern is the fuzzy rule that has the maximum compatibility grade with the new pattern. When we use fuzzy rules with certainly grades, the winner is determined as the rule with the maximum product of the compatibility grade and the certainty grade. In this paper, the effect of rule weights is illustrated by drawing classification boundaries using fuzzy rules with/without certainty grades. It is also shown that certainly grades play an important role when a fuzzy rule-based classification system is a mixture of general rules and specific rules. Through computer simulations, we show that fuzzy rule-based systems with high classification performance can be designed without modifying the membership functions of antecedent linguistic values when we use fuzzy rules with certainty grades.","displayPublicationTitle":"Ninth IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.

Progress in microelectronic technology is extremely fast and it is outstripping the system designers' abilities to make use of the created opportunities. The complexity and quality of the microelectronics-based systems as well as their design and production cost and time tend to be more limited by the design methods and tools than by the microelectronic technology. Substantial improvement can only be achieved through development and application of a new generation of more suitable design paradigms, methods and tools. In this paper, some new opportunities and difficulties related to the system-on-a-chip technology are overviewed, the nature of the complex system design problems is analyzed and an appropriate quality-driven system design methodology is proposed and discussed. Some important implications of the modern quality concepts for design modeling, design exploration techniques and tools, design decision making, design reuse and design validation are also discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE 2000 First International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (Cat.

The design of the chip at functional-block level is directly captured by the simulator, allowing the assessment of the chip layout impact on the system performance due to the elevated operational temperature. The heat generation for each block is obtained by running the circuit-level electrical simulation separately on individual functional units. The thermal diffusion equation is then solved based on the actual structure of the chip including substrate and interconnect/insulating layers. Different thermal conductivity can be specified for each material layer. The effect of package on chip temperature distribution is modeled using thermally resistive layers as the boundary between the simulated structure and surrounding environment. Proper adjustment of the boundary thermal resistance results in the correct range of simulated temperature distribution as compared to the measured data. Both physics and implementation for the thermal simulation are described. The code is applied to the analysis of a realistic design of a CPU chip made of SOI technology with up to six metal interconnect layers. A comprehensive review of the simulation results is presented.","doi":"10.1109/ISQED.2000.838867","publicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE 2000 First International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (Cat.

Although some antenna synthesis techniques can be used to reduce the side-lobe levels (and hence reduce the effect of interference arriving outside the main lobe), the resulting array factors suffer from the increased width of the main lobe. This degradation is more profound in phased arrays operating at large scanning angles and hence, the performance will be limited in many applications requiring radiation patterns with narrow steerable main lobes. In this paper, a technique based on radial-basis function neural networks (RBFNN) is presented for shaping the array factor of phased linear arrays to have relatively low side-lobe levels without affecting the beamwidth requirements of the main lobe. Both uniform and nonuniform linear arrays with initially low sidelobe levels, such as Tschebyscheff arrays are considered. The simulation results show that the use of RBFNN minimizes the sidelobe levels while keeping a predetermined width of main lobes. Thus, highly improved patterns with very deep sidelobe and increased directivity, with beam steering capabilities, are obtained.","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2000.838904","startPage":"B14/1","endPage":"B1410","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventeenth National Radio Science Conference. 17th NRSC'2000 (IEEE Cat.

Until recently, it was sufficient to model die-to-die shifts in device (active) and wire (passive) parameters, leading to a natural worst-case design methodology. In the deep-submicron era, however, within-die variations in these same device and wire parameters become just as important. In fact, current integrated circuits are large enough that variations within the die are as large as variations from die-to-die. Furthermore, while die-to-die shifts are substantially independent of the design, within-die variations are profoundly influenced by the detailed physical implementation of the IC. This changes the fundamental view of process variability from something that is imposed on the design by the fabrication process to something that is co-generated between the design and the process. This paper starts by examining the sources and historical trends in device and wire variability, distinguishing between inter-die and intra-die variations, and proposes techniques for design for variability (DOV) in the presence of both types of variations.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings IEEE 2000 First International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (Cat.

An efficient approach to reduce the computation time taken by neural networks for the searching process is introduced. We combine both Fourier and wavelet transforms with cooperative modular neural networks (MNNs) to enhance the performance of the detection process. Such an approach is applied to identify human faces automatically in cluttered scenes. Here, neural networks are used to test whether a window of 20/spl times/20 pixels contains a face or not. The major difficulty in the learning process comes from the large database required for face/nonface images. A simple design for cooperative MNNs is presented to solve this problem by dividing these data into some groups. Such division results in reduction of computational complexity and thus decreasing the time and memory needed during the test of an image. In order to have a faster detection algorithm, a combination of the FFT and the wavelet transform is made in order to reduce the elapsed time during the test phase and enhance the detection performance. Feature measurements of the input faces are made through Fourier descriptors which are insensitive to rotation, translation and scaling. Such a feature is modified to reduce the number of neurons in the hidden layer. The second stage extracts wavelet coefficients that have been shown to provide advantages in terms of better representation for a given data to be compressed. Finally, the resulting vector is fed to one of five neural networks for face detection. Compared to previous work in face detection, the use of this combination reduces the number of neurons required for neural networks. Simulation results for the proposed algorithm show good performance on detecting faces with rotation, occlusion, noise, or change in illumination.","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2000.838925","startPage":"C3/1","endPage":"C3/8","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventeenth National Radio Science Conference. 17th NRSC'2000 (IEEE Cat.

Here the faces are vertically oriented frontal view with scaling, orientation, expression, and illumination changes. There are many research activities on face recognition using the face space which is described by a set of eigenfaces. Each face is efficiently represented by its projection onto the space expanded by the eigenfaces and has a new descriptor. Previous work on eigenface has shown that it performs well only with changes in expression, but results are poor in the case of rotating, or scaling the input face. In order to enhance the performance of the eigenfaces technique to accommodate other variations of the input face, the Fourier vector of each face is projected in the eigenspace. Neural networks are used to recognize the face through learning the correct classification of these new descriptors. A real-time system has been created which combines the face detection and recognition techniques. A recognition rate of 91% has been achieved over real tests. It is also shown that our proposed system behaves accurately in the case of rotated or scaled faces as well as for changes in expression.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/838951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","conferenceDate":"24-24 Feb. 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6650691","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Fourier descriptors and PCA with neural networks for face recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Fourier descriptors and PCA with neural networks for face recognition","confLoc":"Minufiya, Egypt","sourcePdf":"00838951.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062204S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6758","articleId":"838951","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":838959,"authors":[{"name":"S.E.

The's system is based on training a recurrent random neural network (RNN) model on all the possible phases of the used spreading code. The trained network can then be used at the receiver for the initial coarse alignment of the local code phase and the received code. One advantage of this technique over the conventional synchronization techniques is that the phase of the received PN code can be decided without searching the potential code phases. Also the RNN, after being trained, can have a simple hardware realization that makes it candidate for implementation as a dedicated chip. This makes the neural network based technique faster and more robust than the conventional techniques. Computer simulations, carried out on maximal length sequences of length N=7 and N=15, show that the proposed system cast effectively indicate the phase of the received code even with very low signal to noise ratios.","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2000.838959","startPage":"C30/1","endPage":"C3011","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventeenth National Radio Science Conference. 17th NRSC'2000 (IEEE Cat.

The radiation hard designs of essential circuits required to enable the design of an experimental radiation hard CMOS APS image sensor are described. The completed design of a radiation hard CMOS APS image sensor is presented as well. The database of this design has been submitted to a mask house for a mask set generation and then fabrication. Plans for characterizing the chips after fabrication are currently being devised. This research work concludes that radiation hard CMOS APS image sensors are attainable. The combination of employing physical design techniques and a deep submicron standard CMOS fabrication process provides the path to radiation hard CMOS APS image sensors. Utilizing commercial standard CMOS fabrication processes to realize radiation hard image sensors makes economic sense. The cost element associated with these standard processes is less (by at least a factor of two) than the cost element associated with specialized radiation hard processes.","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2000.838967","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Seventeenth National Radio Science Conference. 17th NRSC'2000 (IEEE Cat.

In this paper, an output feedback controller is derived, reconstructing the axial flow velocity from vehicle speed measurements, using a three-state model of propeller shaft speed, forward (surge) speed of the vehicle, and the axial flow velocity. Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove that a nonlinear observer combined with an output feedback integral controller provide exponential stability. The output feedback controller compensates for variations in thrust due to time variations in advance speed. This is a major problem when applying conventional vehicle-propeller control systems. The proposed controller is simulated for an underwater vehicle equipped with a single propeller. The simulations demonstrate that the axial water velocity can be estimated with good accuracy.

It consists of performing symbolic suppression of each subcircuit to its terminals in terms of subcircuit matrix determinants and cofactors, and applying Cramer's rule to symbolically solve the set of equations at the top level of the circuit hierarchy. An annotated, directed, and acyclic graph, called determinant decision diagram (DDD), is used to represent symbolic determinants of subcircuit matrices and cofactors used in subcircuit suppression, as well as symbolic determinants of the top-level circuit matrix and cofactors required in applying Cramer's rule. DDD enables us to systematically exploit the inherent sparsity of circuit matrices and the sharing of symbolic expressions. It is capable of representing a huge number of symbolic product terms in a canonical and highly compact manner. The proposed method is illustrated using a Cauer parameter low-pass filter.

This expands the thermal noise analysis capability to switched capacitor circuits and oversampled delta-sigma modulators. Thermal noise generated by different elements is modeled, in the time-domain, by a random pulse waveform having a desired power spectral density. Typically the noise power level is much smaller than that of other desired signals in the circuit and accurate simulation is needed to obtain correct results. In addition, random noise waveforms require the computation of many time points in each transient analysis and efficient simulation methods are needed. In this paper, a new method for computing the transient response of linear time invariant circuits is used. This method accurately and efficiently computes the response to the random pulse waveforms. In addition to thermal noise, the method can also be used to simulate the effect of random dither signals in delta-sigma modulators.

In particular, two major drawbacks are convergence to a local minima and long learning time. We propose an efficient learning method for a FNN that combines the BP strategy and optimization layer by layer. More precisely, we construct the layer-wise optimization method using the Taylor series expansion of nonlinear operators describing a FNN and propose to update weights of each layer by the BP-based Kaczmarz iterative procedure. The experimental results show that the new learning algorithm is stable, it reduces the learning time and demonstrates improvement of generalization results in comparison with other well-known methods.","doi":"10.1109/72.839001","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/18100/00839001.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"305","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.839001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The layer-wise method and the backpropagation hybrid approach to learning a feedforward neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"The layer-wise method and the backpropagation hybrid approach to learning a feedforward neural network","volume":"11","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6580869","pubMedId":"18249761","publicationDate":"March 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The layer-wise method and the backpropagation hybrid approach to learning a feedforward neural network","sourcePdf":"00839001.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045247S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"18100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"28","articleId":"839001","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":839002,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

Constraints on the coefficients of the cost function, in the form of a vector norm, are considered. Unlike the previous cost function for the PRNN, which included a forgetting factor motivated by the recursive least squares (RLS) strategy, the proposed forms of cost function provide \"forgetting\" of the outputs of adjacent modules based upon the network architecture. Such an approach takes into account the number of modules in the PRNN, through the unit norm constraint on the coefficients of the cost function of the PRNN. This is shown to be particularly suitable, since due to inherent nesting in the PRNN, every module gives its full contribution to the learning process, whereas the unit norm constrained cost function introduces a sense of forgetting in the memory management of the PRNN.

For functions belonging to a rather general class, characterized by certain smoothness properties with respect to the L/sub 2/ norm, we compute upper bounds on the approximation error where error is measured by the L/sub q/ norm, 1/spl les/q/spl les//spl infin/. These results extend previous work, applicable in the case q=2, and provide an explicit algorithm to achieve the derived approximation error rate. In the range q/spl les/2 near-optimal rates of convergence are demonstrated. A gap remains, however, with respect to a recently established lower bound in the case q>2, although the rates achieved are provably better than those obtained by optimal linear approximation. Extensions of the results from the L/sub 2/ norm to L/sub p/ are also discussed. A further interesting conclusion from our results is that no loss of generality is suffered using networks with positive hidden-to-output weights. Moreover, explicit bounds on the size of the hidden-to-output weights are established, which are sufficient to guarantee the established convergence rates.","doi":"10.1109/72.839004","startPage":"323","endPage":"337","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/18100/00839004.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.839004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the optimality of neural-network approximation using incremental algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation algorithms","Function approximation","Neural networks","Approximation error","Convergence","Absorption","Upper bound","Linear approximation","Surges","Adaptive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["function approximation","neural nets","optimisation","convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","incremental algorithms","optimal function approximation","smoothness properties","L/sub 2/ norm","upper bounds","approximation error rate","near-optimal convergence rates","positive hidden-to-output weights"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839004/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"On the optimality of neural-network approximation using incremental algorithms","volume":"11","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6580872","pubMedId":"18249764","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the optimality of neural-network approximation using incremental algorithms","sourcePdf":"00839004.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062125S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"18100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"23","articleId":"839004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":839006,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Xing Li","affiliation":["Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA","Department of Mathematics, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hong-Xing Li","id":"37087458866"},{"name":"C.L.P.

The algorithm is a decompositional approach which can be applied to any neural network whose output function is monotone such as a sigmoid function. Therefore, the algorithm can be applied to multilayer neural networks, recurrent neural networks and so on. It does not depend on training algorithms, and its computational complexity is polynomial. The basic idea is that the units of neural networks are approximated by Boolean functions. But the computational complexity of the approximation is exponential, and so a polynomial algorithm is presented. The author has applied the algorithm to several problems to extract understandable and accurate rules. The paper shows the results for the votes data, mushroom data, and others. The algorithm is extended to the continuous domain, where extracted rules are continuous Boolean functions. Roughly speaking, the representation by continuous Boolean functions means the representation using conjunction, disjunction, direct proportion, and reverse proportion. This paper shows the results for iris data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839008/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6580875","pubMedId":"18249768","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Extracting rules from trained neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extracting rules from trained neural networks","sourcePdf":"00839008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038071S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"18100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"109","articleId":"839008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-28"},{"_id":839010,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Zadeh proposed (1994) a twist to the problem, which, he suggested, would require a fuzzy logic controller. This experiment uses a beam, partially covered with a sticky substance, increasing the difficulty of predicting the ball's motion. We complicated this problem even more by not using any information concerning the ball's velocity. Although it is common to use the first differences of the ball's consecutive positions as a measure of velocity and explicit input to the controller, we preferred to exploit recurrent neural networks, inputting only consecutive positions instead. We have used truncated backpropagation through time with the node-decoupled extended Kalman filter (NDEKF) algorithm to update the weights in the networks. Our best neurocontroller uses a form of approximate dynamic programming called an adaptive critic design. A hierarchy of such designs exists. Our system uses dual heuristic programming (DHP), an upper-level design. To our best knowledge, our results are the first use of DHP to control a physical system. It is also the first system we know of to respond to Zadeh's challenge. We do not claim this neural network control algorithm is the best approach to this problem, nor do we claim it is better than a fuzzy controller. It is instead a contribution to the scientific dialogue about the boundary between the two overlapping disciplines.","doi":"10.1109/72.839012","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/18100/00839012.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"435","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.839012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neurocontroller alternatives for \"fuzzy\" ball-and-beam systems with nonuniform nonlinear friction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839012/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","displayDocTitle":"Neurocontroller alternatives for \"fuzzy\" ball-and-beam systems with nonuniform nonlinear friction","volume":"11","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6580879","pubMedId":"18249772","publicationDate":"March 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neurocontroller alternatives for \"fuzzy\" ball-and-beam systems with nonuniform nonlinear friction","sourcePdf":"00839012.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046238S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"18100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"53","articleId":"839012","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":839013,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We present two constructive learning algorithms, MPyramid-real and MTiling-real, that extend the pyramid and tiling algorithms, respectively, for learning real to M-ary mappings (i.e., classification problems involving real-valued input attributes and multiple output classes).

When done prior to classification, estimates obtained in the lower dimension subspace are more reliable. For some classifiers, there is also an improvement in performance due to the removal of the diluting effect of redundant information. A majority of the present approaches to dimensionality reduction are based on scatter matrices or other statistics of the data which do not directly correlate to classification accuracy. The optimality criteria of choice for the purposes of classification is the Bayes error. Usually however, Bayes error is difficult to express analytically. We propose an optimality criteria based on an approximation of the Bayes error and use it to formulate a linear and a nonlinear method of dimensionality reduction. The nonlinear method we propose, relies on using a multilayered perceptron which produces as output the lower dimensional representation. It thus differs from autoassociative like multilayered perceptrons which have been proposed and used for dimensionality reduction. Our results show that the nonlinear method is, as anticipated, superior to the linear method in that it can perform unfolding of a nonlinear manifold. In addition, the nonlinear method we propose provides substantially better lower dimension representation (for classification purposes) than Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD) and two other nonlinear methods of dimensionality reduction that are often used.","doi":"10.1109/72.839014","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"452","endPage":"463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.839014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18100","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/18100/00839014.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Multilayer perceptrons","Error analysis","Data visualization","Statistics","Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Pattern recognition","Computer science","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern classification","Bayes methods","optimisation","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes-optimality motivated linear dimensionality reduction","multilayered perceptron-based dimensionality reduction","redundant information removal","optimality criteria","Bayes error","nonlinear method","nonlinear manifold unfolding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bayes-optimality motivated linear and multilayered perceptron-based dimensionality reduction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839014/","volume":"11","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"6580881","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"18249774","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayes-optimality motivated linear and multilayered perceptron-based dimensionality reduction","sourcePdf":"00839014.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048904S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"18100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"17","articleId":"839014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":839015,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, the GEKF is very computationally intensive, which has led to the development of efficient algorithms such as the multiple extended Kalman algorithm (MEKA) and the decoupled extended Kalman filter algorithm (DEKF), that are based on dimensional reduction and/or partitioning of the global problem. In this paper we present a new training algorithm, called local linearized least squares (LLLS), that is based on viewing the local system identification subproblems at the neuron level as recursive linearized least squares problems. The objective function of the least squares problems for each neuron is the sum of the squares of the linearized backpropagated error signals. The new algorithm is shown to give better convergence results for three benchmark problems in comparison to MEKA, and in comparison to DEKF for highly coupled applications. The performance of the LLLS algorithm approaches that of the GEKF algorithm in the experiments.","doi":"10.1109/72.839017","startPage":"487","endPage":"495","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.839017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18100","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/18100/00839017.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A local linearized least squares algorithm for training feedforward neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839017/","displayDocTitle":"A local linearized least squares algorithm for training feedforward neural networks","volume":"11","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6580884","pubMedId":"18249777","publicationDate":"March 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A local linearized least squares algorithm for training feedforward neural networks","sourcePdf":"00839017.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045495S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"18100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"12","articleId":"839017","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":839019,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, the nonlinear combination of time series forecasts is proposed, based on isolated use of neural networks, fuzzy logic and neuro-fuzzy systems.

The proposed system organises the behaviours hierarchically and uses fuzzy engines to implement both the behaviours and their co-ordination mechanism. In previous work (1999) we reported on our success in the online learning of individual behaviours (rules and membership functions). In this paper we report on a system that allows the fuzzy membership function (MF) for behaviour co-ordination to be learnt online in a manner that satisfies some high level mission or plan. The GAs use adaptive learning parameters and guided constrained optimisation to speed the GAs search and enable it to be performed via real-world interaction rather than off-line simulation. The results of this work are compared with results reported elsewhere and reveals this approach to have a superior learning performance while learning using real outdoor robots in changing environments. The ability to learn co-ordination skills in a short time interval without human intervention makes this approach particularly useful for applications where access is difficult such as nuclear reactors, underwater vehicles and space robots and fast changing and dynamic environments such as the agricultural environments.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.2000.839143","startPage":"853","endPage":"858 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Ninth IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems.

The premise and defuzzification parts are static while the consequent parts are recurrent neural networks with internal feedback and time delay synapses. The network is trained by means of a novel learning algorithm, bused on the concept of constrained optimization. The suggested algorithm is general since it can be applied to locally as well as fully recurrent networks, regardless of their structure. An adaptation mechanism of the maximum parameter change is also developed. The proposed dynamic model, equipped with the learning algorithm, is employed as a noise cancellation filter, where it is compared with the ANFIS fuzzy filter. Simulation results show that the suggested model compares favorably with its competing rival and can be regarded as a reliable, general adaptive filter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839147/","accessionNumber":"6629641","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"7-10 May 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A generalized TSK dynamic fuzzy neural network: application to adaptive noise cancellation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized TSK dynamic fuzzy neural network: application to adaptive noise cancellation","confLoc":"San Antonio, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00839147.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033713S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6771","citationCount":"3","articleId":"839147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":839167,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Hsun Chou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chung Hua University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Hsun Chou","id":"37087331762"},{"name":"Jou-Nan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chung Hua University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jou-Nan Chen","id":"37088067441"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5877-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1098-7584"}],"articleNumber":"839167","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":196},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Evolution (biology)","Convergence","Biological cells","Terminology","Genetic mutations","Data mining","Computer science","Electronic mail","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["initialization schemes","genes extraction","dynamic crossover","mutation rates","population size","encoding length","extraction operator","uniform initialization","unbiased initialization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=839167","abstract":"Many researchers on GAs lay great emphasis on the improvements of the methods of crossover, mutation and selection.

Such systems typically connect one or more FPGAs to the host computer via an I/O bus. Some have shown remarkable speedups, albeit limited to specific application domains. Many factors limit the general usefulness of such systems. Long reconfiguration times prevent the acceleration of applications that spread their time over many different tasks. Low-bandwidth paths for data transfer limit the usefulness of such systems to tasks that have a high computation-to-memory-bandwidth ratio. In addition, standard FPGA tools require hardware design expertise which is beyond the knowledge of most programmers. To help investigate the viability of connected FPGA systems, the authors designed their own architecture called Garp and experimented with running applications on it. They are also investigating whether Garp's design enables automatic, fast, effective compilation across a broad range of applications. They present their results in this article.","doi":"10.1109/2.839323","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel5/2/18132/00839323.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.839323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Garp architecture and C compiler","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","displayDocTitle":"The Garp architecture and C compiler","volume":"33","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6578148","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839323/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Garp architecture and C compiler","sourcePdf":"00839323.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043123S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"18132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"241","articleId":"839323","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":839324,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

General-purpose processors are struggling to efficiently meet these applications' disparate needs, and custom hardware is rarely feasible. According to the authors, reconfigurable computing, which combines the flexibility of general-purpose processors with the efficiency of custom hardware, can provide the alternative. PipeRench and its associated compiler comprise the authors' new architecture for reconfigurable computing. Combined with a traditional digital signal processor, microcontroller or general-purpose processor, PipeRench can support a system's various computing needs without requiring custom hardware.

Issues are logically divided into architectural and handoff decision time algorithms. The handoff architectures in high-speed local coverage IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs, and low-speed wide area coverage CDPD and GPRS mobile data networks are described and compared. A survey of traditional algorithms and an example of an advanced algorithm using neural networks for PTO decision time in homogeneous networks are presented. The HO architectural issues related to hybrid networks are discussed through an example of a hybrid network that employs GPRS and IEEE 802.11. Five architectures for the example hybrid network, based on emulation of GPRS entities within the WLAN, mobile IP, a virtual access point, and a mobility gateway (proxy), are described and compared. The mobility gateway and mobile IP approaches are selected for more detailed discussion. The differences in applying a complex algorithm for HO decision time in a homogeneous and a hybrid network are shown through an example.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839330/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","publicationDate":"April 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6583570","volume":"7","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Handoff in hybrid mobile data networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handoff in hybrid mobile data networks","sourcePdf":"00839330.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134429S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"18140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"291","articleId":"839330","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":839333,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

On-line monitoring must be done on-site, but an important problem of on-site PD measurement is the superposition of PD data and interference.

Wide-band, fast sampling rate and individually-triggerable memory blocks are available for the acquisition of PD pulse signals. However, a problem of sampling the population of PD pulses arises from the limited available on-line storage memory. Four sampling techniques are investigated and evaluated in order to record an amount of PD pulses which enables PD stochastic inference for a minimum of the on-line memory use. Some statistical indexes based on the pulse-height and pulse-phase distributions are used to compare performances of the different techniques. It is shown that a technique based on the Poisson law provides the most accurate sampling of PD pulses, while minimizing the memory, particularly in the presence of two simultaneously active PD phenomena. The developed procedure enables an accurate analysis of the shape of a large number of PD signals, but also stochastic processing of height distributions, which is becoming a reference for PD pattern analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Data processing","Partial discharges","Pulse measurements","Signal sampling","Pulse shaping methods","Shape measurement","Signal analysis","Stochastic processes","Pattern analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse measurement","partial discharge measurement","signal sampling","data acquisition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random sampling","data processing","pulse height analysis","pulse shape analysis","digital acquisition","partial discharge measurement","oscilloscope","Poisson law","pattern analysis","stochastic processing"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.839338","startPage":"30","endPage":"39","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/18141/00839338.pdf","doi":"10.1109/94.839338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random sampling and data processing for PD-pulse height and shape analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"Random sampling and data processing for PD-pulse height and shape analysis","accessionNumber":"6573064","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","volume":"7","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random sampling and data processing for PD-pulse height and shape analysis","sourcePdf":"00839338.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036183S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"34","articleId":"839338","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":839339,"authors":[{"name":"E.M.

PD distributions coming from different sources, such as internal voids, as well as surface and corona discharges, are compared. In particular, the investigation focuses on the Weibull probability function applied to pulse charge-height distribution. It is shown that the different discharge sources can be identified on the basis of the value of the shape parameter of the Weibull distribution and that identification holds even when two PD sources are combined, i.e. are active simultaneously. In this case, the application of the 5-parameter Weibull function permits separation of PD phenomena, and recognition by means of the shape parameter value associated to each phenomenon. Finally, the proposed procedure is applied to practical objects, i.e. insulation systems of rotating machines, with real insulation defects, showing promising on-field application prospective.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/18141/00839341.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"58","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/94.839341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.839341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18141","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=839341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PD source recognition by Weibull processing of pulse height distributions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partial discharges","Surface discharges","Corona","Fault location","Shape","Dielectrics and electrical insulation","Oscilloscopes","Marine vehicles","Digital recording","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial discharge measurement","Weibull distribution","pulse measurement","voids (solid)","corona","surface discharges","insulation testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PD source recognition","pulse height distribution","partial discharge measurement","insulation system","surface discharge","void","corona discharge","Weibull probability function","rotating machine","shape parameter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839341/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"PD source recognition by Weibull processing of pulse height distributions","volume":"7","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6573066","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PD source recognition by Weibull processing of pulse height distributions","sourcePdf":"00839341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066387S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18141","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"76","articleId":"839341","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":839345,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Our scheme is based on Golden Ratio Sequences (GRS), which have found applications in broadcast disks, hashing, packet routing, etc. We show by analysis and simulation that GRS is nearly the best possible scheme for 2-dimensional range queries. Specifically, it is the best possible scheme when the number of disks (M) is at most 22; has response time at most one more than that of the best possible scheme for M/spl les/94; and has response time at most three more than that of the best possible scheme for M/spl les/550. We also show that it outperforms the cyclic declustering scheme-a recently proposed scheme that was shown to have better performance than previously known schemes for this problem. We give some analytical results to suggest that the average performance of our scheme is within 14 percent of the optimal scheme. Our analytical results also suggest a worst case response time within a factor 3 of the optimal for any query, and within a factor 1.5 of the optimal for large queries. We also give a multidimensional extension of our scheme, which has better performance than the multidimensional generalization of the cyclic declustering scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839419/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6552294","conferenceDate":"29 Feb.-3 March 2000","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Declustering using golden ratio sequences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Declustering using golden ratio sequences","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00839419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030365S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6778","citationCount":"21","articleId":"839419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":839456,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Both approaches have their limitations: indexing techniques are inefficient in extreme configurations, such as high-dimensional spaces, where even a simple scan may be cheaper than an index-based search. Compression techniques are not very efficient in all other situations. We propose to combine both techniques to search for nearest neighbors in a high-dimensional space. For this purpose, we develop a compressed index, called the IQ-tree, with a three-level structure: the first level is a regular (flat) directory consisting of minimum bounding boxes, the second level contains data points in a compressed representation, and the third level contains the actual data. We overcome several engineering challenges in constructing an effective index structure of this type. The most significant of these is to decide how much to compress at the second level. Too much compression will lead to many needless expensive accesses to the third level. Too little compression will increase both the storage and the access cost for the first two levels. We develop a cost model and an optimization algorithm based on this cost model that permits an independent determination of the degree of compression for each second level page to minimize expected query cost. In an experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that the IQ-tree shows a performance that is the \"best of both worlds\" for a wide range of data distributions and dimensionalities.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2000.839456","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th International Conference on Data Engineering (Cat.

Previous analyses have concluded that nearest neighbor search is hopeless in high dimensions, due to the notorious \"curse of dimensionality\". However, their precise analysis over real data sets is still an open problem. The typical and often implicit assumption in previous studies is that the data is uniformly distributed, with independence between attributes. However, real data sets overwhelmingly disobey these assumptions; rather, they typically are skewed and exhibit intrinsic (\"fractal\") dimensionalities that are much lower than their embedding dimension, e.g., due to subtle dependencies between attributes. We show how the Hausdorff and correlation fractal dimensions of a data set can yield extremely accurate formulas that can predict I/O performance to within one standard deviation. The practical contributions of this work are our accurate formulas which can be used for query optimization in spatial and multimedia databases. The theoretical contribution is the 'deflation' of the dimensionality curse. Our theoretical and empirical results show that previous worst-case analysis of nearest neighbor search in high dimensions are over-pessimistic, to the point of being unrealistic. The performance depends critically on the intrinsic (\"fractal\") dimensionality as opposed to the embedding dimension that the uniformity assumption incorrectly implies.","doi":"10.1109/ICDE.2000.839457","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 16th International Conference on Data Engineering (Cat.

Although these tools are good at injecting a single fault model into a single system, they suffer from two main limitations for use in distributed systems: (1) no single tool is sufficient for injecting all necessary fault models; (2) it is difficult to port these tools to new systems. NFTAPE, a tool for composing automated fault injection experiments from available lightweight fault injectors, triggers, monitors, and other components, helps to solve these problems. We have conducted experiments using NFTAPE with several types of lightweight fault injectors, including driver-based, debugger-based, target-specific, simulation-based, hardware-based, and performance-fault injections. Two example experiments are described in this paper. The first uses a hardware fault injector with a Myrinet LAN; the other uses a Software Implemented Fault Injection (SWIFI) fault injector to target a space-imaging application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839467/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6552213","conferenceDate":"27-29 March 2000","publicationDate":"2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"NFTAPE: a framework for assessing dependability in distributed systems with lightweight fault injectors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NFTAPE: a framework for assessing dependability in distributed systems with lightweight fault injectors","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00839467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044033S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6773","citationCount":"98","articleId":"839467","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":839470,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In statistical image segmentation, the model is generally defined by the probability distribution of the class field, which is assumed to be a Markov field, and the probability distributions of the observations field conditional to the class field. In such models the segmentation of textured images is difficult to perform and one has to resort to some model approximations. The originality of our contribution is to consider the Markovianity of the pair (class field observations field). We obtain a different model; in particular, the class field is not necessarily a Markov field. The model proposed makes possible the use of Bayesian methods like MPM or MAP to segment textured images with no model approximations. In addition, the textured images can be corrupted with correlated noise. Some first simulations to validate the model proposed are also presented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAI.2000.839581","publicationTitle":"4th IEEE Southwest Symposium on Image Analysis and Interpretation","displayPublicationTitle":"4th IEEE Southwest Symposium on Image Analysis and Interpretation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6776/18128/00839581.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"110","doi":"10.1109/IAI.2000.839581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pairwise Markov random fields and its application in textured images segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","displayDocTitle":"Pairwise Markov random fields and its application in textured images segmentation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2000","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6644294","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839581/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pairwise Markov random fields and its application in textured images segmentation","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00839581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033842S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6776","citationCount":"18","articleId":"839581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":839610,"authors":[{"name":"Lena Chang","affiliation":["Department of Merchant Marine, National Taiwan Ocean University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Lena Chang","id":"37278239400"},{"name":"Ching-Min Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Merchant Marine, National Taiwan Ocean University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Min Cheng","id":"37277346400"},{"name":"Ting-Chung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Merchant Marine, National Taiwan Ocean University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ting-Chung Chen","id":"37438604400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-0595-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"839610","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Multispectral imaging","Image coding","Covariance matrix","Decorrelation","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Satellites","Bandwidth","Clouds","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","adaptive signal processing","spectral analysis","correlation methods","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive Karhunen-Loeve transform","multispectral image compression","spectral correlation","spatial correlation","local terrain characteristics","image regions","simulation","performance"]}],"abstract":"In the study, we present an efficient adaptive Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) algorithm for multispectral image compression.

A fundamental problem in the image formation is phase ambiguity, i.e., it is impossible to distinguish between phases that differ by 2/spl pi/. Phase unwrapping in two dimensions essentially consists of detecting the pixel locations of the phase discontinuities, finding an ordering among the pixel locations for unwrapping the phase, and adding offsets of multiples of 2/spl pi/. In this paper, we propose a new method for detecting phase discontinuities. The method is based on a supervised feedforward multilayer perceptron neural network. We train and test the neural network on simulated phase images formed in an ODT system. For the ODT phase images, the new method detects the correct unwrapping locations where some conventional methods fail. The key contribution of the paper is a one-pass pixel-parallel low-complexity method for detecting phase discontinuities.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional phase unwrapping using neural networks","publicationTitle":"4th IEEE Southwest Symposium on Image Analysis and Interpretation","doi":"10.1109/IAI.2000.839615","displayPublicationTitle":"4th IEEE Southwest Symposium on Image Analysis and Interpretation","pdfPath":"/iel5/6776/18128/00839615.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAI.2000.839615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18128","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=839615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2000","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional phase unwrapping using neural networks","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6644326","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional phase unwrapping using neural networks","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00839615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044388S","chronDate":"2000","isNumber":"18128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6776","citationCount":"15","articleId":"839615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":839635,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

Cache memory is important; it bridges the gap in capabilities between the CPU and main memory. CPUs have been rapidly getting faster. Cache memory has advanced considerably since Wilkes in 1965 proposed a two-level main store: one conventional and the other unconventional \"slave\" memory. It has now become a conventional component of high speed computing, with increasing sophistication and size. The performance of cache is critical to overall system processing ability and the ongoing research in this area is attempting to reduce as much as possible the speed gap between the CPU and the memory.","doi":"10.1109/45.839642","publicationTitle":"IEEE Potentials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Potentials","pdfPath":"/iel5/45/18156/00839642.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/45.839642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cache memories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=839642","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr/May 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr/May 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839642/","displayDocTitle":"Cache memories","volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April-May 2000","accessionNumber":"6585598","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cache memories","sourcePdf":"00839642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031304S","chronDate":"Apr/May 2000","isNumber":"18156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"45","citationCount":"5","articleId":"839642","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":839645,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In particular, when moment-matching methods are applied to generating a reduced order model for interconnect which exhibits skin effects, the generated models have many more states than necessary.

Special software tools must be used for the design of high-performance VLSI systems. Furthermore, larger and faster systems require larger and more accurate circuit models. The partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) technique is used for modeling such systems with three-dimensional full wave models. In this paper, we present a practical, readily parallelizable procedure for generating reduced-order frequency-domain models from general full wave PEEC systems. We use multiple expansion points, and piecemeal construction of pole-residue approximations to transfer functions of the PEEC systems, as was used in the complex frequency hopping algorithms. We consider general, multiple-input/multiple-output PEEC systems. Our block procedure consists of an outer loop of local approximations to the PEEC system, coupled with an inner loop where an iterative model-reduction method is applied to the local approximations. We systematically divide the complex frequency region of interest into small regions and construct local approximations to the PEEC system in each subregion. The local approximations are constructed so that the matrix factorizations associated with each of them are the size of the original system and independent of the order of the approximation. Results of computations on these local systems are combined to obtain a reduced-order model for the original PEEC system. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach with three interesting examples.","doi":"10.1109/82.839662","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/18147/00839662.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.839662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18147","startPage":"261","endPage":"273","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for reduced-order modeling and simulation of large interconnect circuits and its application to PEEC models with retardation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=839662","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A method for reduced-order modeling and simulation of large interconnect circuits and its application to PEEC models with retardation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839662/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6588009","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for reduced-order modeling and simulation of large interconnect circuits and its application to PEEC models with retardation","sourcePdf":"00839662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09811S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"18147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"53","articleId":"839662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":839664,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The proposed multilevel multipoint model-reduction algorithm combines the merits of recently proposed Krylov-space techniques and block complex frequency-hopping to generate compact time-domain macromodels. The method overcomes the difficulty of slower transient simulation caused by redundant poles in reduced-order models obtained by Krylov-space methods. Also, it provides an efficient means to translate Krylov-space-based reduced models of distributed/measured networks with frequency-dependent descriptions into time-domain macromodels. In addition, a strategy to preserve the passivity of macromodels during multilevel reduction is presented. An important advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it can directly handle distributed stamps such as transmission lines described by Telegrapher's equations, frequency-dependent parameters, full-wave, and measured subnetworks.","doi":"10.1109/82.839664","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/18147/00839664.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.839664","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18147","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=839664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive interconnect reduction algorithm for distributed/measured networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Passive interconnect reduction algorithm for distributed/measured networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839664/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 2000","volume":"47","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 2000","accessionNumber":"6588011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive interconnect reduction algorithm for distributed/measured networks","sourcePdf":"00839664.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036611S","chronDate":"Apr 2000","isNumber":"18147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"78","articleId":"839664","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":839665,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It is fabricated in a 0.8 /spl mu/m double-poly complementary bipolar process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-9 Feb. 2000","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-9 Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6629427","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 14b 100MSample/s 3-stage A/D converter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 14b 100MSample/s 3-stage A/D converter","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00839679.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032619S","chronDate":"9-9 Feb. 2000","isNumber":"18154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6780","citationCount":"9","articleId":"839679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":839680,"authors":[{"name":"Myung-Jun Choe","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Myung-Jun Choe","id":"37305463400"},{"name":"Bang-Sun Song","affiliation":["Intersil Semiconductor, Melbourne, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Bang-Sun Song","id":"37274662800"},{"name":"K.

With a fully differential 1.5 b/stage architecture, the D/A subconverters can in principle be inherently linear, and the main limitation stems from the interstage gain accuracy. Besides the error caused by finite-op-amp gain and capacitor mismatch, the linear portion of the incomplete op-amp settling can also be modeled as an interstage gain error. One way to compensate for interstage gain errors is to adjust the reference voltage from each stage to the next so that the ratio of the reference in one stage to the corresponding value in the previous stage is equal to 1+/spl epsi/, where /spl epsi/ is the gain error between the stages. This pipelined ADC uses monolithic calibration to adjust the reference voltages of the first two stages in the background during normal ADC operation to compensate for gain errors in the first two interstage amplifiers. Calibration is potentially useful even at an 8b level because it allows the use of small capacitors and low op-amp gain, reducing power dissipation and the minimum required supply voltage and increasing the maximum speed in a given technology. The key contributions here are the use of background calibration to improve the linearity of a pipelined ADC and the implementation of these techniques with the ADC on one CMOS IC.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Voltage","Linearity","Operational amplifiers","Redundancy","Capacitors","Power dissipation","CMOS technology","CMOS process","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipeline processing","analogue-digital conversion","calibration","low-power electronics","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined ADC","background calibration","reference voltage","monolithic calibration","gain errors","power dissipation","linearity","CMOS","8 bit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839683","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

In typical implementations, error sources are capacitor ratio mismatch, op-amp gain, and residue settling. All these affect ADC performance adversely, specifically in high-speed ADCs. Capacitor matching improves as capacitor size increases, but the trend is towards shrinking capacitor size for high-speed conversion. Many innovations to overcome this such as ratio-independent techniques are reported. Among them, capacitor error-averaging offers an advantage of achieving both INL and DNL improvements over that achievable by capacitor matching, but it requires three clock phases-one extra clock phase for averaging capacitor errors. In this work, the one extra clock phase is used advantageously for comparison.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-9 Feb. 2000","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-9 Feb. 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"2000","accessionNumber":"6629433","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 14 b 20 MSample/s CMOS pipelined ADC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 14 b 20 MSample/s CMOS pipelined ADC","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00839685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049202S","chronDate":"9-9 Feb. 2000","isNumber":"18154","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6780","citationCount":"6","articleId":"839685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":839687,"authors":[{"name":"Y.M.

In order to satisfy increasing demands for data, fiber systems will employ several wavelengths carrying 40 Gb/s data in the near future. The requirements for such systems dictate that the DEMUX handle at least 4 channels of 10 Gb/s SONET/SDH data. The challenge is to build a 1:4 DEMUX that is both manufacturable and cost-effective to be integrated onto a receiver board. The authors describe a monolithic four-channel DEMUX for 40 Gb/s applications which uses an AlInAs/InGaAs HBT technology from a commercial foundry. Measurements demonstrate 40 Gb/s operation for 0.3 Vpp single-ended data input and 0.6 Vpp differential clock input.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839693","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Digital FIR filters are scalable with technology and can be adapted to provide a desired channel response typically using the least mean square (LMS) algorithm in commercial read channels. For these reasons, use of continuous time filters for this application is gradually diminishing. Efficient timing recovery in a read channel is critical for fast phase and frequency acquisition in addition to acceptable bit error rate (BER) performance. Therefore, it is also critical that these filters are implemented with as little latency as possible since their output is used to extract timing information.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Digital filters","Magnetic recording","Timing","Bit error rate","Least squares approximation","Frequency","Information filtering","Information filters","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic recording","FIR filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FIR digital filter","magnetic recording read channel","PRML equalization","signal spectral shaping","least mean square algorithm","bit error rate","timing recovery"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839700","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Since there is no gain in the present DRAM cell, it requires a large cell-capacitor to produce an adequate sense signal. In each new memory generation, structure and fabrication have become more complicated to maintain a large capacitor while miniaturizing the cell. This phase-state low electron-number drive memory (PLEDM) gain cell uses a stacked tunnel transistor (PLEDTR). Since this cell has gain, a large capacitor is not necessary. The cell size is 5F/sup 2/ where F is the minimum feature size. Its read and write times are simulated as 20ns and 5ns, respectively. In principle, it is possible with PLEDM to have a retention time longer than 10 years, enabling a nonvolatile memory to be realised.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839719","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

In addition, when external hyper-abrupt varactors are used, a separate high-voltage supply (e.g. 30 V) is required to cover the entire frequency band. More recently, integrated wideband tuners have been reported using multiple wideband RC oscillators, but they require a complicated multi-loop architecture to achieve desired phase-noise performance. Using multiple integrated LC voltage-controlled oscillators (VCO) (including resonators) a fully-integrated single-loop frequency synthesizer is possible which allows the development of a single-chip solution for broadband applications. This results in a significant cost reduction and ease of system-board design.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839722","startPage":"140","endPage":"141","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

The front-end converts the RF signal into a differential I and Q signal, centered at an 100 kHz IF. The cascode LNA is input-matched using an on-chip spiral inductor. The measured S11 is <-11.5 dB between 1.725 GHz and 1.975 GHz, satisfying the antenna filter requirement (S11 <-10 dB). The lower input impedance improves the LNA gain by about 1.5 dB compared to an exact 50 /spl Omega/ match. An on-chip load inductor centers the gain at 1.84 GHz. Each down-conversion mixer uses a cascoded, current-folding switching mixer. This permits low voltage operation while enabling the insertion of a cascode transistor to improve LO leakage and mixer linearity. The noise contribution of the top current source is reduced by the pMOS bleeder. The VGA consists of a two-stage fully differential OTA with a bank of highly matched, RC elements. Its gain can progressively be decreased by 6 dB by switching them in parallel.

The limiting amplifier (LA) receives a small-non-return to zero (NRZ) voltage signal (e.g., 8 mV/sub pp/) from the transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and amplifies it to a level (e.g. 250 mV/sub pp/) sufficient for the reliable operation of the clock and data recovery circuit. The noise contribution of the LA must be small compared to that of the TIA so that the overall bit error rate and sensitivity are not affected adversely. Currently, commercial 2.5 Gb/s SONET systems are composed of several discrete chips implemented in GaAs and more recently silicon bipolar technology. The future trend, however, is to integrate most of the front-end together with the digital framer on a single CMOS chip. Furthermore, the integration of multiple 2.5 Gb/s channels on a single CMOS chip is desirable for wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) application. CMOS amplifiers for optical receivers and related applications with bandwidths up to 2.1 GHz are recently reported. This CMOS limiting amplifier with improved bandwidth (3 GHz) and noise figure (16 dB) is suitable for 2.5 Gb/s SONET receivers. Power dissipation is 53 mW and the chip is fabricated in a standard 2.5 V, 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS technology. This result is achieved with: (i) Inverse scaling to increase gain-bandwidth and reduce power dissipation while keeping noise and offset voltage low and (ii) active inductors to increase gain-bandwidth and improve gain stability. The active area of the amplifier is 0.03 mm/sup 2/, less than 10% that of a comparable design with spiral inductors.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839730","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839730","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

However, owing to complex loop characteristic and precision required for analog blocks, the design is not simple. All digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) achieved 50-cycle acquisition time by sweeping the whole tuning range through a modified binary search. Due to a fixed sweeping algorithm, acquisition time is independent of VCO free-running frequency. Also, adaptive gear-shifting phase-locked loop (AGPLL) brings acquisition time within 40 cycles by adjusting the loop bandwidth proportional to the input phase differences. In spite of poor jitter performance, digital implementations have started to draw more attention since they yield better testability, programmability, stability, and transplantation over various processes. In this work the authors present a digitally controlled phase-locked loop (DCPLL) which reduces acquisition time by utilizing a digital frequency-difference detector (DFDD). Whereas the arbiter of the ADPLL generates only binary results of 'fast' or 'slow', the DFDD supports the functions of measuring frequency difference and an arbiter. Thereby, the DCPLL acquisition time is reduced compared to that of the ADPLL, while its locking performance remains independent of free-running frequency. A prototype DCPLL has been implemented in a 0.6 /spl mu/m triple metal CMOS process.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839734","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Using copper and wider wires for major signal and power/ground lines, inductive impedance (j/spl omega/L) could become comparable to the resistive component of the wire (R). Due to the inductance, delay increases, over-shoot occurs, and inductive crosstalk can no longer be ignored. Inductive effects were recently demonstrated in 4 mm-long lines in a 0.25 /spl mu/m process. The extracted delays of a typical clock line from this test chip are shown. While the delay is a linear function of line length, the RC delay increases with the square of the line length. As a result, the inductive effects are actually more prominent for lines with intermediate lengths. The inductive effects for the intermediate length buses as well as local clocks must be considered. As technology is scaled, the gate delay time will continue to be reduced while the delay of short, low-resistive clock lines will remain constant. The inductive effects will therefore become prominent for progressively short lines. The article shows simulated inductance effects on crosstalk. Larger coupling and ringing effects are observed when inductive coupling is included in the simulation. Currently, the inductive effects are only considered for a few global clocks and buses, which is insufficient for future designs. Although 3D electromagnetic full wave solvers are available, they cannot manage the complexity of today's integrated circuits. To model the inductive effects of intermediate-length buses as well as local clocks, a fast automated inductance extraction and verification tool is necessary.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839736","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

In this configuration, the analog signal from the CCD must be driven across a flexible cable to the main board, where analog pre-processing is performed. In previous camera generations, the challenge was simply to integrate all of the analog functions onto a single CMOS chip compatible with low voltage supplies. This results in low-cost low-power system partitioning now widely used for consumer CCD camera systems. As consumer CCD sensors move toward higher resolution, however, this conventional integration has weaknesses. This paper shows a modified analog front-end integration for high-speed CCD interface to overcome the problems of conventional partitioning.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video equipment","Charge coupled devices","Charge-coupled image sensors","Optical signal processing","Packaging","High speed optical techniques","Optical sensors","Lenses","Video signal processing","CMOS image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCD image sensors","video cameras","analogue processing circuits","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analog front-end chip-set","camcorder","CCD video camera","signal processing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839744","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

The 802.11 wireless LAN standard, the Bluetooth radio connectivity protocol, and the HomeRF SWAP home networking protocol all specify frequency hopping radios in the 2.4 GHz band using FSK modulation in a 1 MHz bandwidth. These standards require modest radio performance (compared to cellular systems), but demand small size and low cost. This paper describes a CMOS /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ fractional-N (/spl Sigma//spl Delta/FN) frequency synthesizer. In contrast to prior art, its 700 kHz bandwidth type-1 phase-locked loop (PLL) enables sub-5 /spl mu/s frequency hops plus 2- and 4-level digital Gaussian frequency shift keying (GFSK) modulation at 1 or 2 Mb/s.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency synthesizers","Frequency shift keying","Wireless application protocol","Bandwidth","Phase locked loops","Radio communication","Communication standards","Wireless LAN","Bluetooth","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","sigma-delta modulation","frequency hop communication","frequency shift keying","frequency synthesizers","phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["settling time","closed loop modulation","CMOS sigma-delta fractional-N frequency synthesizer","phase locked loop","digital Gaussian frequency shift keying modulation","frequency hopping radio communication","2.5 GHz","5 mus","2 Mbit/s","700 kHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839748","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

One approach to this problem is to integrate the RF functionality in low-cost CMOS technology together with the baseband transceiver functions. This in turn requires integration of the frequency synthesizer with enough isolation from supply noise to allow it to coexist with other on-chip transceiver circuitry and still meet the phase noise performance requirements of the application. This differential synthesizer for block-down-convert receivers achieves improved levels of phase noise and supply rejection performance through the use of fully-differential architecture and a wide-bandwidth PLL.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1.4 GHz differential low-noise CMOS frequency synthesizer using a wideband PLL architecture","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

In many applications, e.g., in biomedicine or machine vision, only cameras with a single charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor can satisfy the stringent space requirements. Reconstruction of the RGB image from the CCD with Bayer color filter array (CFA) requires an extremely high computation effort if reasonable frame rates and artifact-free interpolation quality is to be achieved. An application specific IC (ASIC) performs this task for 1024 by 1024 pixels at 30 frames per second.

Low power consumption and low cost are also essential for consumer applications. These requirements are supported by multi-channel transmission, such as four 5 Gb/s CMOS LSIs, which is an effective approach to achieving an aggregate bandwidth of 20 Gb/s. There are two system problems in developing a multi-channel transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) LSIs. One is the phase difference between multiple chips due to the data skew caused by differences between transmission cable lengths. The other is the frequency difference between the TX and RX system clocks. In response to these problems, we have developed compensation technology featuring the use of an elastic buffer for both the phase and frequency differences. Moreover, to achieve 6 Gb/s operation, a self-alignment phase detector with parallel output for a high-speed clock and data recovery circuit (CDR) and a 500 MHz fully pipelined 8B10B encoder are developed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18154","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Using memory cells as the reference cells provides an optimum reference voltage level, which automatically tracks the main memory cell properties. However, when memory cells are used as reference cells, the reference cells experience more access cycling than normal cells. Therefore, the endurance of the FRAM devices is determined by reference cells rather than by normal cells. Another issue is that, when the memory cells are used as reference cells, reference voltage level fluctuation cannot be avoided, especially in high-density FRAM, because variations of PZT film grain size and dimensions of the capacitor become serious. A variable reference bit line voltage scheme overcomes these problems. Unfortunately, the reference bit-line voltage scheme is not useful for all memory cells, because the reference voltage level is determined by a limited number of cells, not by all memory cells. This bit-line reference scheme is optimized with all of the memory cell charge information. Data protection is also used for unintentional power-off.

Interlocked pipelined CMOS (IPCMOS), an asynchronous clocking technique, helps address these challenges. This paper shows how a typical block (e.g., Block D) is interlocked with all the blocks with which it interacts. In the forward direction, dedicated Valid signals emulate the worst-case path through each driving block and thus determine when data can be latched within the typical block. In the reverse direction, Acknowledge signals indicate that data has been received by the subsequent blocks and that new data may be processed within the typical block. In this interlocked approach local clocks are generated only when there is an operation to perform.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839786","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

A potential application is wireless clock distribution, proposed as an alternative interconnect system capable of distributing high frequency clock signals at the speed of light using microwaves. The wireless clock distribution system consists of a clock transmitter, located on or off chip, broadcasting a microwave global clock signal at frequencies greater than 15 GHz, and a grid of integrated clock receivers. The global clock signal is received using an integrated dipole antenna. The signal is then amplified using a low-noise amplifier (LNA), frequency divided down to the local clock frequency, buffered, and distributed to provide local clock signals. This IC operating at 7.4 GHz, which integrates antennas and necessary receiver circuits in 0.25 /spl mu/m CMOS with five metal layers on p-substrates, is a first step towards realizing such a system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

The paper shows a block diagram of a highly-integrated AM/FM radio receiver. The IF A/D conversion and digital filtering, demodulation and further signal processing can be integrated on a single CMOS IC. The radio front-end mixes both AM and FM signals to 10.7 MHz IF, so that the A/D conversion is shared. A single channel filter is used, selecting one 200 kHz FM channel. For AM, over 20 channels pass through this filter, resulting in high dynamic range of the IF signal. When the radio is tuned to a weak AM radio station, strong neighboring channels should not introduce disturbance of the weak signal. This multi-channel aspect for AM puts severe requirements on the automatic gain control (AGC) amplifier and A/D converter in terms of noise, intermodulation and crossmodulation distortion.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are also used but their jitter is larger than that of DLLs, because DLLs have no jitter accumulation. However, conventional DLLs have design problems. One is that their phase capture ranges are limited, and another is that a special reset sequence is required. Dual DLL architectures are developed to overcome these problems. In these architectures, the latency from the input to the output, however, is lengthened to attain high resolution, because these architectures require a number of multiplexers between the DLL input and output ports. As a result, supply-noise induced jitter increases. To reduce the jitter, a portable digital DLL uses the following techniques: (1) a master-slave architecture, which achieves infinite phase capture ranges and eliminates the special reset requirement, (2) a wave synchronous latch circuit, which maintains high resolution, and (3) a dynamic phase detector, which improves phase comparison sensitivity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1 GHz portable digital delay-locked loop with infinite phase capture ranges","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

A matched filter like this can be viewed as a finite impulse response (FIR) filter with a PN sequence used as the binary tap weights, minimizing search and synchronization times in DS-CDMA receivers. This paper introduces an approach for implementing matched filters based on recycling integrator correlators (RICs) that use a sensible combination of analog and digital processing to minimize area and power consumption. The matched filter is organized by combining an array of RICs, a cyclic shift register which stores a PN sequence, and a rotary multiplexer which transfers the correlation values one by one. This implementation provides: 1) an input analog signal processing capability without the need of a fast ADC; 2) an already digitally-coded output stream; 3) small capacitor ratios for the switched-capacitor (SC) integrators; and 4) minimum die-area and current consumption for the available technology and the spreading ratio, that is, the length of the PN sequence. The fabrication process is a 0.35 /spl mu/m CMOS double-metal, double-poly process. The chip occupies 22.8 mm/sup 2/ and dissipates 23 mW with a 1.8 V power supply.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 23 mW 256-tap 8 MSample/s QPSK matched filter for DS-CDMA cellular telephony using recycling integrator correlators","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

Mixed-signal decoders are recently employed in applications to capture the potential of smaller size, higher speed or lower power consumption when compared to an equivalent digital implementation.

The 0.5 V operation results from using two circuit techniques. One is an LC-tuned folded Gilbert cell, and the other is the use of undoped MOSFETs in the VCO core and buffers for the mixer and VCO. SOI devices have excellent RF performance even at voltages below 1V because of reduced capacitance in the drain region compared to bulk-CMOS technologies. Moreover, fully-depleted CMOS/SIMOX technology allows undoped MOSFETs with no process steps added to the normal digital CMOS/SIMOX LSI fabrication. The undoped MOSFETs are normally-on transistors and can be made simply by masking in the channel-doping process. Thus, they have the same structure as normal (doped) ones except for the impurity concentration in their channel region. They do not show punch-through current even in short-channel devices. This is because the potential of their thin-film channel region is perfectly controlled by the gate. The undoped MOSFETs are effective in designing RF circuits that operate at 0.5 V.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","CMOS technology","MOSFETs","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Silicon on insulator technology","Voltage","Thin film circuits","CMOS process","Circuit noise","Low-noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio receivers","circuit tuning","low-power electronics","UHF amplifiers","UHF mixers","UHF oscillators","voltage-controlled oscillators","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","SIMOX","MMIC amplifiers","MMIC mixers","MMIC oscillators","field effect MMIC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF front-end circuits","LC-tuned folded Gilbert cell","supply voltage","low-power RF circuits","low noise amplifier","downconversion mixer","voltage-controlled oscillator","fully-depleted CMOS/SIMOX technology","undoped MOSFETs","normally-on transistors","channel-doping process","impurity concentration","UHF receivers","0.5 to 1 V","2 GHz","0.2 micron"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839823","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

The fast random cycle low-latency embedded RAM macro reported here uses a dual-port interleaved DRAM architecture (D/sup 2/RAM). D/sup 2/RAM reduces random cycle time from 50 ns (20 MHz) of conventional DRAM to 8 ns (125 MHz) on a test chip with a 0.25 /spl mu/m embedded DRAM process. Key technologies are (1) interleaved open bitline operation with dual-port memory cell architecture, (2) two-stage pipelined circuit operation and (3) write before sensing (WBS).","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839829","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

To enhance cost-efficiency, 2 page sizes are offered in one chip, ensuring suitability for widespread use: 1 kB for low-end computers requiring low power consumption and 2 kB for high-end workstations. This 288 Mb RDRAM contains four 72 Mb quadrants, in the center of which row decoders (XDECs) are located horizontally. Column decoders (YDECs) are at the edge of each quadrant near the chip center. For the 2/spl times/16 split, dependent bank, bank0 through bank15 and bank16 through bank31 function the same as the dependent bank. Bank15 and bank16 are, however, independent of each other. The same bank resides in 2 quadrants positioned diagonally. Both leftand right-hand halves (36 Mb units) of each quadrant contain 16 banks which are arranged as 16 vertical strips. In each unit, sense amplifiers (SAs) are shared between adjacent strips. 34 global bank-select-lines (GBSLs) corresponding to the vertical rows of SAs and 36 Main DQ Lines (MDQs) run horizontally over the array in half of each quadrant divided by XDECs along with column-select-lines (CSLs). MDQs are connected to the second sense amplifiers (SSAs) placed vertically at the chip center and shared between the left- and right-hand halves of the chip. Beside the SSAs, the shift registers (SRs) for 8 to 1 parallel-serial conversion are arranged vertically and transfer 144b to 18 I/O pads every column access.","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

This imbalance requires memory systems to use a wide data-bus and/or a high-speed I/O interface to increase access speed. Increasing access speed with a wide data-bus is studied, but is practically limited by memory pin counts. Alternatively, Rambus DRAM (RDRAM) achieves access speed up to 800 MB/s in a well-controlled printed circuit board (PCB) environment by adopting a high-speed I/O interface. Low cost systems use synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) interface because they cannot afford a high-cost PCB. This system limits memory access speed to the system clock speed, which is commonly less than 100 MHz. Double data rate (DDR) SDRAM, is twice as fast as SDRAM memory access by taking both rising and falling edges of the system clock, while keeping the SDRAM interface. To deal with clock skew, the DDR SDRAM provides an extra strobe signal for the receiving end.","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

In the on-chip memory system, both bandwidth and latency are scaled. Keys to scaling memory latency are a sum-addressed memory data cache, which allows the average memory latency to scale by more than the clock ratio, and the use of a prefetch data cache. Memory bandwidth is improved by using wave-pipelined SRAM designs for on-chip caches and a write cache for store traffic. The chip operates at 800 MHz and dissipates <60 W from a 1.5 V supply. It contains 23 M transistors (12 M in RAM cells) on a 244mm/sup 2/ die. This paper contrasts this 7-metal-layer-aluminum, 0.15 /spl mu/m CMOS design with the previous generations designs. To deal with the growing microprocessor complexity, more aggressive circuit-techniques, interconnect delay optimization, crosstalk reduction, improved power and clock distribution schemes, and better thermal management are used.","displayPublicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

The requirement comes from the stringent in-band blocking characteristics in the GSM standard. Based on the reference sensitivity, the blocking requirement, and the assumption of C/I=9 dB, the calculated phase noise specifications are summarized in this paper. Because typical VCO phase noise roll-off around 1MHz offset has a slope of 20 dB or 30 dB per decade, the key specifications are at offsets of 600 MHz and 3 MHz for Mobile Station (MS) and 800 kHz for Base Transceiver Station (BTS). The table is sorted by the difficulty of the requirement, with the easiest (DCS 1800 MS) on the left and the most stringent (GSM 900 BTS) on the right.","doi":"10.1109/ISSCC.2000.839847","publicationTitle":"2000 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference.

In FRAM, a reference voltage design using a ferroelectric capacitor is difficult because of the degradation due to fatigue, a chip-to-chip variation, and a temperature dependence. A variable reference voltage scheme is generated to solve this problem, boosting a fatigue-free and temperature-independent MOS reference capacitance by a driver. The driver is operated from a compact reference voltage generator that provides 32 equally divided voltages and occupies only half the layout area of a conventional one. During sense operation, memory-cell capacitance C/sub ferr/ is larger than reference-cell capacitance C/sub MOS/. A double word-line pulse scheme has also been developed to eliminate a bit-line capacitance imbalance in the bit-line pairs, where a memory cell and a reference cell are separated from the bit-line pairs during sense operation. A six-order improvement in imprint lifetime has been achieved by the new scheme.","doi":"10.1109/4.839914","startPage":"545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/18159/00839914.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.839914","endPage":"551","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 0.5-/spl mu/m, 3-V 1T1C, 1-Mbit FRAM with a variable reference bit-line voltage scheme using a fatigue-free reference capacitor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839914/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2000","displayDocTitle":"A 0.5-/spl mu/m, 3-V 1T1C, 1-Mbit FRAM with a variable reference bit-line voltage scheme using a fatigue-free reference capacitor","volume":"35","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6601064","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 0.5-/spl mu/m, 3-V 1T1C, 1-Mbit FRAM with a variable reference bit-line voltage scheme using a fatigue-free reference capacitor","sourcePdf":"00839914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028454S","chronDate":"April  2000","isNumber":"18159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"16","articleId":"839914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":839915,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Roughly, the systems we study are composed of an uncontrollable part (the \"object\") and a controlled one (the \"robot\"), linked by a unilateral constraint and an impact rule. A systematic and general control design method for this class of systems is proposed. The approach is a nontrivial extension of the one degree-of-freedom (DOF) juggler control design. In addition to the robot control, it is also useful to study some intermediate controllability properties of the object's impact Poincare mapping, which generally takes the form of a nonlinear discrete-time system. The force input mainly consists of a family of dead-beat feedback control laws, introduced via a recursive procedure, and exploiting the underlying discrete-time structure of the system.

The JPDA, however, tends to coalesce neighboring tracks and ignores the coupling between those tracks. Fitzgerald (1990) has shown that hypothesis pruning may be an effective way to prevent track coalescence. Unfortunately, this process leads to an undesired sensitivity to clutter and missed detections, and it does not support any coupling. To improve this situation, the paper follows a novel approach to combine the advantages of JPDA coupling, and hypothesis pruning into new algorithms. First, the problem of multiple target tracking is embedded into one filtering for a linear descriptor system with stochastic coefficients. Next, for this descriptor system, the exact Bayesian and new JPDA filters are derived. Finally, through Monte Carlo simulations, it is shown that these new PDA filters are able to handle coupling and are insensitive to track coalescence, clutter, and missed detections.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Bayesian methods","Gaussian processes","Filtering","Nearest neighbor searches","Gaussian approximation","Nonlinear filters","Stochastic systems","Neural networks","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target tracking","Monte Carlo methods","filtering theory","Bayes methods","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple targets tracking","hypothesis pruning","linear descriptor system","stochastic coefficients","exact Bayesian filter","Monte Carlo simulations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/9.839947","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/18161/00839947.pdf","startPage":"247","endPage":"259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.839947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic data association avoiding track coalescence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=839947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic data association avoiding track coalescence","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839947/","volume":"45","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6585949","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic data association avoiding track coalescence","sourcePdf":"00839947.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057817S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"86","articleId":"839947","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":839949,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Our main result exploits a linear matrix inequality (LMI) characterization involving scalings and Lyapunov variables subject to an additional essentially nonconvex algebraic constraint. The nonconvexity enters the problem in the form of a rank deficiency condition or matrix inverse relation on the scalings only. It is shown that such problems, but also more generally rank inequalities and bilinear constraints, can be formulated as the minimization of a concave functional subject to LMI constraints. First of all, a local Frank and Wolfe (1956) feasible direction algorithm is introduced in this context to tackle this hard optimization problem. Exploiting the attractive concavity structure of the problem, several efficient global concave programming methods are then introduced and combined with the local feasible direction method to secure and certify global optimality of the solutions. Computational experiments indicate the viability of our algorithms, and in the worst case, they require the solution of a few LMI programs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/18161/00839953.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"305","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/9.839953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.839953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=839953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust control via concave minimization local and global algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Minimization methods","Linear matrix inequalities","Constraint theory","Constraint optimization","Uncertain systems","Uncertainty","Time varying systems","Linear programming","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying systems","robust control","matrix algebra","optimal control","uncertain systems","Lyapunov methods","concave programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust control","local concave minimization","global concave minimization","linear fractional representation","LFT uncertain systems","time-varying parameter uncertainty","linear matrix inequality","LMI","Lyapunov variables","scalings","rank deficiency condition","matrix inverse relation","rank inequalities","bilinear constraints","feasible direction algorithm","concavity structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","displayDocTitle":"Robust control via concave minimization local and global algorithms","volume":"45","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6585955","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust control via concave minimization local and global algorithms","sourcePdf":"00839953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043797S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"81","articleId":"839953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":839954,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

The problem under consideration amounts to determining the minimal tracking error between the output and reference signals of a feedback system, attainable by all possible stabilizing compensators. An integral square error criterion is used as a measure for the tracking error, and explicit expressions are derived for this minimal tracking error with respect to step reference signals. It is shown that plant nonminimum phase zeros have a negative effect on a feedback system's ability to reduce the tracking error, and that in a multivariable system this effect results in a way depending on not only the zero locations, but also the zero directions. It is also shown that if unity feedback structure is used for tracking purposes, plant nonminimum phase zeros and unstable poles can together play a particularly detrimental role in the achievable tracking performance, especially when the zeros and poles are nearby and their directions are closely aligned. On the other hand, if a two parameter controller structure is used, the achievable tracking performance depends only on the plant nonminimum phase zeros.","doi":"10.1109/9.839960","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/18161/00839960.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.839960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limitations on maximal tracking accuracy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=839960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839960/","displayDocTitle":"Limitations on maximal tracking accuracy","volume":"45","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2000","accessionNumber":"6585962","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limitations on maximal tracking accuracy","sourcePdf":"00839960.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029124S","chronDate":"Feb 2000","isNumber":"18161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"137","articleId":"839960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":839972,"authors":[{"name":"C.D.

The GER is a mathematical relation, which if satisfied, often facilitates closed-form analysis of adaptive processors employing estimated covariances subject to inhomogeneities. The goal of this paper is to determine what impact this constraint has on the integrity of the adaptive nulling process. In order to examine the impact of the GER constraint on adaptive nulling, we establish fundamental statistical convergence properties of an adaptive null for the sample covariance-based (SCB) minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer. Novel exact expressions relating the mean and variance of an adaptive null of a homogeneously trained beamformer to the mean and variance of a nonhomogeneous trained beamformer are derived. In addition, it is shown that the Reed et al. (1974) result for required sample support can be highly inaccurate under nonhomogeneous conditions. Indeed, the required sample support can at times depend directly on the power of the undernulled interference.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistics of adaptive nulling and use of the generalized eigenrelation (GER) for modeling inhomogeneities in adaptive processing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.839974","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/18164/00839974.pdf","startPage":"1263","endPage":"1273","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.839974","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18164","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=839974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839974/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2000","displayDocTitle":"Statistics of adaptive nulling and use of the generalized eigenrelation (GER) for modeling inhomogeneities in adaptive processing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 2000","accessionNumber":"6608124","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistics of adaptive nulling and use of the generalized eigenrelation (GER) for modeling inhomogeneities in adaptive processing","sourcePdf":"00839974.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089426S","chronDate":"May 2000","isNumber":"18164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"28","articleId":"839974","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":839977,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Measurement and statistical models are then obtained from the associated concentration distribution. We derive two detectors (the generalized likelihood ratio (GLR) test and the mean detector) and determine their performance in terms of the probabilities of false alarm and detection. To determine the unknown location of a landmine, we derive a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation algorithm and evaluate its performance by computing the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). The results are applied to the design of chemical sensor arrays, satisfying criteria specified in terms of detection and estimation performance measures and for optimally selecting the number and positions of sensors and the number of time samples. To illustrate the potential of the proposed techniques in a realistic demining scenario, we derive a moving-sensor algorithm in which the stationary sensor array is replaced by a single moving sensor.

The results of this comparison show identical asymptotic properties of both algorithms in the case of uncorrelated sources and a better performance of unitary root-MUSIC in scenarios with partially correlated or fully coherent sources. Additionally, our simulations and the results of sonar and ultrasonic real data processing demonstrate an improved threshold performance of unitary root-MUSIC relative to conventional root-MUSIC.

Type 2 is the improved form of type 1 and can be used for other applications of digital signal processing. Meanwhile, many important properties continuous FRFT and AFT are kept in the closed-form DFRFT and DAFT, and some applications, such as filter design and pattern recognition, are also discussed.

All the architectures so far described in the literature do not explicitly address the handling of borders and usually assume a zero-padding extension. The RPA makes heavy use of this assumption, which produces very efficient systolic architectures. It is, however, well known that the zero-padding extension does not allow perfect recovery of the original signal, if we compute exactly N coefficients. More coefficients are required either in the forward or in the inverse transform, and their production within the RPA scheme lowers the efficiency of the systolic architecture to a minimum. We introduce a modified RPA working on an extended transform with a compressed schedule that restores good values of efficiency (EC-RPA). We also propose a second version of RPA based on a periodic extension of the signal and of the transform (PE-RPA) that achieves perfect reconstruction by computing exactly N DWT coefficients. A reduced version of the second algorithm (R-PE-RPA) is tailored to the efficient computations of a fixed number of levels in the transform. The VLSI complexity of the management of borders is analyzed through synthesis from a VHDL description of the three algorithms. Synthesis results show that the controller required for PE-RPA can be as large as a ten-tap array. R-PE-RPA instead requires half this area. In both cases, the controller complexity scales sublinearly with the length of the input.","doi":"10.1109/78.839983","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/18164/00839983.pdf","startPage":"1365","endPage":"1378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.839983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handling borders in systolic architectures for the 1-D discrete wavelet transform for perfect reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=839983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839983/","displayDocTitle":"Handling borders in systolic architectures for the 1-D discrete wavelet transform for perfect reconstruction","volume":"48","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2000","accessionNumber":"6608133","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handling borders in systolic architectures for the 1-D discrete wavelet transform for perfect reconstruction","sourcePdf":"00839983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059283S","chronDate":"May 2000","isNumber":"18164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"16","articleId":"839983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":839985,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Variation between the subspaces is modeled by rotating their projection matrices via the action of unitary matrices [elements of the unitary group U(n)]. Subspace estimation or tracking then corresponds to inferences on U(n). Taking a Bayesian approach, a posterior density is derived on U(n), and certain expectations under this posterior are empirically generated. For the choice of the Hilbert-Schmidt norm on U(n), to define estimation errors, an optimal MMSE estimator is derived. It is shown that this estimator achieves a lower bound on the expected squared errors associated with all possible estimators. The estimator and the bound are computed using (Metropolis-adjusted) Langevin's-diffusion algorithm for sampling from the posterior. For use in subspace tracking, a prior model on subspace rotation, that utilizes Newtonian dynamics, is suggested.","doi":"10.1109/78.839985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18164","startPage":"1390","endPage":"1400","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/18164/00839985.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.839985","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian approach to geometric subspace estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayesian methods","Signal processing algorithms","Signal processing","Application software","Vectors","Estimation error","Sampling methods","Manifolds","Monte Carlo methods","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","parameter estimation","matrix algebra","optimisation","least mean squares methods","signal sampling","group theory","array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometric subspace estimation","Bayesian approach","complex Grassmann-manifold","complex projection matrix","projection matrices","unitary matrices","unitary group elements","subspace tracking","posterior density","Hilbert-Schmidt norm","estimation errors","optimal MMSE estimator","lower bound","squared errors","Metropolis-adjusted Langevin's-diffusion algorithm","sampling","subspace rotation","Newtonian dynamics","uniform linear array","array signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2000","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian approach to geometric subspace estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839985/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 2000","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"48","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6608135","publicationDate":"May 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian approach to geometric subspace estimation","sourcePdf":"00839985.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034869S","chronDate":"May 2000","isNumber":"18164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"40","articleId":"839985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":839986,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In VSE, N bandlimited signals, all with the same bandwidth B, are passed through a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) linear time invariant system that generates M (M/spl ges/N) output signals. The goal is to reconstruct the input signals from the samples of the output signals at a total sampling rate of N times the Nyquist rate, where the Nyquist rate is B//spl pi/ samples per second. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for this reconstruction. A surprising necessary condition for the case where all output signals are uniformly sampled at the same rate (N/M times the Nyquist rate) is that the expansion factor M/N must be an integer. This condition is no longer necessary when each output signal is sampled at a different rate or sampled nonuniformly. This work also includes a noise sensitivity analysis of VSE systems. We define the noise amplification factor, which allows a quantitative comparison between VSE systems, and determine the optimal VSE systems.","doi":"10.1109/78.839986","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/18164/00839986.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.839986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18164","startPage":"1401","endPage":"1416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector sampling expansion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=839986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Vector sampling expansion","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839986/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 2000","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2000","accessionNumber":"6608136","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector sampling expansion","sourcePdf":"00839986.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037579S","chronDate":"May 2000","isNumber":"18164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"22","articleId":"839986","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":839987,"authors":[{"name":"F.

By partitioning the true channel into the mth-order significant part and the unmodeled tails, we show that the LP method furnishes an approximation to the mth-order significant part. The closeness depends on the diversity of the mth-order significant part and the size of the unmodeled tails. Furthermore, we show that two frequently encountered claims concerning the LP method, namely, that (a) the method is robust with respect to channel overmodeling and (b) the performance of the method depends critically on the size of the first impulse response term, are not correct in realistic scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/78.839996","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1477","endPage":"1481","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/18164/00839996.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.839996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=18164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the robustness of the linear prediction method for blind channel identification with respect to effective channel undermodeling/overmodeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prediction methods","Discrete wavelet transforms","Biomedical signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Tail","Wavelet analysis","Predictive models","Noise robustness","System identification","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identification","telecommunication channels","prediction theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear prediction method","blind channel identification","channel undermodeling","channel overmodeling","performance","true channel","mth-order significant part","unmodeled tails","approximation","diversity","first impulse response term"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 2000","displayDocTitle":"On the robustness of the linear prediction method for blind channel identification with respect to effective channel undermodeling/overmodeling","volume":"48","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6608146","publicationDate":"May 2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/839996/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the robustness of the linear prediction method for blind channel identification with respect to effective channel undermodeling/overmodeling","sourcePdf":"00839996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040228S","chronDate":"May 2000","isNumber":"18164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","articleId":"839996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"}]
