The minimisation of the devices offers cost reduction, compact packaging and enhanced overall reliability. With that in view, a topology with 3N/sub sc/+3 devices is chosen where N/sub sc/ is the number of sectors in the linear machine. The propulsion force with conventional control of single phase excitation has high commutation torque pulsation and it is overcome with a multiphase excitation strategy proposed in this paper. Further, the proposed control strategy reduces the normal force pulsation. A systematic step by step design procedure of the switching strategy for the converter known as unipolar switching strategy, proportional plus integral current controller and gating control strategy of a long linear switched reluctance machine are presented. Experimental correlation of the proposed converter arrangement and control strategy is presented with a 4.8 m long linear switched reluctance machine in achieving the stated objectives.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1999 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.

The power source consists of a DC ignitor connected in series with a sustaining source. The ignitor is shorted after a sustaining current is achieved, followed by the connection of a regulated pulsed current source connected in parallel with the sustaining source. The application of this lamp in rapid thermal processing systems dictates that the interpulse period of the pulsed source be made as short as possible. Experiments have been performed with and without the sustaining source. Arc overvoltage after the current is reapplied becomes larger as the interpulse period is made longer. Overvoltages are higher if no sustaining source is used during the interpulse period. An acoustic resonance is observed with a duration equal to the axial convective transit time. A sustaining source may not be required based on the results of the experiments.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1999.800014","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1999 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.

Higher carrier density in trench IGBTs results in smaller cell size and improved conduction. It is shown that this increase in the concentration of excess charges also results in inferior turn-off performance. Hard-switching performance is dominated by turnoff losses. The trench IGBT under study has higher switching losses than identically rated planar IGBT. Soft switching results in significant reduction of the turn-off stress; thus promising an increase in switching frequency till the device becomes the limiting factor once again. High switching losses of trench IGBTs may be a setback from this consideration even as conduction performance of the device improves significantly.

In this combined coding/signalling scenario the turbo coder structure is exploited for a space-time processing approach which results in an improved quality of communication. The space-time system, employing either a convolutional or turbo coding scheme, combines coding (temporal diversity), with RAKE (multipath diversity) and MRC (spatial diversity) to realize high-capacity DS/CDMA mobile communication systems. The transceiver considered employs n/sub T/ antennas at the transmitter and a single antenna at the receiver. In addition a L/sub R/-branch space-path RAKE receiver, followed by a soft-input (soft-output) channel decoder are employed. We analyze the BER performance and capacity tradeoff between various system parameters under a fixed total bandwidth expansion and error correction code complexity constraint requirements. It is shown that when turbo codes are considered, the potential for large coding gains and increased system capacity is substantial.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.800138","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

The three sonars described in this paper use acoustic lenses to form near-video-quality images. The first sonar, Limpet Mine Imaging Sonar (LIMIS), is diver-held, forms 64 beams, each with a beamwidth of 0.35/spl deg/ in the horizontal axis by 7/spl deg/ in the vertical axis. This sonar has a 20/spl deg/ field-of-view, operates at 2 MHz, has a practical range of 10 m, and forms between 5 and 12 images/second. The second sonar, Glendora Lake Acoustic Imaging System, (GLACIS), is used to monitor underwater tests and pans and tilts on a platform that can change depth. This sonar forms 64 beams, each with a beamwidth of 0.55/spl deg/ horizontal and 10/spl deg/ vertical. It has a 32/spl deg/ field of view, operates at 750 kHz, and forms 5 or 9 images/second at an operating range of 60 or 30 m, respectively. The third sonar, Acoustic Barnacle Imaging Sonar (ABIS), mounts on an ROV and forms 128 beams, each with a beamwidth of 0.25/spl deg/ horizontal by 10/spl deg/ vertical. This sonar has a 32/spl deg/ field-of-view, operates at 3 MHz, has a range between 1.8 m and 2.4 m, and forms 64 images/second. All three sonars use a set of thin, acoustic lenses made of polymethylpentene to focus sound on a 1-3 composite linear array. The acoustic lenses form beams at the speed of sound with no circuitry and thus eliminate the complexity and power consumption of conventional beamforming electronics. Two disadvantages are (1) the lenses and the spaces between the lenses add volume in front of the transducer array, and (2) multiple reflections between lens surfaces cause internal reverberation. The reverberation inside these sonars is about 40 dB down from the target echoes and scatters to form a slightly brighter background. No range-shifted \"ghosts\" of target images are seen.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/800215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6520553","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1999","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming and imaging with acoustic lenses in small, high-frequency sonars","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming and imaging with acoustic lenses in small, high-frequency sonars","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00800215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032304S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6465","citationCount":"12","articleId":"800215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":800237,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Also the impacts of antenna correlations on the performance of ST-BC are investigated.

In a conventional MC-CDMA configuration (e.g., in IS-95B) a user can transmit information in multiples (M times) of a basic data rate by using M orthogonal supplemental DS-CDMA channels. In this paper, motivated by the remarkable performance of turbo codes with large interleaving lengths in AWGN channels, we investigate the performance of a MC-CDMA system employing different concatenated encoding schemes combined with iterative decoding. Furthermore, we examine the frame error rate performance of the various schemes by considering CRC codewords in each of the M frames corresponding to each data block. We show that coding and interleaving at the block level improves the block error rate (BlER) performance, especially when turbo schemes are used, while the extra CRC overhead is beneficial mainly when convolutional codes are used.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.800250","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

The HCS under study consists of a macrocell layer which uses wide-band code division multiple access with frequency division duplex (WB-CDMA-FDD). This macrocell layer overlays a microcell layer which uses wide-band time division/code division multiple access with asymmetric time division duplex (WB-TD/CDMA-TDD). System capacity in Erl/carrier/cluster and spectrum efficiency in Kbit/s/MHz/cluster are assessed for three different circuit-switched services and two combinations of them. The impact of different channel allocation strategies (CAS) on the system capacity is also assessed. For this purpose, two different resource allocation strategies are considered in the microcell layer using the WB-TD/CDMA-TDD multiple access scheme (MAS); they are the classic fixed channel assignment (FCA) and a simple dynamic channel allocation (SDCA). For the macrocell layer, using WB-CDMA, only FCA is used, The capacity of this system is also compared with the capacity of a HCS using WB-TD/CDMA-TDD in both layers.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

This paper proposes a new hybrid type II ARQ scheme which uses the same code rate in successive retransmissions. This simplifies the transmitter and receiver designs to a large extent as compared to other hybrid schemes proposed earlier. The retransmission scheme suggested is very similar to that of the widely accepted TIA/EIA/IS-707 RLP. This NAK (negative ACK)-based retransmission mechanism and the simplified transmitter/receiver architectures help to minimize the delays at the transport and link layers. The proposed scheme performs well with a cdma2000 similar physical layer and hence is suitable for 3G environments as well. The results presented in this paper are based on detailed simulation of the proposed scheme using Network Simulator.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.800256","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

One attractive possibility, already used in most of the second-generation networks, is to increase the sectorisation at the base stations, i.e., using 3 or even up to 6 sectors per site. In this paper we demonstrate with simulations and some theoretical derivation how the sectorisation of the base stations influences the performance (capacity and quality of service) of a WCDMA radio network. In addition the simulator and the modelling of the third generation's fast power control and soft handover are presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

This paper studies the performance of UTRA/TDD and how close to the ideal TDD system UTRA/TDD could be. Since both uplink and downlink share the same frequency in TDD, those two transmission directions can interfere with each other. This interference can occur between two mobile stations or between two base stations within one carrier or between two operators. This interference scenario is evaluated here. The results show that for UTRA/TDD operation dynamic channel allocation, synchronization of base stations and cooperation between the operators is preferred to obtain the maximum performance. The most difficult interference situations occur between base stations within one operator's band and between two operators if they are not synchronized.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.800260","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

Our proposed scheme allows the mobile station to use different power increments for different scenarios. Via simulations, we compare two random access channel transmission schemes, namely, the power ramping scheme with and without the multi-threshold detection algorithm. Our simulation results indicate that the access channel throughput increases when the multi-threshold detection algorithm is used together with the power ramping method. The interference caused by the random access channel is largely reduced. In addition, the multi-threshold algorithm allows the base station to send a faster acknowledgement back to the mobile. The access delay is greatly reduced. In conclusion, our proposed enhanced power ramping scheme via multi-threshold detection algorithm greatly improves the performance of the UMTS random access channel.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.800263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECF.1999.800263","startPage":"2631","endPage":"2635 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

Therefore the resolvable paths at the receiver matched filter can not be obtained, and the effective path diversity can not be achieved. This paper proposes a pre-selected artificial path diversity method with multiple sector antennas consisting of delayed PN codes, which is an effective power scheme in such an indoor environment. In the proposed system, only pre-selected sector antennas transmit the signal to reduce signal redundancy, therefore the transmission power is used efficiently at the base station. As a result, better BER performance and the reduction of interference signals between the different channels by means of sector selection can be achieved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PSAP (pre-selected artificial path) diversity system for indoor DS/CDMA","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

We adopt discrete probability mass functions in the suggested method for estimating the statistical characteristics of the received signal from the measured Nth-order central moments to solve the existing difficulties of the importance sampling (IS) techniques. With the discrete probability mass function obtained from fewer received signal samples than those required in IS, the continuous cumulative probability function and its inverse function can be exactly estimated using interpolation and extrapolation techniques. With the simplified channel model, the overall channel performance evaluation can be done within a drastically reduced time. Simulation results applied to a nonlinear digital satellite channel show efficiency in the sense of computer run-time, and demonstrate that the existing problems of IS for nonlinear satellite channels with Mth-order memory can be completely solved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient performance evaluation technique for digital satellite communication channels","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

Coming with higher data rate, the application of WCDMA brings with it new challenges in terms of multiple access interference (MAI) and intersymbol interference (ISI) suppression due to the fact that compared to the 'regular' CDMA, the delay spread is no longer only a few chips. Most of the literature on multiuser detection so far has focused on algorithms which, due to high computational/hardware complexity, are unsuitable for large delay spread channels. In this paper, we present an adaptive symbol-based signal separator based on multishot matched filtering which is suitable for the asynchronous large delay spread fading channel characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.800294","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

For radio on fiber configuration, base stations (BS) receive RF signals from mobiles and transmit them to the radio network controller (RNC) on an optical fiber channel. Since a WCDMA BS is exposed to the whole cellular spectrum, it receives a comb of frequencies of other cellular systems operating in the same geographical area. This provokes intersystem IMD. Apart from this, the CDMA BS is also subjected to the intrasystem IMD instituted by its own CDMA mobile users due to the nonlinearity of the power amplifier (PA). Moreover as the system is optical fiber feeder, the laser diode's (LD) nonlinearity also incites the IMD due to a clipping effect. The nonlinearities instituted by PA and LD can be regarded as intrasystem IMD. In this paper all these IMD are addressed through a unified operation of FEC codes and post-nonlinearity recovery block (PNRB).","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.800297","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

The analysis is applied to evaluate the BEP in a cellular CDMA system. Diversity and multiuser receivers are compared based on the examples. It is observed that the macroscopic diversity improves the performance of receivers significantly in cellular CDMA networks. When comparing diversity and multiuser receivers it is concluded that multiuser receivers are necessary to provide low bit error probabilities. The results also show that the reduction of intercell MAI yields a significant performance advantage in cellular networks.

For the CDMA system a new parallel interference cancellation (PIC) receiver with an adaptive decision threshold is proposed which is complete with the method to adjust the decision threshold. The decision threshold for partial cancellation is adjusted according to the statistics of its matched filter (MF) outputs. The BER of the proposed PIC receiver is obtained by simulation and compared with those of the conventional PIC and other PIC receivers in a Rayleigh fading channel.

Also, the mobile station has access probability to prevent collision increase due to the transmission of short messages. For effective transmission, the mobile station changes the transmission rate based on the transmission queue status to adapt the burst traffic characteristics. In restricted environments of transmission code and bandwidth, the proposed protocol shows better performance than the cdma2000 system.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.800309","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

For bursty sources where transmission needs are restricted to short message lengths, a protocol such as S-ALOHA can be efficient.

This improvement can be provided by a protocol such as ISMA when combined with the DS-CDMA technique.

Generally, adaptive modulation requires precise channel estimation and channel state information feedback. In a wireless channel, a large portion of the total transmitting information is occupied by the feedback information due to the frequent adaptation to time-varying channel attenuation. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multicarrier system which adopts reduced feedback information for wireless application. This scheme is based on the general bit loading pouring algorithm, and suggests that the channel state information can be unified to the fractional number of loaded bits and it can be fed back differentially. In addition, we apply a linear predictor to reduce the degradation during the feedback interval.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village. VTC 1999-Fall.

This type of error control is used to detect errors, asking for a retransmission when errors are detected. It is seen that single ARQ schemes are not suitable for mobile environments, making it necessary to consider other techniques for equalization in order to cope with ISI (intersymbol interference). Using an equalizer does not improve significantly the performance, so hybrid-ARQ (H-ARQ) schemes must be evaluated. The performance is obtained in terms of throughput versus signal-to-noise ratio.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.800321","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village. VTC 1999-Fall.

We propose a W-CDMA modulation scheme of variable transmission rate, partial-balance power control algorithm, and wireless access method for variable access rate. The proposed algorithm integrates traffic priority ranking and transmit power control and access information rate control. Our simulation results show that the partial-balance power control algorithm can render the special QoS requirements of traffic with higher priority orders guaranteed and maximize the CIR of the traffic with lower priority orders. Access rate adaption provides higher channel usage and more successful access probability than the fixed access rate algorithm. Based on the above techniques, we also develop a experimental system which consists of base station and multimedia terminals.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.800326","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

It has been shown that these space-time multiple-antenna systems provide very high capacity when compared to single antenna systems in a Rayleigh fading environment. Specifically for the forward link, space-time coded transmit diversity should be incorporated into the wireless communication system in order to take full advantage of the combined space- (multiple-transmit antennas) and time- (forward error correction coding) diversity scheme. In this paper, we adopt an heuristic approach to the design and evaluation of diagonally layered STCM schemes by utilising classical multiple-trellis coded-modulation (MTCM) techniques. We focus mainly on the construction of simple 4-state diagonally layered space-time convolutionally coded systems. The designed STCM systems will be used in a comparative performance investigation with the originally proposed STCM codes. Computer simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the code designs on flat Rayleigh fading channels.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETECF.1999.800331","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

An equivalent synchronous single bit rate DS/CDMA system is first formulated to break up the detection problem into the blocks of finite length called processing windows. A low delay multipath-combining decision-feedback multiuser detector (LDMCDF) is then proposed based on the equivalent system model. Since the LDMCDF makes the decisions for data bits every processing window, the decision delay is less than the interval of one processing window. The effect of the processing window length on the performance of the LDMCDF is evaluated, and the simulation results show that the LDMCDF provides good performance with negligible decision delay.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.800338","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

This scheme increases the channel utilization, the system capacity and the flexibility of the resource management.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.800340","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

From these calculated results, it is found that at low frequency the magnetic loss is the major contributor to the total losses, but when frequency reaches the MHz range the dielectric loss becomes significant and can't be neglected. The calculated results are also compared with measured results and good agreement between the two values is achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17367/00800554.pdf","startPage":"3451","endPage":"3453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.800554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.800554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17367","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=800554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of iron losses in ferrite toroids using FEM and complex vectors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iron","Ferrites","Dielectric losses","Magnetic losses","Electromagnetic fields","Magnetic separation","Toroidal magnetic fields","Frequency","Electromagnetic analysis","Magnetic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ferrites","magnetic leakage","magnetic cores","finite element analysis","dielectric losses","eddy current losses","electromagnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iron losses","ferrite toroids","FEM","complex vectors","electromagnetic field distribution","ferrimagnetic core","rectangular cross section","magnetic loss","dielectric loss","eddy current loss"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/800554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of iron losses in ferrite toroids using FEM and complex vectors","volume":"35","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6418735","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of iron losses in ferrite toroids using FEM and complex vectors","sourcePdf":"00800554.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030695S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"17367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"9","articleId":"800554","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":800578,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The experimental bandwidth was not limited by the micro-actuator's resonance mode, but the saturation of the micro-actuator driver.","doi":"10.1109/20.800626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.800626","endPage":"3672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17367/00800626.pdf","startPage":"3670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-bandwidth HDD tracking servo by a moving-slider micro-actuator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/800626/","displayDocTitle":"High-bandwidth HDD tracking servo by a moving-slider micro-actuator","volume":"35","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6418780","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-bandwidth HDD tracking servo by a moving-slider micro-actuator","sourcePdf":"00800626.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053006S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"17367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"21","articleId":"800626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":800633,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Chae Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineenng, Changwon NatE28099l University, Changwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Ki-Chae Lim","id":"38240516200"},{"name":"Jung-Pyo Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineenng, Changwon NatE28099l University, Changwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jung-Pyo Hong","id":"37289921800"},{"name":"Gyu-Tak Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineenng, Changwon NatE28099l University, Changwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gyu-Tak Kim","id":"38189405800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"800633","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=800633","abstract":"This paper presents a novel analytical technique of a permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) based on the Equivalent Magnetizing Current (EMC) method.

This paper gives an insight into the influences of the motor design on the levitation force and torque generation. It is shown that especially for machines with small air gaps it can be very important to choose the right design parameters. Increasing the permanent magnet height in order to increase the motor torque can result in a remarkable reduction of radial forces. The interrelationships are discussed on the basis of Maxwell and Lorentz forces acting upon the stator surface. The investigations are presented for a bearingless low cost motor, suited for pump, fan or blower applications. The presented motor needs only four coils for operation.","doi":"10.1109/20.800752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17367/00800752.pdf","startPage":"4052","endPage":"4054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.800752","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=800752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Levitation forces in bearingless permanent magnet motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/800752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Levitation forces in bearingless permanent magnet motors","volume":"35","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6418906","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Levitation forces in bearingless permanent magnet motors","sourcePdf":"00800752.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07199S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"17367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"40","articleId":"800752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":800790,"authors":[{"name":"G.

At very high areal densities each bit of information will thus be recorded on relatively few magnetic grains. Since the grains have random positions and sizes, there will be large statistical fluctuations or noise on the recovered signal. Modelling the media grains as random Voronoi regions, we simulate the process of writing, reading, detection and error-correction. Although the signal-to-noise ratio is very poor, we find that it possible in the simulation to recover data reliably with as few as four grains per bit.","doi":"10.1109/20.800790","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17387/00800790.pdf","startPage":"2253","endPage":"2255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.800790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simulation of magnetic recording on coarsely granular media","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=800790","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/800790/","displayDocTitle":"A simulation of magnetic recording on coarsely granular media","volume":"35","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","accessionNumber":"6399299","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simulation of magnetic recording on coarsely granular media","sourcePdf":"00800790.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027635S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"17387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"14","articleId":"800790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":800791,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

Application of this complement state grouping technique to various partial response channels is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/20.800816","startPage":"2331","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17387/00800816.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.800816","endPage":"2333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reduced-state sequence estimation technique and its applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/800816/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","displayDocTitle":"A reduced-state sequence estimation technique and its applications","volume":"35","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6399325","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reduced-state sequence estimation technique and its applications","sourcePdf":"00800816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030799S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"17387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"4","articleId":"800816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":800973,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The paper describes a novel method of sensorless position detection requiring no special converter or sensor circuitry, and which does not rely on accurate prior knowledge of the magnetic characteristics of the motor. The approach described is novel in two respects. Firstly, it does not rely on accurate prior knowledge of phase winding inductance but merely makes the assumption that it varies substantially as sin(N/sub r//spl theta/), where N/sub r/ is the number of rotor poles and /spl theta/ is rotor angle. Secondly, the approach learns from previous good estimates of position and, once it has done so, makes use of this knowledge where performance of the basic estimation algorithm degrades (principally at low speeds of rotation). The technique has been investigated in simulation and a hardware implementation is under development.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1999.801059","pdfPath":"/iel5/6503/17356/00801059.pdf","startPage":"1073","endPage":"1077 vol. 2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (Cat.

This paper reviews some of the existing stability definitions (string stability), and discusses how the available platoon information and separation policies influences the stability results. It turns out that some of these notions and control policies do not suffice to ensure safety (collision avoidance) of the platoon. This is illustrated via simulation examples showing that there exists, in general, a non-empty set of initial condition that results in a colliding situation. This set is not necessarily small. In connection with this, we propose a new way to formulate the platooning problem aiming at solving some of these difficulties.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.1999.801173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17356","startPage":"1377","endPage":"1382 vol. 2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (Cat.

The network is a self-organized classifier with the ability to adaptively learn new information without forgetting old knowledge. To prove the concept, the simulations have been performed with vibration data. Furthermore, the classification performance of the network has been tested on other benchmark data sets, such as the iris data and a vowel data set. For the generalization capability, comparison studies among other well-known classifiers were performed and the ILFN was found competitive with or even superior to many existing classifiers. Additionally, the ILFN uses far less training time than conventional classifiers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/801205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"22-27 Aug. 1999","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6468573","displayDocTitle":"An effective neuro-fuzzy paradigm for machinery condition health monitoring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective neuro-fuzzy paradigm for machinery condition health monitoring","confLoc":"Kohala Coast, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00801205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028858S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6503","citationCount":"3","articleId":"801205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":801225,"authors":[{"name":"Kuang-Yow Lian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan",""],"lastName":"Kuang-Yow Lian","id":"37295855800"},{"name":"Chian-Song Chin","lastName":"Chian-Song Chin","id":"37086966183"},{"name":"Tung-Sheng Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Tung-Sheng Chiang","id":"37271332600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5446-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"801225","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel robots","Sliding mode control","Fuzzy control","Force control","Kinematics","Control systems","Sampling methods","Fuzzy logic","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","path planning","fuzzy control","variable structure systems","intelligent control","robot dynamics","robot kinematics","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel parking","car-like robot","fuzzy gain scheduling","fuzzy sliding mode controller","path tracking","knowledge-based structure","control gains"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel parking a car-like robot using fuzzy gain scheduling","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1999.801225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17356","endPage":"1691 vol. 2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (Cat.

During the last years, modern cars include more and more electronic systems. These systems are often governed by a computer or a network of computers programmed with powerful software. One of those new services is adaptive cruise control (ACC) (or autonomous intelligent cruise control, AICC), which extends the conventional cruise control system to include automated car following when the preceding car is driving at a lower speed than the desired set-speed. The focus of ACC has mainly been directed towards high-speed highway application, but to improve the comfort to the driver also low-speed situations must be considered. The paper presents an ACC system that is capable of car following in low-speed situations, e.g. in suburban areas, as well as in high-speed situations. The system is implemented in a test car and the result is evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1999.801226","startPage":"1692","endPage":"1697 vol. 2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (Cat.

As such, the MBRNN has the ability to incorporate the analytical knowledge of the plant in its formulation. With its original topology intact, the MBRNN can then be trained to represent the plant nonlinearities through modifying its node activation functions, which consist of contours of Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs). Training involves adjusting the weights of the RBFs so as to modify the contours representing the activation functions. The performance of the MBRNN is demonstrated via several examples. The results indicate that it requires much shorter training than needed by ordinary recurrent networks.

In particular we investigate the efficiency of extended high capacitance layers used as decoupling capacitors. The proposed method works with a lumped element FDTD technique which facilitates electromagnetic simulation of the substrate simultaneous with simulation of the mounted electronic circuit. The stratified configuration of multilayer structures allows division of the 3D problem into separate 2D problems. This yields an efficient algorithm. The algorithm has been implemented in C++ and tested with different examples. Furthermore we present reference data derived by analytical investigation of a circular plate capacitor.

FDTD is well-suited to modeling large-scale geometries such as cables that might be driven against PCB ground planes as a result of a noise voltage that appears at the connector. Three specific cases are addressed herein including a simple cable driven against a PCB ground, coupling between a high-speed digital and I/O line that drives a cable against the PCB, and the finite impedance of the PCB reference plane that results in an effective noise source that drives the PCB ground against the cable. The FDTD modeling is compared with measurements.

At the Ka band the bit errors are affected by atmospheric fluctuations, but not by ionospheric fluctuations.

Dual polarized antennas with nearly identical radiation patterns for both polarization ports are used. The investigations of the polarization matrix are conducted in terms of cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) and correlation coefficients. The effect of different XPD's for the horizontal and the vertical polarization is mainly caused by the suppression of the horizontal co-polarized components in the propagation environment.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.801485","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

Due to the complicated nature of the spatial average, though, previous capacity studies have resorted to numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo simulation. In this paper, we develop a fully analytical and computationally straightforward technique for the computation of outage probability through a simple, yet accurate, geometric approximation in the spatial average. An attractive feature of the technique is that it does not rely upon a hexagonal cell layout, thus enabling the study of more generalized systems in which the co-channel cells are of arbitrary size and location.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

The scattering model is arranged so that the main parameters, having a precise physical meaning, can be easily tuned using classical measurement or simulation results reported in the literature. A basic urban topology has been considered and the impact of diffuse scattering on narrowband as well as wideband propagation parameters has been investigated. Although the scattering parameters have been underestimated (with respect to literature data) in order for the evaluation to be more conservative, the scattering contribution has shown to be very important for both received power and channel dispersion in a variety of cases.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

When there is traffic deviation, the communications quality differs between cells. Some methods of equalizing the quality, such as signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)-based power control methods and flexible cell control methods have been developed. The method described in this paper controls the transmission power ratio allocated to the mobile stations in a soft handoff region according to the traffic load. The SIR difference between cells can be reduced by controlling the power transmitted to the soft handoff mobile stations. We calculate an optimum power allocation ratio for minimizing the SIR difference for a given traffic deviation range and the downlink orthogonality factor.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum soft handoff considering non-uniform traffic in CDMA cellular systems","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

We introduce some important properties of fractal arrays, including the frequency-independent multi-band characteristics, schemes for realizing low-sidelobe designs, systematic approaches to thinning, and the ability to develop rapid beam-forming algorithms by exploiting the recursive nature of fractals. These arrays have fractional dimensions that are found from the generating subarray used to recursively create the fractal array.

This paper presents an overview of the design and measured performance of some examples of dielectric lenses that can be used in typical scenarios of wireless broadband communication systems.

A single cell scenario is adopted where there is perfect channel side information. The forward link of the BPSK/CDMA is considered where the fading amplitudes of all the received signals are equal. The turbo decoder is modified to take into account the exact expression for the multiuser interference term. It is shown that the inputs of the turbo decoder which are affected by multiuser interference are statistically independent, and thus the log-likelihood ratio at the output of the decoder can be separated into three terms as in the case of AWGN channels. The performance of the modified turbo encoding/decoding scheme is investigated by simulations in the low signal-to-noise ratio region for different values of processing gain and different number of users.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

In this paper we consider their application in the context of turbo codes. We describe simplified techniques for modifying a decoder for turbo codes to incorporate the hidden Markov model. This will allow the receiver to utilize the statistical characteristics of the source or channel during the decoding process, leading to significantly improved performance relative to systems in which the Markov properties are not exploited. For the case of binary hidden Markov sources and continuous hidden Markov channels, the lack of a priori knowledge of the parameters of the model does not degrade the performance of turbo decoding since these parameters can be jointly estimated with turbo decoding.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.801561","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

The nonbinary symbol alphabet requires an excessively high number of states in a trellis based equalizer. Therefore, sub-optimum equalizers have to be considered. In this paper we investigated a block decision feedback equalizer derived from the minimum mean square error criterion. In order to enhance its performance we incorporate a priori information from the channel decoder. Turbo equalization iteratively detects and decodes coded data transmitted over a frequency selective channel. By feeding back a priori information from the channel decoder this technique enables the equalizer to make less erroneous decisions and provides more reliable soft values to the channel decoder. The simulation environment is based on the GSM system where the payload is modulated by 8-PSK. Simulation results show that the BER at the decoder output can be improved by about 2 to 3 dB using a couple of iterations in a typical urban channel environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/801568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6520840","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Turbo equalization for an 8-PSK modulation scheme in a mobile TDMA communication system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo equalization for an 8-PSK modulation scheme in a mobile TDMA communication system","confLoc":"Amsterdam, The Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00801568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030051S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6454","citationCount":"25","articleId":"801568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":801570,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

When the communication system comprises an inner convolutional encoder with a bit-interleaver, it is shown that an iterative receiver obtained from the concatenation of a MAP M-DPSK detector and a MAP convolutional decoder is capable of improving the performance in both channel environments. Such a receiver is based on the turbo decoding concept of refining the reliability information provided at the output of each soft-in/soft-out receiver stage, by running multiple detection/decoding iterations in a receiver with feedback from the outer stage to the inner stage. Furthermore, the general case of multiple receiving antennas is considered. Combining the received signals is addressed in both an environment characterized by thermal noise (i.e. AWGN) uncorrelated through the antenna elements, and an environment characterized by spatially correlated noise such that arising in the presence of cochannel interference in a TDMA system (e.g. IS-136).","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.801570","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

The hysteresis and the ramp comparator controllers are getting more attention due to their simplicity and high dynamic responses. In this work, fixed, sinusoidal and mixed band hysteresis current controllers, as well as conventional ramp and improved ramp comparator controllers are considered. The harmonic spectra of the motor line currents for various current controllers are obtained using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) for comparison purposes. The comparison is based on experimental results.

Operation principle of the ARCPI NPC inverter is illustrated. A simple method dealing with the static overvoltage problem of the inner switches is described. Commutation durations and current stresses in the basic ARCPI circuit are analyzed. The results enable mathematical understanding and practical designing of the basic ARCPI circuit. In particular, self balancing quality and controlling possibility of the DC center potential in the basic ARCPI circuit are investigated.

A soft-output PIC algorithm is followed by a log-MAP receiver for decoding of convolutional codes. An integrated receiver that implements multiple stages of interference cancellation and decoding is presented and evaluated through simulation. This integrated approach is compared with a partitioned approach, where the final stage output of PIC is followed by decoding using a soft-input Viterbi algorithm (VA). Results presented for BER and capacity of the two systems show that both techniques represent a substantial improvement over conventional detection, but the more complex integrated approach provides only a small improvement over the decoupled approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

In order to meet the increasing demand in capacity and achieve multirate services in the 3G wireless communication systems, wideband code division mltiple access (CDMA) has emerged as the main candidate under consideration. However, because of its inherent multiple access interference, the performance of CDMA can be severely degraded as the number of subscribers increases. Multiuser detection is a scheme which jointly detects all users' signals and by doing so can offer significant system performance improvement. This paper investigates and analyzes the performance of multiuser successive interference cancellation in a coded wideband DS/CDMA communication system. Specifically, a new multistage interference cancellation method is presented which employs a combined coding, successive interference cancellation and random interleaving. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly increase the system capacity and performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

However the performance gap between the conventional MMSE receiver and the theoretical bound is still large. We therefore propose an extended MMSE receiver which spans three symbol intervals the desired symbol interval as well as the previous and the next symbol interval. The extended MMSE receiver outperforms the conventional MMSE receiver especially for large system load and large number of propagation paths in the channel. Its computational complexity is approximately three times the complexity of the conventional MMSE receiver but still independent of the number of active users and the number of paths in the channel. As a consequence the extended MMSE receiver allows a low-complexity low-power implementation in the mobile user-terminal for communication over multipath slow fading channels in the forward link.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.801715","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

Our results show that the power optimization significantly increases the system capacity. We present a global optimization strategy that allocates power at the various macrodiversity antennas so that the average of all users' BERs is minimized. In practice, the complexity of this global optimization problem is reduced as many of the links are extremely weak and can be removed from the optimization. Our simulation results demonstrate that when compared to traditional soft handoff power allocation, our optimization algorithm increases the capacity for a given quality of service. The simulation results indicate downlink capacity gains on the order of 10-20%.","displayPublicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village. VTC 1999-Fall.

This assumption typically holds in frequency-division duplex (FDD) based mobile communication systems. We consider the SDMA strategy for using antenna arrays to gain system capacity. The channel is assumed to comprise specular multipath, and a per-path argument is pursued to design FIR transmission filters at the base station in order to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the mobile receivers. Joint optimization of the transmitter and receiver is considered. The per path decorrelating pre-filter is introduced, and it is shown that due to the large number of degrees of freedom available because of the large processing gain (inherent oversampling with respect to the symbol rate in CDMA) and possible multiple antennas/oversampling, the downlink performance can be greatly improved in the FDD problem.","doi":"10.1109/VETECF.1999.801729","publicationTitle":"Gateway to 21st Century Communications Village.

This is only true provided that an alternative balancing PWM control strategy is adopted instead of the standard PWM one. A control strategy is proposed which is based on the development of an energy function which may be minimized in real time by exploiting the existing redundancies in power-converter switching states. This strategy may be easily implemented in a DSP controller and is usable with any number of voltage levels and input/output phases.

We first consider the B-spline bases in the terms of convolution in signal processing. The presented analysis requires careful usage of continuous and discrete representation of B-spline. Emphasis is given to the important difference between B-spline interpolation and approximation. The difference is shown through frequency domain analysis, so we derive frequency responses of the B-spline interpolation and approximation. We conclude by demonstrating the use of several reconstruction filters and appropriate gradient estimators in volume rendering. Exact reconstruction in volume visualization is very important in many industrial applications, such as material cavity control.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency domain analysis of B-spline interpolation","publicationTitle":"ISIE '99.

By allowing a user to select an arbitrary cell and lift it up with direct manipulation, the system utilizes the third dimension to ameliorate visual occlusion of crossing arcs. As the user lifts a focused cell up, the interrelated cells are lifted up together; thus hidden dataflow networks can be visually intelligible interactively. Because spreadsheets are aimed at calculation itself rather than appearances of outputs, their mechanism is relatively invisible and not obvious for ordinary users. Our visualization helps such users to understand structures and mechanism of spreadsheets.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17394","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis'99)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization (InfoVis'99)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6510/17394/00801861.pdf","doi":"10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFVIS.1999.801861","startPage":"79","endPage":"82","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D interactive visualization for inter-cell dependencies of spreadsheets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/801861/","displayDocTitle":"3D interactive visualization for inter-cell dependencies of spreadsheets","conferenceDate":"24-29 Oct. 1999","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6423207","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D interactive visualization for inter-cell dependencies of spreadsheets","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00801861.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03413S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6510","citationCount":"9","articleId":"801861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":801869,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The technique is based upon a modified genetic algorithm, which is applied at an upper level stage, and a successive linear program at a lower level stage. The objective is the minimization of the total cost associated to the installation of the new sources. The genetic algorithm is devoted to defining the location of the new reactive power sources, and therefore to handle the combinatorial nature of the fixed costs problem. At the lower level, the variable cost problem is solved by calculating the magnitude of the sources to be installed at the previously determined locations by means of a linear program iterated successively with a fast decoupled load flow.

To help answer such questions, this paper proposes a method for determining how much of the active and reactive power output of each generator is contributed by each load. This method takes as its starting point a solved power flow solution. All power injections are translated into real and imaginary currents to avoid the problems arising from the nonlinear coupling between active and reactive power flows caused by losses. The method then traces these currents to determine how much current each source supplies to each sink. These current contributions can then be translated into contributions to the active and reactive power output of the generators. It is also shown that the global contribution of a load can be decomposed into contributions from its active and reactive parts. This decomposition is reasonably accurate for the reactive power generation. To determine the contributions to active power generation, the previously-described method based on the active power flows is recommended.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Power generation","Load flow","Power system economics","Power generation economics","Power system analysis computing","Power systems","Power engineering computing","Current supplies","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","reactive power","electric generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reactive power","active power","generators","loads","imaginary currents","real currents","competitive environment","usage allocation","reactive power output","active power output","power flow solution","power injections","nonlinear coupling","losses","active power flows","power system economics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/59.801890","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/17392/00801890.pdf","startPage":"1312","endPage":"1319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.801890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracing active and reactive power between generators and loads using real and imaginary currents","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=801890","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tracing active and reactive power between generators and loads using real and imaginary currents","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/801890/","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6413318","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracing active and reactive power between generators and loads using real and imaginary currents","sourcePdf":"00801890.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039899S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"149","articleId":"801890","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":801891,"authors":[{"name":"V.M. da Costa","affiliation":["COPPE-EE-UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"firstName":"V.M.","lastName":"da Costa","id":"37435113400"},{"name":"N.

The results presented show that the proposed method leads to a substantially faster power flow solution, when compared to the conventional Newton Raphson formulation, expressed in terms of power mismatches and written in polar coordinates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/801891/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6419510","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Developments in the Newton Raphson power flow formulation based on current injections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developments in the Newton Raphson power flow formulation based on current injections","sourcePdf":"00801891.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036776S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"141","articleId":"801891","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":801894,"authors":[{"name":"B.F.

The economic cost of inaccurate forecasts is assessed by a combination of forecast simulation, unit commitment optimization, and economic dispatch modeling for several different generation/load systems. The forecast simulation preserves the error distributions and correlations actually experienced by users of a neural net-based forecasting system. Underforecasts result in purchases of expensive peaking or spot market power; overforecasts inflate start-up and fixed costs because too much capacity is committed. The value of improved accuracy is found to depend on load and generator characteristics; for the systems considered here, a reduction of 1% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) decreases variable generation costs by approximately 0.1%-0.3% when MAPE is in the range of 3%-5%. These values are broadly consistent with the results of a survey of 19 utilities, using estimates obtained by simpler methods. A conservative estimate is that a 1% reduction in forecasting error for a 10,000 MW utility can save up to $1.6 million annually.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/17392/00801894.pdf","startPage":"1342","endPage":"1348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.801894","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.801894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17392","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=801894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the value for unit commitment of improved load forecasts","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load forecasting","Economic forecasting","Power system economics","Power generation economics","Costs","Fuel economy","Predictive models","Power system analysis computing","Error correction","Environmental economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system economics","power generation dispatch","load forecasting","power generation scheduling","optimisation","electricity supply industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasts improvement","unit commitment","suboptimal unit commitment decisions","economic cost","mean absolute percentage error","unit commitment optimization","economic dispatch modeling","generation/load systems","forecast simulation","10000 MW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/801894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the value for unit commitment of improved load forecasts","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6413321","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the value for unit commitment of improved load forecasts","sourcePdf":"00801894.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0437S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"121","articleId":"801894","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":801906,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The first layer uses a genetic algorithm (GA) to decide the on/off status of the units. The second layer uses a nonlinear programming formulation solved by a Lagrangian relaxation to perform the economic dispatch while meeting all plant and system constraints. In order to deal effectively with the constraints of the problem and prune the search space of the GA in advance, the difficult minimum up/down-time constraints of thermal generation units and the turbine/pump operating constraint of storage power stations are embedded in the binary strings that are coded to represent the on/off-states of the generating units. The other constraints are handled by integrating penalty costs into the fitness function. In order to save execution time, the economic dispatch is only performed if the given unit commitment schedule is able to meet the load balance, energy, and begin/end level constraints. The proposed solution approach was tested on a real scaled hydro-thermal power system over a period of a day in half-hour time-steps for different GA-parameters. The simulation results reveal that the features of easy implementation, convergence within an acceptable execution time, and a highly optimal solution in solving the unit commitment problem can be achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/801929/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6413337","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm for solving the unit commitment problem of a hydro-thermal power system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm for solving the unit commitment problem of a hydro-thermal power system","sourcePdf":"00801929.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045798S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"76","articleId":"801929","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":801936,"authors":[{"name":"H.B.

This paper suggests that this goal can he achieved by tightly integrating a probabilistic reserve assessment with the unit commitment (UC) function. This enables the reliability of individual units and the uncertainty of the load forecast to be considered for short-term scheduling. The generation can then be scheduled to meet a given risk index. It is further argued that the optimal value of this risk index should be selected on the basis of a tradeoff between the total schedule cost obtained from the UC solution and the expected cost of energy not served which can be derived from the probabilistic reserve assessment. Finally, the problem of over-commitment of reserve in Lagrangian relaxation based UC is reduced by means of a new unit decommitment technique incorporating a look-ahead feature.","doi":"10.1109/59.801936","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/17392/00801936.pdf","startPage":"1485","endPage":"1492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.801936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal scheduling of spinning reserve","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=801936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/801936/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal scheduling of spinning reserve","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6413339","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal scheduling of spinning reserve","sourcePdf":"00801936.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054347S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"202","articleId":"801936","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":801943,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Competition forces utilities to improve power quality as well as to reduce investment and operation costs. Feeder imbalance describes a situation in which the voltages of a three-phase voltage source are not identical in magnitude, or the phase differences between them are not 120 electrical degrees, or both. It affects motors and other devices that depend upon a well-balanced three-phase voltage source. Phase balancing is to make the voltages balanced at each load point of the feeder. Phase swapping is a direct approach for phase balancing with the minimum cost. Phase balancing can enhance utilities' competitive capability by improving reliability, quality, and reducing costs. Therefore, phase balancing optimization is nowadays receiving more attention in the power industry, especially in today's deregulating environments. The nonlinear effects, such as, voltage drops and energy losses, make the problem difficult to solve. This paper introduces simulated annealing as an effective method to solve a power distribution phase balancing problem with its nonlinear effects.","doi":"10.1109/59.801943","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/17392/00801943.pdf","startPage":"1508","endPage":"1513","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.801943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17392","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase balancing using simulated annealing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=801943","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/801943/","displayDocTitle":"Phase balancing using simulated annealing","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6413340","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase balancing using simulated annealing","sourcePdf":"00801943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041809S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17392","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"79","articleId":"801943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":801957,"authors":[{"name":"M.

More subtle properties of gait rhythm may also be altered. We hypothesized that, independent of gait speed, gait dynamics may provide prognostic and diagnostic utility and offer insight into underlying control mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the gait dynamics of healthy controls and subjects with Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We then studied the relationship among three different aspects of gait: (a) gait speed and rhythm (stride time), (b) the magnitude of the fluctuations in gait rhythm, and (c) three measures of fluctuation dynamics. The results are: (1) Gait speed, average stride time and stride time variability (fluctuation magnitude) were highly correlated (p <0.0001) with each other. However, much of the variance in each measure was not explained by the association with the other (i.e. r/spl Lt/1.0). (2). Similarly, the three measures of fluctuation dynamics were significantly correlated with each other (p<0.0001), but were not entirely redundant. (3) The three measures of fluctuation dynamics were independent of gait speed or stride time.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.1999.802664","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the First Joint BMES/EMBS Conference. 1999 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology 21st Annual Conference and the 1999 Annual Fall Meeting of the Biomedical Engineering Society (Cat.

The algorithm is an extension of the 2-D adaptive fuzzy C-means algorithm (2-D AFCM) presented in previous work by the authors. This algorithm models the intensity inhomogeneities as a gain field that causes image intensities to smoothly and slowly vary through the image space. It iteratively adapts to the intensity inhomogeneities and is completely automated. In this paper, the authors fully generalize 2-D AFCM to three-dimensional (3-D) multispectral images. Because of the potential size of 3-D image data, they also describe a new faster multigrid-based algorithm for its implementation. They show, using simulated MR data, that 3-D AFCM yields lower error rates than both the standard fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm and two other competing methods, when segmenting corrupted images. Its efficacy is further demonstrated using real 3-D scalar and multispectral MR brain images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/802752/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","volume":"18","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"6433154","pubMedId":"10571379","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive fuzzy segmentation of magnetic resonance images","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive fuzzy segmentation of magnetic resonance images","sourcePdf":"00802752.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041983S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"17406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"581","articleId":"802752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":802755,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The method is based on the Laplacian scale-space representation of the mammogram only. First, possible locations of microcalcifications are identified as local maxima in the filtered image on a range of scales. For each finding, the size and local contrast is estimated, based on the Laplacian response denoted as the scale-space signature. A finding is marked as a microcalcification if the estimated contrast is larger than a predefined threshold which depends on the size of the finding. It is shown that the signature has a characteristic peak, revealing the corresponding image features. This peak can be robustly determined. The basic method is significantly improved by consideration of the statistical variation of the estimated contrast, which is the result of the complex noise characteristic of the mammograms. The method is evaluated with the Nijmegen database and compared to other methods using these mammograms. Results are presented as the free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROG) performance. At a rate of one false positive cluster per image the method reaches a sensitivity of 0.84, which is comparable to the best results achieved so far.","doi":"10.1109/42.802755","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/17406/00802755.pdf","startPage":"774","endPage":"786","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.802755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scale-space signatures for the detection of clustered microcalcifications in digital mammograms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/802755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Scale-space signatures for the detection of clustered microcalcifications in digital mammograms","volume":"18","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6433157","pubMedId":"10571382","publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scale-space signatures for the detection of clustered microcalcifications in digital mammograms","sourcePdf":"00802755.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035787S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"17406","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"101","articleId":"802755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":802756,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohui Hao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaohui Hao","id":"37376281700"},{"name":"Shangkai Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shangkai Gao","id":"37277838600"},{"name":"Xiaorong Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaorong Gao","id":"37277462900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"802756","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":157,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":703},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=802756","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speckle","Biomedical imaging","Adaptive filters","Wavelet domain","Wavelet coefficients","Back","In vitro","Heart","Testing","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speckle","biomedical ultrasonics","medical image processing","acoustic signal processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiscale nonlinear thresholding method","ultrasonic speckle suppressing","medical B-scan ultrasonic images","adaptive filter","multiscale wavelet domain","wavelet coefficients","Donoho's soft thresholding method","computer-simulated image","in vitro B-scan image","pig heart","adaptive preprocessing","resolvable details preservation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Artifacts","Computer Simulation","Echocardiography","Image Enhancement","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Swine"]}],"doi":"10.1109/42.802756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/17406/00802756.pdf","startPage":"787","endPage":"794","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.802756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel multiscale nonlinear thresholding method for ultrasonic speckle suppressing","abstract":"This paper presents a novel speckle suppression method for medical B-scan ultrasonic images. An original image is first separated into two parts with an adaptive filter.

The processed coefficients for each part are then transformed back into the space domain. Finally, the denoised image is obtained as the sum of the two processed parts. A computer-simulated image and an in vitro B-scan image of a pig heart have been used to test the performance of this new method.

The use of tunable active-input current mirrors would meet both requirements. In conventional active-input current mirrors, stability compensation is required. Furthermore, once stabilized, the input current cannot be made arbitrarily small. In this paper we introduce two new active-input current mirrors that clamp their input node to a given voltage. One of them does not require compensation, while the other may under some circumstances. However, for both, the input current may take any value. The mirrors can operate with their transistors biased in strong inversion, weak inversion, or even as CMOS compatible lateral bipolar devices. If it is biased in weak inversion or as lateral bipolars, the current mirror gain can be tuned over a very wide range. According to the experimental measurements provided in this paper, the input current may spawn beyond nine decades and the current mirror gain can be tuned over 11 decades. As an application example, a sinusoidal g/sub m/-C-based VCO has been fabricated, whose oscillation frequency could be tuned for over seven decades, between 73 mHz and 1 MHz.","doi":"10.1109/81.802845","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/81/17405/00802845.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.802845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17405","startPage":"1398","endPage":"1407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Very wide range tunable CMOS/bipolar current mirrors with voltage clamped input","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=802845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Very wide range tunable CMOS/bipolar current mirrors with voltage clamped input","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/802845/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6420413","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Very wide range tunable CMOS/bipolar current mirrors with voltage clamped input","sourcePdf":"00802845.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028026S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17405","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"39","articleId":"802845","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":802847,"authors":[{"name":"H.

By applying multichip methods to active pixel sensors, the 39/spl times/30 mm system contains on board all the control circuitry and A/D converters, so the system outputs digital data. The large area requires a redundancy of design for a high yield. This starts with the active pixel cell, which able to withstand several defects and still be repairable, which CCD cells are not. The whole system is targeted at preventing bad rows or columns. By using spares in the row and column circuitry, as well as spare A/D converters the chip yield is only limited by a relatively small logic and control block. With repairs the yield of this 11.7 sq. cm system goes from almost nil to more than 80%-93% with modest defect densities of 1.5 to 0.5 per sq. cm.

Three kinds of heavy ions were used to test devices under different conditions of energy release that generates different amount of charge inside the chip. In particular, 30 MeV/AMU /sup 93/Nb (LET/sub Si//spl sim/21 MeV/(mg/cm/sup 2/), R/sub Si//spl sim/397 /spl mu/m), 30 MeV/AMU /sup 120/Sn (LET/sub Si//spl sim/30 MeV/(mg/cm/sup 2/), R/sub Si//spl sim/370 /spl mu/m) and 15 MeV/AMU /sup 197/Au (LET/sub Si//spl sim/90 MeV/(mg/cm/sup 2/), R/sub Si//spl sim/95 /spl mu/m) were used. In all cases, the bare dies were directly bonded on an AF4 carrier to avoid plastic and lead-frame shielding. Different failure types that could affect the operations of a system based on this device were registered. To verify that the characteristics of the events depend on the zone struck by the particle, a specific test was performed.","doi":"10.1109/DFTVS.1999.802881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFTVS.1999.802881","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems (EFT'99)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems (EFT'99)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6514/17398/00802881.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure tests on 64 Mb SDRAM in radiation environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1999","displayDocTitle":"Failure tests on 64 Mb SDRAM in radiation environment","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6537002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/802881/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure tests on 64 Mb SDRAM in radiation environment","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00802881.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085911S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6514","citationCount":"7","articleId":"802881","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":802882,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Feng Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chi-Feng Wu","id":"37364982000"},{"name":"Chih-Tsun Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Tsun Huang","id":"37281272400"},{"name":"Cheng-Wen Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Wen Wu","id":"37276423200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-0325-x","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"}],"articleNumber":"802882","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":484},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Algorithm design and analysis","Analytical models","Design for testability","Logic testing","Costs","Built-in self-test","Automatic testing","Engines","Semiconductor device testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","computational complexity","random-access storage","integrated memory circuits","integrated circuit testing","fault simulation","automatic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RAMSES","fast memory fault simulator","random access memory simulator","error screening","memory fault models","fault descriptors","time complexity","cocktail-March tests","March-CW test algorithm","word-oriented memories"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a memory fault simulator called the Random Access Memory Simulator for Error Screening (RAMSES). Although it was designed based on some well-known memory fault models, the algorithm that we developed ensures that new fault models can be included easily by adding new fault descriptors instead of modifying the algorithm or program. With RAMSES, the time complexity of memory fault simulation is improved from O(N/sup 3/) to O(N/sup 2/), where N is the memory capacity in terns of bits. Our approach requires only a small amount of extra memory space. Simulation results by RAMSES show that running the proposed cocktail-March tests can significantly reduce the test time. With the help of RAMSES, an efficient test algorithm called March-CW was developed for word-oriented memories.","doi":"10.1109/DFTVS.1999.802882","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems (EFT'99)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems (EFT'99)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6514/17398/00802882.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFTVS.1999.802882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RAMSES: a fast memory fault simulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=802882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/802882/","displayDocTitle":"RAMSES: a fast memory fault simulator","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6537003","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RAMSES: a fast memory fault simulator","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00802882.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058747S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6514","citationCount":"31","articleId":"802882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":802887,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The transformations aim at making the program able to detect most of the soft-errors affecting data and code, independently of the Error Detection Mechanisms (EDMs) possibly implemented by the hardware. Since the transformations can be automatically applied as a pre-compilation phase, the programmer is freed from the cost and responsibility of introducing suitable EDMs in its code. Preliminary experimental results are reported, showing the fault coverage obtained by the method, as well as some figures concerning the slow-down and code size increase it causes.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems (EFT'99)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6514/17398/00802887.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"218","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems (EFT'99)","doi":"10.1109/DFTVS.1999.802887","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFTVS.1999.802887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17398","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=802887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-error detection through software fault-tolerance techniques","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault detection","Fault tolerance","Circuit faults","Programming profession","Costs","Hardware","Computer errors","High level languages","Read only memory","Safety devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error detection","redundancy","software fault tolerance","high level languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-error detection","software fault-tolerance techniques","data redundancy","code redundancy","high-level language","fault coverage"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/802887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Soft-error detection through software fault-tolerance techniques","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6537008","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-error detection through software fault-tolerance techniques","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00802887.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060377S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6514","citationCount":"91","articleId":"802887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":802890,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.

Such codes are well understood and their capabilities for error detection and correction clearly established in the literature. For correction purposes, error location is required; for this reason error-control codes' detection capabilities significantly exceed their correction capabilities. If error location information can be determined and supplied prior to processing by code-checking circuitry, such correction capability can be significantly enhanced in special circumstances. One such circumstance is that of bit \"erasures\". This work focuses on the use of undefined logic levels (near neither V/sub dd/ nor V/sub ss/) as an erasure detection method. It is shown how the error correction capabilities of error-correction codes of various d/sub min/ are enhanced by pre-detection of erasures. An implementation example is presented: this 9-bit parity-based erasure correction circuit is described; test results of the the fabricated circuit are presented as a comparison with capabilities of a simple parity checker. Specific details of extension to higher-order codes are presented.","doi":"10.1109/DFTVS.1999.802896","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems (EFT'99)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems (EFT'99)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6514/17398/00802896.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFTVS.1999.802896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17398","startPage":"293","endPage":"301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Erasure error correction with hardware detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=802896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Erasure error correction with hardware detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/802896/","conferenceDate":"1-3 Nov. 1999","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6537015","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Erasure error correction with hardware detection","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00802896.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025357S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17398","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6514","citationCount":"2","articleId":"802896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":802898,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

By applying a powerful one-shot Reed-Solomon error correction code (ECC) to the data stored in the DRAM, the refresh rate and memory system power usage can be greatly reduced while still maintaining data integrity. An adaptive refresh rate controller was developed in order to ensure robustness against the variations in data retention time due to perturbation effects such as DRAM part-to-part variations, environmental changes and data pattern sensitivity, while at the same time minimizing power usage. By checking for data failures among a small subset of data bits which are dynamically selected at the beginning of each use of the system, the state of the perturbation effects are predicted and used to adjust the refresh rate. As a result, a system was developed that provides reliability equivalent to standard DRAM systems while greatly (10-100X) reducing the refresh power.

Many different fault-tolerance methods have been considered previously for DRAMs but, because of the constraints of conventional commodity memory, only a few methods, such as redundant rows and columns, have entered wide-spread use. Our research on file memory breaks from past work by relaxing the requirements that random-access be fast and that shipped devices contain 100% of the nominal working bit capacity. We show that, under the relaxed requirements of file memory, the greater potential efficiencies of large ECC codewords and bad block marking may become cost-effective.

This method is suited for the makers, since the yield of the chip is considerably improved, specially for large sizes. On the other hand, defect-free chips can be used as either maximum size, ordinary array chips or fault tolerant chips. In the fault tolerant chips, the users will be able to achieve directly the fault tolerance by only shifting the design data automatically, without changing the physical design of the running application, without loading other configurations data from the off-chip FPGA, and without the intervention of the company. For tolerating defective resources, the use of spare CLBs is required.

The results are illustrated via numerical simulation examples.","doi":"10.1109/9.802909","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/17404/00802909.pdf","startPage":"1995","endPage":"2006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.802909","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of a class of neural networks for solving linear programming problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=802909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/802909/","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of a class of neural networks for solving linear programming problems","volume":"44","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6425846","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of a class of neural networks for solving linear programming problems","sourcePdf":"00802909.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044666S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17404","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"90","articleId":"802909","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":802910,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.D.

A significant part of this work has been heuristic in nature, and the conclusions drawn are generally justified using computer simulations. The general success of the simulation studies has also resulted in the increased use of artificial neural networks as controllers in industrial applications. As a result, there is a real need for a better understanding of the questions and problems that can arise in such contexts.

The simplest of these templates is an fcc lattice of close-packed, weakly sintered spheres. Other templates include hcp and hexagonal AB/sub 2/ self-organizing photonic crystals. These photonic crystals may be converted into PEG materials by partially infiltrating the template with high refractive index semiconductors such as Si, Ge, or GaP and subsequently removing the template. The resulting \"inverse opal\" structure exhibits both a photonic pseudogap and a complete (3D) PBG in the near visible spectrum, spanning up to 15% of the gap center frequency. The local density of states (LDOS) for photons exhibits considerable variation from point to point in coordinate space and reveals large spectral gaps even in the absence of a PEG in the total density of states. These gaps in the LDOS may lead to novel effects in quantum and nonlinear optics when active atoms or molecules are placed within the PBG material. These effects include anomalous, low threshold nonlinear response, collective atomic switching, and low-threshold all-optical transistor action. When an optically birefringent nematic liquid crystal is infiltrated into the void regions of the \"inverse\" opal PBG material, the resulting composite material exhibits a completely tunable PBG. In particular, the 3D PBG can be completely opened or closed by applying an electric field which rotates the axis of the nematic molecules relative to the inverse opal backbone.","doi":"10.1109/50.802976","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"1931","endPage":"1943","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17410/00802976.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.802976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photonic bandgap formation and tunability in certain self-organizing systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photonic band gap","Crystalline materials","Photonic crystals","Nonlinear optics","Atom optics","Optical materials","Composite materials","Large-scale systems","Lattices","Semiconductor materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-assembly","photonic band gap","refractive index","nonlinear optics","electro-optical effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organizing systems","photonic bandgap","tunability","microfabrication","FCC lattice","refractive index","inverse opal structure","photonic pseudogap","near visible spectrum","local density of states","low threshold nonlinear response","collective atomic switching","all-optical transistor","optically birefringent nematic liquid crystal","applied electric field"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Photonic bandgap formation and tunability in certain self-organizing systems","volume":"17","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6424878","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/802976/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photonic bandgap formation and tunability in certain self-organizing systems","sourcePdf":"00802976.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053466S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"94","articleId":"802976","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":802985,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this work, we have reached 1.55 /spl mu/m, this certainly represents a decisive issue for this technology. First, the reflection performances of a hexagonal and a triangular lattice of air holes are compared. The triangular lattice reduces technological requirements because the complete photonic bandgap (PBG) results from the overlap of broader forbidden bands of lower order. Second, a combined experimental and theoretical study is presented of the reflection properties of a 2D photonic crystal in a three-dimensional (3D) optical environment. This reveals the critical parameters that can degrade the performances of such 2-D structures. Reflection coefficients up to 98% are obtained with optical quality interfaces. Finally, a complete PBG centered at 1.55 /spl mu/m is demonstrated with a submicrometer period triangular lattice defined by holographic lithography. The influence of the air filling factor on the band position and the interface quality is analyzed by reflection measurements. The overall results show the high flexibility of the macroporous silicon technology and its applicability to integrated optics at telecommunication wavelengths.","doi":"10.1109/50.802985","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"1989","endPage":"1995","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17410/00802985.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.802985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional photonic crystals in macroporous silicon: from mid-infrared (10 /spl mu/m) to telecommunication wavelengths (1.3-1.5 /spl mu/m)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Photonic crystals","Silicon","Optical reflection","Lattices","Holography","Holographic optical components","Crystalline materials","Photonic band gap","Degradation","Lithography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicon","elemental semiconductors","porous semiconductors","photonic band gap","infrared spectra","reflectivity","integrated optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["macroporous silicon","2D photonic crystals","hexagonal air hole lattice","triangular air hole lattice","photonic bandgap","reflection coefficients","holographic lithography","air filling factor","band position","interface quality","integrated optics","telecommunication wavelengths","1.3 to 1.5 mum","10 mum","1.55 mum","Si"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional photonic crystals in macroporous silicon: from mid-infrared (10 /spl mu/m) to telecommunication wavelengths (1.3-1.5 /spl mu/m)","volume":"17","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6424886","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/802985/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional photonic crystals in macroporous silicon: from mid-infrared (10 /spl mu/m) to telecommunication wavelengths (1.3-1.5 /spl mu/m)","sourcePdf":"00802985.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053615S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"36","articleId":"802985","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":802994,"authors":[{"name":"V.N.

We believe that such effects might be important for light emitting diodes. Our experiments were based on thin-film InGaAs-InP 2-D photonic crystals at ambient temperature, but the concepts would apply equally to InGaN thin films, for example. We show that the magnitude of Purcell enhancement factor, F/sub p//spl sim/2, for spatially extended band modes, is similar to that for a tiny mode in a three dimensional (3-D) nanocavity. Nonetheless, light extraction enhancement that arises from Zone folding or Bragg scattering of the photonic bands is probably the more important effect, and an external quantum efficiency >50% is possible. Angle resolved photoluminescence from inside the photonic crystal gives a direct spectral readout of the internal 2-D photonic band dispersion. The tradeoffs for employing various photonic crystal structures in high efficiency light-emitting diodes are analyzed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spontaneous emission","Photonic crystals","Transistors","Light emitting diodes","Periodic structures","Two dimensional displays","Temperature","Electromagnetic scattering","Light scattering","Particle scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photonic band gap","spontaneous emission","optical films","light emitting diodes","indium compounds","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","photoluminescence","semiconductor thin films"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spontaneous emission extraction","Purcell enhancement","thin-film 2-D photonic crystals","electromagnetic band structure","two-dimensional photonic crystal thin films","light emitting diodes","thin-film InGaAs/InP 2-D photonic crystals","Purcell enhancement factor","spatially extended band modes","light extraction enhancement","zone folding","Bragg scattering","external quantum efficiency","angle resolved photoluminescence","internal 2-D photonic band dispersion","20 C","InGaAs-InP"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.803000","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17410/00803000.pdf","startPage":"2096","endPage":"2112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.803000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spontaneous emission extraction and Purcell enhancement from thin-film 2-D photonic crystals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=803000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spontaneous emission extraction and Purcell enhancement from thin-film 2-D photonic crystals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803000/","volume":"17","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6424901","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spontaneous emission extraction and Purcell enhancement from thin-film 2-D photonic crystals","sourcePdf":"00803000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023491S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"230","articleId":"803000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":803001,"authors":[{"name":"T.

They were designed like a honeycomb photonic crystal and fabricated into GaInAsP-InP wafers by using the inductively coupled plasma etching. For the laterally directed light passing through the microcolumns, peculiar transmission characteristics were observed, which could be explained by the Bragg reflection theory, namely, the photonic bandgap (PBG). The measurement of spontaneous lifetime showed that the internal efficiency in the microcolumns was reduced by the surface recombination at sidewalls. In contrast, the light extraction efficiency evaluated from the measured photoluminescence intensity, and the internal efficiency was more than ten times that for a planar wafer. This was thought to be due to the expanded escape cone of internal light by the low effective refractive index, and also due to the strong diffraction and scattering of laterally directed light, which corresponds to the second-order Bragg condition. Such effects are expected not only in photonic crystals but also in some disordered structures. We expect this structure to allow a high-efficiency light-emitting diode (LED), since electronic elements needed for current injection devices can be added independently of the effects.","doi":"10.1109/50.803001","startPage":"2113","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17410/00803001.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.803001","endPage":"2120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strong enhancement of light extraction efficiency in GaInAsP 2-D-arranged microcolumns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803001/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Strong enhancement of light extraction efficiency in GaInAsP 2-D-arranged microcolumns","volume":"17","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6424902","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strong enhancement of light extraction efficiency in GaInAsP 2-D-arranged microcolumns","sourcePdf":"00803001.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084085S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"60","articleId":"803001","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":803008,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.

The soliton system was based on the transmission of pulses with orthogonal states of polarization (alternate polarizations) to limit the impairments due to the soliton interaction. The performance of the system operating in the field has been compared with results obtained in the laboratory. While in the laboratory the system showed a nearly-stable error-free transmission over 700 km, strong temporal fluctuations of the performance have been observed in the field trial. Numerical simulations have shown that such a degradation, and in particular the fluctuation of the Q factor, is mainly due to a polarization mode dispersion of the installed cables larger than that of the fibers used in the laboratory. However, 500 km error-free transmission was observed in the field for time interval longer than one hour, demonstrating the potentiality of a 40 Gb/s soliton system with alternate polarizations operating with long amplifier spacing (100 km) without in-line control.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.803015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17410","startPage":"2225","endPage":"2234","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17410/00803015.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Field demonstration of 40 Gb/s soliton transmission with alternate polarizations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Field demonstration of 40 Gb/s soliton transmission with alternate polarizations","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6424916","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field demonstration of 40 Gb/s soliton transmission with alternate polarizations","sourcePdf":"00803015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074456S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"23","articleId":"803015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":803016,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The premise for exploring these signal types is that they concentrate power at frequencies closer to the optical carrier where phase distortion of the optical field from chromatic dispersion is less severe. Issues such as modulator chirp, optimal level spacing in a 4-ary ASK signal, and phase modulated to amplitude modulated (PM-AM) noise conversion from a nonzero laser linewidth are studied. It is found that higher order polybinary signals do not offer an improvement in dispersion tolerance over a duobinary signal. 4-ary ASK is demonstrated to increase the dispersion-limited distance to 225 km experimentally and 350 km through simulation, but at the expense of a /spl sim/8 dB degradation in receiver sensitivity due to the increased number of levels and the signal dependence of signal-spontaneous beat noise. Furthermore, the linewidth requirement for a 4-ary ASK signal is less than 1 MHz in order to minimize the impact of PM-AM relative intensity noise (RIN) when transmitting over 200-300 km.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17410/00803016.pdf","startPage":"2235","endPage":"2248","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.803016","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.803016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17410","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=803016","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel signaling for increasing the reach of 10 Gb/s lightwave systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Amplitude shift keying","Optical modulation","Phase modulation","Optical distortion","Optical receivers","Optical sensors","Amplitude modulation","Optical noise","Chirp modulation","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre communication","digital communication","error statistics","amplitude shift keying","amplitude modulation","optical modulation","phase shift keying","telecommunication signalling","bandwidth compression","interference (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel signaling","digital lightwave systems","optical AM-PSK polybinary signalling scheme","amplitude modulated phase shift keying","M-ary ASK signaling","amplitude shift keying","polyquaternary signaling scheme","polybinary signaling scheme","single-mode fiber","optical carrier frequency","phase distortion","modulator chirp","optimal level spacing","4-ary ASK signal","PM-AM noise conversion","nonzero laser linewidth","higher order polybinary signals","dispersion tolerance","duobinary signal","receiver sensitivity degradation","signal-spontaneous beat noise","linewidth requirement","PM-AM relative intensity noise","RIN","BER","bit error rate","10 Gbit/s","1550 nm","200 to 350 km"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803016/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel signaling for increasing the reach of 10 Gb/s lightwave systems","volume":"17","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6424917","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel signaling for increasing the reach of 10 Gb/s lightwave systems","sourcePdf":"00803016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03275S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"160","articleId":"803016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":803019,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.H.

The performance of the above system is analyzed and the bit error rates of the four adaptation schemes are compared to each other and to that of the system without cancellation. Our results reveal that the proposed system is very efficient in eliminating the effect of the multiple-user interference.

We analyzed the relationship between the dimensions and material constants of a splice in a fiber butt-joint region and the force distributions along fibers, when external tensile forces or thermal stress acted on the fiber joint region. We evaluated factors relating to the slippage and these effects quantitatively. We then designed the joint region largely based on this analysis. We confirmed the joint characteristics using a temperature cycling test in accordance with the relevant Telcordia Technologies (formerly Bellcore) test specification and microscope observations of the damage to the fiber ends after the test. We achieved a highly stable mechanical splice for single fibers and four-fiber ribbons with an insertion loss change of less than /spl plusmn/0.1 dB during the test and with no damage to the fiber ends.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803023/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6424924","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"17","issue":"11","displayDocTitle":"Basic design for highly stable mechanical optical fiber splice and its development","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Basic design for highly stable mechanical optical fiber splice and its development","sourcePdf":"00803023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047352S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"3","articleId":"803023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":803033,"authors":[{"name":"E.I.

This demonstration utilizes a module which is based on cascaded semiconductor optical amplifier wavelength converters that perform the functions of label removal, label rewriting, payload 2R regeneration and double sideband subcarrier label regeneration. Replacement of double-sideband subcarrier labels on a hop-by-hop basis addresses the problem of dispersion induced fading in a multihop fiber network. A direct detection subcarrier receiver is used to recover the label. Switching over four wavelengths covering 16 nn is demonstrated with noninverting wavelength conversion of 2.5-Gb/s payloads and burst mode recovery of 10-Mb/s labels. BER measurements of better than 10/sup -9/ for the wavelength-converted payload and rewritten labels at all wavelengths are presented.","doi":"10.1109/68.803091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/17407/00803091.pdf","startPage":"1497","endPage":"1499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.803091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-optical label swapping with wavelength conversion for WDM-IP networks with subcarrier multiplexed addressing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=803091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803091/","displayDocTitle":"All-optical label swapping with wavelength conversion for WDM-IP networks with subcarrier multiplexed addressing","volume":"11","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6427574","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-optical label swapping with wavelength conversion for WDM-IP networks with subcarrier multiplexed addressing","sourcePdf":"00803091.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04698S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"87","articleId":"803091","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":803094,"authors":[{"name":"J.

These new techniques effectively improve on the complex resource sharing approaches typical of high-level synthesis algorithms, which are efficient for layout flexible ASICs but are clearly not adequate for reconfigurable devices with predefined architectures. The compilation flow takes advantage of a specialized library of circuit-generators and only resorts to logic synthesis for the generation of the data-path's control unit. The algorithms under development are being integrated onto an HW compiler that accepts programs previously compiled to Java/sup TM/ Bytecodes. A series of experiments has been performed using a number of practical examples and the results achieved so far are very promising and indicate that the RW compilation techniques proposed can provide significant improvements over currently available methods.","doi":"10.1109/SBCCI.1999.803109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBCCI.1999.803109","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The mechanics are often cited as a bandwidth limiter, but sampling frequency and computational delay also play a part in reducing the achievable bandwidth. To isolate the effects of the sampling frequency and the computational delay, the higher frequency resonances often found in disk drives were ignored, and a simple double-integrator plant model was used for the controller designs. The maximum bandwidths (assuming fixed stability margins) were calculated using two controller types, a second-order lead-lag filter and an H/sub /spl infin// controller, for a range of sampling frequencies and computational delays. The results are summarized in a scaling law that relates the bandwidth to the sampling period, delay time, and an empirically determined constant. The effects of sampling and delay on the sensitivity function, and the implications of the Bode integral theorem, are also discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hard disks","Bandwidth","Sampling methods","Delay effects","Disk drives","Servomechanisms","Resonant frequency","Resonance","Stability","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hard discs","disc drives","H/sup /spl infin control","frequency control","delays","filtering theory","sampled data systems","servomechanisms","sensitivity analysis","Bode diagrams","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hard disk drive","bandwidth limitations","sampling frequency","computational delay","second-order lead-lag filter","H/sub /spl infin// control","sampling period","delay time","Bode integral theorem","stability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AIM.1999.803153","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (Cat.

The spring strain is measured to get an accurate estimate of force. A second order linear actuator model is broken into two fundamental cases: fixed load-high force (forward transfer function), and free load-zero force (impedance). This model is presented with dimensional analysis and extends previous linear models to include friction. Using the model and dimensionless groups, we examine nonlinear effects of motor saturation as it relates to large force bandwidth and nonlinear friction effects such as stiction. The model also helps to clarify how the springs help and hinder the operation of the actuator. The information gained from the model helps to create a design procedure for series elastic actuators. Particular emphasis is placed on choosing the spring constant for the elastic element.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.1999.803231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.1999.803231","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (Cat.

Several improvements are made to correct deficiencies in the usual gradient descent NN algorithms. An adaptive learning rate is used in order to make the learning step as large as possible while avoiding oscillations. In the proposed method, the immune feedback law changes the learning rate of the NN individually and adaptively, thus the cost functional is minimized quickly and the training time is shortened. In the control structure, a reference signal self-organizing control system employing NNs and flexible micro-actuators is used. The micro-actuator is made of a bimorphic piezo-electric high polymer material (Poly Vinylidene Fluoride). The control system consists of both a plant with a feedback loop and a NN with a feedforward loop. In this system, the NN functions as a reference input filter, setting new reference signals in the closed loop system. Numerical and experimental results show that the proposed control system is effective in tracking a reference signal.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803243/","accessionNumber":"6440810","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive learning method of neural network controller using an immune feedback law","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive learning method of neural network controller using an immune feedback law","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00803243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047131S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 1999","isNumber":"17391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6508","citationCount":"18","articleId":"803243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":803274,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The axial force and the motoring torque are analyzed theoretically and the independent control for them is developed. In order to confirm the proposed technique, a motor has been made and tested. The theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm that the rotor is controlled stably by the proposed vector control and the rotating torque and the axial force can be controlled independently.","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (Cat.

The proposed method can determine the control parameters for both the feedforward and PD+D/sup 2/ feedback control based on only an estimated dominant second-order model. The RBF compensator is a form of self-tuning control which compensate for remaining uncertainties in the system, residual of the linear model.

This paper presents an approximate analysis, validated by computer simulations, for TCP performance over wireless links. The analysis provides the basis for a systematic approach to supporting TCP over wireless links. The specific case of a Rayleigh-faded wireless link and automatic repeat request-based link-layer recovery is considered for the purpose of illustration.

Whenever a mobile has class-II messages to transmit, the mobile requests code channels via a base station-oriented transmission-request code channel, then, according to the base station scheduling, the transmission is scheduled and permitted. Addressed are the admission test for class-I connections, transmission power allocation, and how to maximize the aggregate throughput for class-II traffic. The admission region of voice and video connections and the optimum target signal-to-interference ratio of class-II traffic are derived numerically. The performance of class-II traffic transmissions in terms of average delay is also evaluated and discussed.","doi":"10.1109/90.803378","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/17436/00803378.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.803378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17436","startPage":"616","endPage":"628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An uplink CDMA system architecture with diverse QoS guarantees for heterogeneous traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=803378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An uplink CDMA system architecture with diverse QoS guarantees for heterogeneous traffic","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803378/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6414944","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An uplink CDMA system architecture with diverse QoS guarantees for heterogeneous traffic","sourcePdf":"00803378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100676S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"57","articleId":"803378","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":803379,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, there is still considerable debate about how to model such processes and about their impact on network and application performance. In this paper, we argue that much previous modeling work has failed to consider the impact of two important parameters, namely the finite range of time scales of interest in performance evaluation and prediction problems, and the first-order statistics such as the marginal distribution of the process. We introduce and evaluate a model in which these parameters can be controlled. Specifically, our model is a modulated fluid traffic model in which the correlation function of the fluid rate matches that of an asymptotically second-order self-similar process with given Hurst parameter up to an arbitrary cutoff time lag, then drops to zero. We develop a very efficient numerical procedure to evaluate the performance of a single-server queue fed with the above fluid input process. We use this procedure to examine the fluid loss rate for a wide range of marginal distributions, Hurst (1950) parameters, cutoff lags, and buffer sizes. Our main results are as follows. First, we find that the amount of correlation that needs to be taken into account for performance evaluation depends not only on the correlation structure of the source traffic, but also on time scales specific to the system under study. For example, the time scale associated with a queueing system is a function of the maximum buffer size. Thus, for finite buffer queues, we find that the impact on loss of the correlation in the arrival process becomes nil beyond a time scale we refer to as the correlation horizon. This means, in particular, that for performance-modeling purposes, we may choose any model among the panoply of available models (including Markovian and self-similar models) as long as the chosen model captures the correlation structure of the source traffic up to the correlation horizon. Second, we find that loss can depend in a crucial way on the marginal distribution of the fluid rate process. Third, our results suggest that reducing loss by buffering is hard for traffic with correlation over many time scales. We advocate the use of source traffic control and statistical multiplexing instead.","doi":"10.1109/90.803379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.803379","endPage":"640","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/17436/00803379.pdf","startPage":"629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the relevance of long-range dependence in network traffic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803379/","displayDocTitle":"On the relevance of long-range dependence in network traffic","volume":"7","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"6414945","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the relevance of long-range dependence in network traffic","sourcePdf":"00803379.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084109S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"165","articleId":"803379","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":803380,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The existing distributed routing algorithms fall into two major categories: preferred neighbor based or flooding based. The preferred neighbor approach offers a better call acceptance rate, whereas the flooding approach is better in terms of call setup time and routing distance. The proposed approach attempts to combine the benefits of both preferred neighbor and flooding approaches in a way to improve all the three performance metrics simultaneously. This is achieved by probing k different paths in parallel, for a channel, by employing different heuristics on each path. Also, the proposed approach uses a notion called intermediate destinations (IDs), which are subset of nodes along the least-cost path between source and destination of a call, in order to reduce the excessive resource reservations while probing for a channel by releasing unused resources between IDs and initiating parallel probes at every ID. Further, it has the flexibility of adapting to different load conditions by its nature of using different heuristics in parallel, and hence, a path found for a channel would have different segments (a segment is a path between two successive IDs), and each of these segments would very well be selected by different heuristics. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been studied through simulation for well-known network topologies for a wide range of quality-of-service and traffic parameters. The simulation results reveal that the average call acceptance rate offered by the proposed route-selection approach is better than that of both the flooding and preferred neighbor approaches, and the average call setup time and routing distance offered by it are very close to that of the flooding approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Quality of service","Floods","Routing","Computer science","Network topology","Telecommunication traffic","Measurement","Probes","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication network routing","network topology","telecommunication traffic","parallel processing","quality of service","telecommunication channels","packet switching","data communication","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed route selection","real-time networks","parallel probing","real-time channel establishment","point-to-point network","distributed routing algorithms","performance metrics","flooding based approach","preferred neighbor approach","intermediate destinations","least-cost path","nodes","resource reservations","load conditions","heuristics","QoS","network topologies","quality-of-service","traffic parameters","simulation results","average call acceptance rate","average call setup time","routing distance","packet switched data networks"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.803384","startPage":"698","endPage":"709","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/17436/00803384.pdf","doi":"10.1109/90.803384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new distributed route selection approach for channel establishment in real-time networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"A new distributed route selection approach for channel establishment in real-time networks","accessionNumber":"6414950","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","volume":"7","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new distributed route selection approach for channel establishment in real-time networks","sourcePdf":"00803384.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042133S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17436","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"23","articleId":"803384","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":803390,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA"],"lastName":"Ling Li","id":"37280698300"},{"name":"A.K.

However, at low frequencies (60/50 Hz), it is a bulky and expensive component. In this paper, the concept of electronic transformers is further extended and explored for its suitability in power distribution systems. It should be noted that from the input/output behavior, the electronic transformer and the conventional transformer are identical. Possible topologies employing static converters connected on the primary and secondary sides are explored to realize high-frequency operation of the magnetic core. To assist the commutation process, a four-step switching has been developed which does not require the use of snubbers. Reduced size, losses, higher efficiency, and better voltage regulation are some of the advantages of this approach. A 10 kVA design example along with experiment results are discussed. It is shown that a transformer designed with a conventional grain-oriented silicon-steel core can process three times the power at 1 kHz operating frequency as compared to 60 Hz. The proposed method is scalable in voltage/current with the currently available insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) devices connected in series without special snubbers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803407/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","volume":"14","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6427130","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and design of electronic transformers for electric power distribution system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and design of electronic transformers for electric power distribution system","sourcePdf":"00803407.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.022101S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"244","articleId":"803407","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":803411,"authors":[{"name":"Chein-I Chang","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Signal and Image Processing Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Chein-I Chang","id":"37276904900"},{"name":"Qian Du","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Signal and Image Processing Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Qian Du","id":"37267187900"},{"name":"Tzu-Lung Sun","affiliation":["Remote Sensing Signal and Image Processing Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Tzu-Lung Sun","id":"37437942500"},{"name":"M.L.G.

Many criteria have been suggested in the past for optimal band selection. In this paper, a joint band-prioritization and band-decorrelation approach to band selection is considered for hyperspectral image classification. The proposed band prioritization is a method based on the eigen (spectral) decomposition of a matrix from which a loading-factors matrix can be constructed for band prioritization via the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Two approaches are presented, principal components analysis (PCA)-based criteria and classification-based criteria. The former includes the maximum-variance PCA and maximum SNR PCA, whereas the latter derives the minimum misclassification canonical analysis (MMCA) (i.e., Fisher's discriminant analysis) and subspace projection-based criteria. Since the band prioritization does not take spectral correlation into account, an information-theoretic criterion called divergence is used for band decorrelation. Finally, the band selection can then be done by an eigenanalysis based band prioritization in conjunction with a divergence-based band decorrelation. It is shown that the proposed band-selection method effectively eliminates a great number of insignificant bands. Surprisingly, the experiments show that with a proper band selection, less than 0.1 of the total number of bands can achieve comparable performance using the number of full bands. This further demonstrates that the band selection can significantly reduce data volume so as to achieve data compression.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote

angle synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging has applications in specific situations such as providing looking angle-dependent scattering information and revisiting an area of interest. It is very difficult for current SAR-imaging algorithms to be used directly in high-squint configurations. This is due to the large range-cell migration and the nonnegligible cubic-phase term in the signal. In this paper, an improved algorithm called the time-varying step-transform algorithm is proposed. It uses different chirp rates to deramp the signal in different subapertures to alleviate the range-focus problem. The interval between subapertures is also varied according to the deramping chirp rate. The nonnegligible cubic-phase term is included in the focusing procedure. The performance of the proposed algorithm in high-squint-angle mode is excellent. By reducing the subaperture length as the squint angle is increased, the performance of the algorithm is almost independent of squint angle. The proposed algorithm is also flexible for multilook processing and motion-error compensation.","doi":"10.1109/36.803414","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/17434/00803414.pdf","startPage":"2668","endPage":"2677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.803414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Time-varying step-transform algorithm for high squint SAR imaging","volume":"37","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6435334","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803414/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-varying step-transform algorithm for high squint SAR imaging","sourcePdf":"00803414.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038265S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"29","articleId":"803414","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":803416,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Typically, numerical techniques that are well suited for modeling the antennas themselves are not well suited for modeling the heterogeneous grounds, and visa versa. For example the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique is well suited for modeling fields in heterogeneous media, whereas the method of moments (MoM) is well suited for modeling complex antennas in free space. This paper describes a hybrid technique, based upon the equivalence principle, for calculating an antenna's current distribution radiation pattern when the antenna is located near an air-ground interface. The original problem is decomposed into two coupled equivalent problems: one for the antenna geometry and the other for the ground geometry, with field information passing between them via a rapidly converging iterative procedure. The fields in each region may be modeled using numerical techniques best suited to them. Results for several test cases are presented, using FDTD to model the ground problem and MoM for the antenna problem, that demonstrate the accuracy of this hybrid technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FDTD/MoM hybrid technique for modeling complex antennas in the presence of heterogeneous grounds","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.803416","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/17434/00803416.pdf","startPage":"2692","endPage":"2698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.803416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=803416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803416/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"An FDTD/MoM hybrid technique for modeling complex antennas in the presence of heterogeneous grounds","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6435336","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FDTD/MoM hybrid technique for modeling complex antennas in the presence of heterogeneous grounds","sourcePdf":"00803416.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030395S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"43","articleId":"803416","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":803418,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This dependence has limited the success of material-identification algorithms that rely on hyperspectral image data without associated ground-truth information. In this paper, the authors use a comprehensive physical model to show that the set of observed 0.4-2.5 /spl mu/m spectral-radiance vectors for a material lies in a low-dimensional subspace of the hyperspectral-measurement space. The physical model captures the dependence of the reflected sunlight, reflected skylight, and path-radiance terms on the scene geometry and on the distribution of atmospheric gases and aerosols over a wide range of conditions. Using the subspace model, they develop a local maximum-likelihood algorithm for automated material identification that is invariant to illumination, atmospheric conditions, and the scene geometry. The algorithm requires only the spectral reflectance of the target material as input. The authors show that the low dimensionality of material subspaces allows for the robust discrimination of a large number of materials over a wide range of conditions. They demonstrate the invariant algorithm for the automated identification of material samples in HYDICE imagery acquired under different illumination and atmospheric conditions.","doi":"10.1109/36.803418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.803418","endPage":"2717","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/17434/00803418.pdf","startPage":"2706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Models and methods for automated material identification in hyperspectral imagery acquired under unknown illumination and atmospheric conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803418/","displayDocTitle":"Models and methods for automated material identification in hyperspectral imagery acquired under unknown illumination and atmospheric conditions","volume":"37","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6435338","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Models and methods for automated material identification in hyperspectral imagery acquired under unknown illumination and atmospheric conditions","sourcePdf":"00803418.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096134S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"137","articleId":"803418","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":803419,"authors":[{"name":"Yuei-An Liou","affiliation":["Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research and the Institute of Space Science, National Central University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuei-An Liou","id":"37087151523"},{"name":"Y.C.

Predictions from the LSP/R model are used to train the DLNN and serve as the reference for evaluation of the DLNN retrievals. Both horizontally polarized and vertically polarized brightnesses at 1.4 GHz, 19 GHz, and 37 GHz for an incidence angle of 53/spl deg/ make up the input nodes of the DLNN. The corresponding output nodes are composed of land-surface parameters, canopy temperature and water content, and soil temperature and moisture (uppermost 5 mm). Under no-noise conditions, the maximum of the root mean-square (RMS) errors between the retrieved parameters of interest and their corresponding reference from the LSP/R model is smaller than 28 for a four-channel case with 19 GHz and 37 GHz brightnesses as the inputs of the DLNN. The maximum RMS error is reduced to within 0.5% if additional 1.4 GHz brightnesses are used (a six-channel case). This indicates that the DLNN produces negligible errors onto its retrievals. For the realization of the problem, two different levels of noises are added to the input nodes. The noises are assumed to be Gaussian distributed with standard deviations of 1 K and 2 K. The maximum RMS errors are increased to 9.3% and 10.3% for the 1 K-noise and 2 K-noise cases, respectively, for the four-channel ease. They are reduced to 6.0% and 9.1% for the 1 K-noise and 2 K-noise cases, respectively, for the six-channel case. This is an implication that 1.4 GHz is a better frequency in probing soil parameters than 19 GHz and 37 GHz.","doi":"10.1109/36.803419","startPage":"2718","endPage":"2724","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.803419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17434","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/17434/00803419.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural-network approach to radiometric sensing of land-surface parameters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803419/","displayDocTitle":"A neural-network approach to radiometric sensing of land-surface parameters","volume":"37","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6435339","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural-network approach to radiometric sensing of land-surface parameters","sourcePdf":"00803419.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041393S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"23","articleId":"803419","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":803428,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A graded mesh algorithm and lossy absorbing boundary condition are proposed and adopted in the 2-D FDTD analysis to reduce the number of spatial grid points in the simulation region. The introduction of time signal prediction technique to predict the future signal in the time domain or extract the parameters in the frequency domain of uniform transmission lines reduces the computation time drastically. With these, the substrate and conductor losses are both included in one analysis. This algorithm leads to a significant reduction in CPU time and storage requirements as compared with the conventional FDTD.

We describe the circuits implementing the sensor and show applications to three examples of tracking tasks: a stand-alone visual tracking system, an active fully analog tracking system, and a mobile platform line-following system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuromorphic analog VLSI sensor for visual tracking: circuits and application examples","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/82.803473","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/17431/00803473.pdf","startPage":"1337","endPage":"1347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.803473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17431","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=803473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803473/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Neuromorphic analog VLSI sensor for visual tracking: circuits and application examples","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6437877","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuromorphic analog VLSI sensor for visual tracking: circuits and application examples","sourcePdf":"00803473.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038238S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"57","articleId":"803473","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":803478,"authors":[{"name":"G.

First, it is shown that all analysis and synthesis filters-obtained by appropriate complex modulation of a low-pass prototype filter-are linear phase. This is important for subband image coding applications. Another important property is the structure-inherent alias cancellation: all odd alias spectra are automatically compensated in the synthesis filter bank. Further, the MDFT filter bank provides perfect reconstruction for the same prototypes as for cosine-modulated filter banks. Thus, the same design methods can be used. Finally, different mappings of the input signal into the subbands are discussed and a comparison to the well-known cosine-modulated filter banks is given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803480/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","volume":"46","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"6437884","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modified DFT filter banks with perfect reconstruction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified DFT filter banks with perfect reconstruction","sourcePdf":"00803480.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045174S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"137","articleId":"803480","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":803488,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A usual practice in CDMA systems for matching of rate is based on repeating the encoder output bits. This feature can be used to provide UPA with a negligible increase in the complexity.

One of the main goals is to show how reliability information on each received bit can be derived to enable soft-decision decoding. Convolutional codes as well as turbo codes are considered applying soft-decision, erasure, and hard-decision decoding. Their performance is compared to that of previously proposed Reed-Solomon with either errors-only or errors-and-erasures decoding. A mobile radio environment yielding a frequency-selective fading channel is assumed. It is shown that the application of turbo codes and convolutional codes with soft decision decoding can allow for a comparable number of simultaneously transmitting users to Reed-Solomon codes with errors-and-erasures decoding. Furthermore, the advantage of soft decisions is shown, which can be applied to a widely and growing range of channel codes. The pertinent technique of calculating soft decisions is described in the paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17429/00803499.pdf","startPage":"1646","endPage":"1654","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.803499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.803499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=803499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-decision and erasure decoding in fast frequency-hopping systems with convolutional, turbo, and Reed-Solomon codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood decoding","Frequency shift keying","Convolutional codes","Turbo codes","Encoding","Land mobile radio","Transmitters","Frequency-selective fading channels","Mobile communication","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency shift keying","convolutional codes","turbo codes","telecommunication network reliability","fading channels","frequency hop communication","Reed-Solomon codes","decoding","multi-access systems","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["erasure decoding","fast frequency-hopping systems","Reed-Solomon codes","multiple frequency shift keying multiple-access systems","reliability information","soft-decision decoding","turbo codes","convolutional codes","hard-decision decoding","performance","errors-only decoding","errors-and-erasures decoding","mobile radio","frequency-selective fading channel","channel codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Soft-decision and erasure decoding in fast frequency-hopping systems with convolutional, turbo, and Reed-Solomon codes","volume":"47","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6425948","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-decision and erasure decoding in fast frequency-hopping systems with convolutional, turbo, and Reed-Solomon codes","sourcePdf":"00803499.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034149S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"31","articleId":"803499","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":803500,"authors":[{"name":"A.F.

In this paper, two novel orthogonal-based modulation schemes are introduced for the DSL environment. In the first technique, the conventional two-dimensional (2-D) CAP-16 line code is extended to a three-dimensional (3-D) scheme. The 3-D system is designed so that the new overall transfer matrix maintains perfect reconstruction (PR) of the transmitted information. The system is designed by solving a minimax optimization problem by using the sequential quadratic programming algorithm; this searches the whole space of signals under the PR condition and the DSL constraints. The 3-D CAP system leads to a 50% increase in throughput at the expense of the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation by 3-4 dB. It should be noted that this increase in throughput can also be achieved by a CAP-64 system. Nevertheless, the dynamic range of the proposed 3-D CAP approach is 7.4 dB less than CAP-64, which leads to faster equalization. Furthermore, the equalizer performance in the 3-D case is 1-3 dB better, depending on channel and noise considerations. Another application of the multidimensional CAP approach, referred to as orthogonality division multiple access (ODMA) is presented. In this approach, the CAP system is extended to more than three dimensions by maintaining the same overall symbol rate as in the 2-D case. The ODMA system allows multiple-access operation of the DSL communication link with minimal hardware penalty. The performance of the ODMA system for the multiple-access environment is found to match the conventional 2-D CAP, allowing suitable multiple-access topology with minimal complexity overhead. The ODMA system complexity is compared with discrete multitone and is found to have 25% less complexity for the same bit rate. Theoretical analysis of the ODMA system using zero-forcing equalization shows that the equalization process yields better SNR as the number of dimensions increases, asymptotically approaching the intersymbol interference-free matched filter bound.","doi":"10.1109/26.803500","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17429/00803500.pdf","startPage":"1655","endPage":"1667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.803500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional carrierless AM/PM systems for digital subscriber loops","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=803500","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803500/","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional carrierless AM/PM systems for digital subscriber loops","volume":"47","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6425949","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional carrierless AM/PM systems for digital subscriber loops","sourcePdf":"00803500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056617S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"45","articleId":"803500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":803501,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper considers the additional impact of various forms of narrow-band interference on the performance of these two systems and the ability of the multicarrier system to effectively suppress the interference using the innate structure of its receiver. At roughly equivalent receiver complexity, results demonstrate superior performance of the multicarrier system in the presence of such interference, without requiring the addition of a front-end interference suppression filter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Multiaccess communication","Fading","Interference suppression","Filters","Narrowband","Convolution","Multiple access interference","Bandwidth","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","interference suppression","fading channels","multipath channels","code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","radiofrequency interference","convolutional codes","synchronisation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutionally coded multicarrier DS-CDMA systems","multipath fading channel","narrow-band interference suppression","asynchronous direct-sequence code-division multiple-access system","RAKE receiver","additive white Gaussian noise","multiple-access interference","performance","multicarrier system","receiver complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=803508","doi":"10.1109/26.803508","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17429/00803508.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.803508","startPage":"1729","endPage":"1736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutionally coded multicarrier DS-CDMA systems in a multipath fading channel.

An optimal design methodology is developed for the problem of minimizing the multiple-access interference power under various desirable signal constraints, including limited 99% and 99.9% power bandwidth occupancies, continuous signal phase, and near-constant envelope. The methodology is based on the use of prolate spheroidal wave functions to obtain a reduced-dimension discrete constrained optimization problem formulation. Numerous design examples are discussed to compare the performance achieved by the optimally-designed chip waveforms with other conventional schemes, such as offset quadrature phase-shift keying, minimum-shift keying (MSK), sinusoidal frequency-shift keying (SFSK), and time-domain raised-cosine pulses. In general, it is found that while the optimized chip pulses achieved substantial gains when no envelope constraints were imposed, these gains vanish when a low envelope fluctuation constraint was introduced. In particular, it is also shown that MSK is quasi-optimal with regard to the 99% bandwidth measure, while the raised-cosine pulse is equally good with both the 99% and 99.9% measures, but at the expense of some envelope variation. On the other hand, SFSK is quasi-optimal with regard to the 99.9% bandwidth occupancy, among the class of constant-to-low envelope variation pulses.","doi":"10.1109/26.803509","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"1737","endPage":"1746","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17429/00803509.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.803509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DS-CDMA chip waveform design for minimal interference under bandwidth, phase, and envelope constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Bandwidth","Pulse measurements","Interference constraints","Constraint optimization","Particle measurements","Modulation","Design methodology","Multiple access interference","Wave functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-CDMA chip waveform design","minimal interference","bandwidth constraint","phase constraint","envelope constraint","waveform shaping","error performance","direct-sequence code-division multiple-access communication systems","offset quadrature modulation formats","optimal design","multiple-access interference","signal constraints","prolate spheroidal wave functions","reduced-dimension discrete constrained optimization problem","optimally-designed chip waveforms","optimized chip pulses","MSK","raised-cosine pulse","SFSK","sinusoidal frequency-shift keying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"DS-CDMA chip waveform design for minimal interference under bandwidth, phase, and envelope constraints","volume":"47","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6425957","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803509/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DS-CDMA chip waveform design for minimal interference under bandwidth, phase, and envelope constraints","sourcePdf":"00803509.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039471S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"65","articleId":"803509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":803510,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The average bit-error rate analysis applies to phase coded spread-spectrum systems, over Nakagami multipath fading channels. A simple and practical selection combining rule is considered. Our numerical results reveal that this new low-complexity receiver structure exhibits comparable performance to that of an optimum linear diversity combiner when the channel does not experience severe fading and for small diversity orders, conditioned on the situation that all the diversity branches have identical mean signal strengths. In this study, we also investigate the effect of variations in the mean signal and noise power levels on each of the independent diversity branches. This is an important consideration because in practice equal mean signal strengths rarely occur, which results in loss of diversity gain. We found that the signal-plus-noise-and-interference selection model outperforms the traditional signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio selection scheme if the discrepancy between the mean signal strengths are small, owing to the statistical nature of the multiple-access interference.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17429/00803510.pdf","startPage":"1747","endPage":"1756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.803510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.803510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17429","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=803510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microdiversity reception of spread-spectrum signals on Nakagami fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Diversity reception","Fading","Performance analysis","Land mobile radio","Bit error rate","Receivers","Noise level","Diversity methods","Multiple access interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile radio","fading channels","diversity reception","spread spectrum communication","error statistics","multipath channels","phase coding","radio receivers","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microdiversity reception","spread-spectrum signals","Nakagami fading channels","performance","predetection diversity techniques","mobile radio environments","bit-error rate analysis","phase coded spread-spectrum systems","selection combining rule","low-complexity receiver structure","diversity branches","signal-plus-noise-and-interference selection model","multiple-access interference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Microdiversity reception of spread-spectrum signals on Nakagami fading channels","volume":"47","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6425958","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microdiversity reception of spread-spectrum signals on Nakagami fading channels","sourcePdf":"00803510.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045066S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","articleId":"803510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":803524,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The automation of this approach is supported by a compiler front-end and by an HW compiler under development. The front-end starts from the Java bytecodes and, therefore, supports any language that can be compiled to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) model. It extracts from the bytecodes all the dependencies inside and between basic blocks. This information is stored in representation graphs more suitable to efficiently exploit the existent parallelism in the program than those typically used in high-level synthesis. From the intermediate representations the HW compiler exploits the temporal partitions at the behavior level, resolves memory access conflicts, and generates the VHDL descriptions at register-transfer level that will be mapped into the reconfigurable HW devices.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (Cat.

The method improves efficiency and ease of development of reconfigurable designs, particularly for users with little electronics design experience. We propose several loop transformations to customize pipelines to meet hardware resource constraints, while maximising available parallelism. For ran-time reconfigurable systems, we apply hardware specialization to increase circuit utilization. Our approach is especially effective for highly repetitive computations in DSP and multimedia applications. Case studies using FPGA-based platforms are presented to demonstrate the benefits of our approach and to evaluate trade-offs between alternative implementations. The loop tiling transformation, for instance, has been found to improve performance by 30 to 40 times above a PC-based software implementation, depending on whether run-time reconfiguration is used.","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1999.803667","publicationTitle":"Seventh Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (Cat.

These memories may be on-board embedded SRAMs or discrete parts. In the process of mapping a computation onto an FPGA processor, it is necessary to map the applications' data to memories. In this work, we present an algorithm that has been implemented in our NAPA C compiler to assign data automatically to memories to produce minimum overall execution time of the loops in the program. With the addition of this algorithm to our compiler, the programmer need not explicitly annotate array declarations with location information. Rather, the compiler analyzes the usage patterns of variables and selects the optimal location for each variable. The algorithm uses a search technique known as implicit enumeration to reduce the otherwise exponential search space. In practice, the use of this memory allocation compiler phase in our SUIF-based NAPA C compiler has negligible effect on compiler run time.","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1999.803668","publicationTitle":"Seventh Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (Cat.

In order to build these systems, designers will need high-level compilation and CAD tools that generate architectures that effectively meet the needs of each application. In this paper we present a novel compilation system that allows sequential programs, written in C or FORTRAN, to be compiled directly into custom silicon or reconfigurable architectures. This capability is also interesting because trends in computer architecture are moving towards more reconfigurable hardware-like substrates, such as FPGA based systems. Our system works by successfully combining two resource-efficient computing disciplines: Small Memories and Virtual Wires. For a given application, the compiler first analyzes the memory access patterns of pointers and arrays in the program and constructs a partitioned memory system made up of many small memories. The computation is implemented by active computing elements that are spatially distributed within the memory array. A space-time scheduler assigns instructions to the computing elements in a way that maximizes locality and minimizes physical communication distance. It also generates an efficient static schedule for the interconnect. Finally, specialized hardware for the resulting schedule of memory accesses, wires, and computation is generated as a multi-process state machine in synthesizable Verilog. With this system, implemented as a set of SUIF compiler passes, we have successfully compiled programs into hardware and achieve specialization performance enhancements by up to an order of magnitude versus a single general purpose processor. We also achieve additional parallelization speedups similar to those obtainable using a tightly-interconnected multiprocessor.","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1999.803669","startPage":"70","publicationTitle":"Seventh Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (Cat.

We also present a RISC micro-architecture enhanced by a CPLD-based Reconfigurable Functional Unit (RFU) which supports our compiler approach. The main difference between our smart compiler and similar methods is the ability to encode multiple custom instructions in a single RFU configuration, cross-minimising the logic among them. The objective is to reduce (or eliminate) the reconfiguration overhead and optimise the utilisation of resources. The CPLD core that implements the RFU is based on the Philips XPLA2 architecture. We discuss the advantages of using the XPLA2 instead of conventional FPGAs. Application examples are also presented, which show that our RFU-extended CPU can achieve speed-ups of more than 40% for encryption algorithms, when compared to the standard CPU core alone.","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1999.803671","publicationTitle":"Seventh Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (Cat.

An algorithm for generating MCMTs has been developed and implemented, which is based on a novel representation of common subexpressions in constant data patterns. Our optimization framework covers a wider solution space than previous approaches; it also supports exploitation of full and partial run-time reconfiguration as well as technology-specific constraints, such as fanout limits and routing. We demonstrate that while distributed arithmetic techniques require storage size exponential in the number of coefficients, the resource utilization of MCMTs usually grows linearly with problem size. MCMTs have been implemented in Xilinx 4000 and Virtex FPGAs, and their size and speed efficiency are confirmed in comparisons with Xilinx LogiCore and ASIC implementations of FIR filter designs. Preliminary results show that the size of MCMT circuits is less than half of that of comparable distributed arithmetic cores.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing FPGA-based vector product designs","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1999.803680","startPage":"188","endPage":"197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.1999.803680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17422","publicationTitle":"Seventh Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (Cat.

This architecture is well suited for the implementation of public-key cryptosystems which require programmable multipliers in large Galois fields. The architecture trades a reduction in resources with an increase in the number of clock cycles. This architecture is also fine grain scalable in both the time and the area (or logic) dimensions thus facilitating implementations that maximize their use of finite FPGA resources while achieving fast computational speed. This leads to an architecture that requires less resources than traditional bit serial multipliers, which we demonstrated with implementations of multipliers in the field GF(2/sup 167/). Our results demonstrate that for this field one can realize super-serial multipliers that use 2.76 times fewer function generators and 6.84 times fewer flip-flops than their serial multiplier counterparts. We also extrapolated the performance of these multipliers in an elliptic curve cryptosystem.","publicationTitle":"Seventh Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (Cat.

We show how the precision requirements can be analyzed for typical computations in loops by computing the precision variation curve.

In this paper we develop new compression algorithms for FPGA configurations that can significantly reduce this overhead. By using runlength and other compression techniques, files can be compressed by a factor of 3.6 times. Bus transfer and decompression hardware are also discussed. This results in a single compression methodology which achieves higher compression ratios than existing algorithms in an off-line version, as well as a somewhat lower quality compression approach which is suitable for on-line use in dynamic circuit generation and other mapping-time critical situations.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (Cat.

There are still many challenging problems to be solved before any practical general-purpose reconfigurable system is built. One fundamental issue is the placement of the modules on the reconfigurable functional unit (RFU). In this paper we present an online heuristic placement method with overall O(n log n) space complexity and O(log n) time complexity for each insertion/deletion of modules on the RFU chip, n being the number of modules currently on the RFU. Our proposed method is O(n) faster than an algorithm which considers all possible locations for placing a new module, but as experimental results show its quality is 7% worse.","displayPublicationTitle":"Seventh Annual IEEE Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (Cat.

The SAT solver presented by Zhong et al. (1998) has a large compilation time overhead mainly due to placement and routing of many FPGAs. We attack the problem on three fronts. First, we partition the SAT solver into instance-specific and instance non-specific components. Secondly, we transform SAT instances into canonical forms; and finally we present a board-level multiple-chip architecture to solve large SAT instances. All these efforts amount to a reduction in placement and routing time to configure the configurable hardware.

By electronically tuning the active feedback of the amplifier, a 3.5 dB improvement in IP3 over a broadband is obtained compared to a purely resistive feedback design with the same do power. At an optimal tuning bias, the amplifier achieves a DC-3 GHz bandwidth, 9.5 dB gain, a P/sub 1dB/ of 13.3 dBm, and an IP3 of 31 dBm at 1 GHz while consuming a modest 35 mA through a 5 V supply. An lP3/P/sub DC/ ratio of 6.6:1 is achieved which is more than double that obtained from an equivalent conventional resistive feedback design. The improved linearity is obtained with no substantial impact on the MMIC size or DC power consumption. Under large signal operation the amplifier was also found to obtain 14-15 dB improvement in C/IM3 ratio. This simple MMIC technique is a cost effective means for improving the performance of standard linear MMIC products.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linearity","Indium phosphide","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Feedback","Broadband amplifiers","MMICs","Power amplifiers","Bandwidth","Gain","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indium compounds","III-V semiconductors","wideband amplifiers","MMIC amplifiers","bipolar MMIC","heterojunction bipolar transistors","feedback amplifiers","circuit tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tunable linearity characteristics","InP HBT active feedback amplifier","tunable active feedback","electronic tuning","broadband operation","MMIC","power consumption","large signal operation","3 GHz","9.5 dB","35 mA","5 V","InP"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GAAS.1999.803777","publicationTitle":"GaAs IC Symposium.

Industrial drawings are among the most important documents used during the lifetime of industrial environments. They are the only common documents used during design, installation, monitoring and control, maintenance, update and finally dismantling of industrial units. Leading traditional industries towards the full use of virtual and augmented reality technology is impossible unless industrial drawings are integrated into our systems. We provide the missing link between industrial drawings and digital images of industrial sites. On one hand, this could enable us to calibrate cameras and build a 3D model of the scene without using any calibration markers. On the other hand it brings industrial drawings, floor map, images and 3D models into one unified framework. This provides a solid foundation for building efficient enhanced virtual industrial environments. The augmented scene is obtained by perspective warping of an industrial drawing of the factory onto its floor, wherever the floor is visible. The visibility of the floor is determined using probabilistic reasoning over a set of clues including (1) floor color/intensity (2) image warping and differencing between an uncalibrated stereoscopic image pair using the ground plane homography. Experimental results illustrate the approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/803813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"20-21 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6423150","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Scene augmentation via the fusion of industrial drawings and uncalibrated images with a view to marker-less calibration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scene augmentation via the fusion of industrial drawings and uncalibrated images with a view to marker-less calibration","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00803813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034696S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523","citationCount":"26","articleId":"803813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":803949,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The final design is composed of a PIC16C76 microcontroller, the MicroStamp Engine 2.45 GHz transceiver IC, and two AD620 low power instrumentation amplifiers. This is the highest frequency evaluated for a biotelemetry system known to the authors. The circuit performs an 8-bit A/D conversion on two input channels and serially relays the converted data to the MicroStamp Engine, which transmits the data to a PC at 2.45 GHz. The system was tested using triangular wave input signals of various frequencies and amplitudes.

The method is shown to be particularly useful with signals that are difficult to analyze with currently used histogram-based methods. The DWT is used as a preprocessing tool before computing the signals' amplitude histograms and estimating the current statistics. Six signals are analyzed using various mother wavelets. The DWT is used to extract approximations of the signals at varying scales. The channel current statistics are estimated for the original signal, as well as the wavelet approximations. The estimates are compared to the \"true\" statistical values.

Macro Test is a liberal test approach for core-based designs, i.e., it supports all kinds of test access mechanisms to the embedded cores. The separation of tests into test protocols and test patterns plays a crucial role in Macro Test. Tasks as expansion of core-level tests to chip level, scheduling of tests, and test assembly are carried out on test protocols by software tools. This paper addresses the role of test protocols and features an example of a small scan-testable core. We argue that the fact that expansion and scheduling take place on test protocols rather than on complete tests is important to reduce the computational complexity of the associated software tools.","doi":"10.1109/ETW.1999.804248","publicationTitle":"European Test Workshop 1999 (Cat.

Encouraging results were obtained in terms of Correct Classification Rate (CCR) and Average Squared Error (ASE) and the adult model could be successfully applied to neonatal patients.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/804395/","accessionNumber":"6521218","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Estimating ventilation using artificial neural networks in intensive care units","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimating ventilation using artificial neural networks in intensive care units","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"00804395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033837S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6513","citationCount":"4","articleId":"804395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":804406,"authors":[{"name":"C.M.

The proposed approach concerns the XILINX4000 family. On this example of FPGA, a classical test technique consists in first generating test configurations for the elementary modules, then test configurations for a single logic cell, and finally test configurations for the m/spl times/m array of logic cells. In this classical technique, it is shown that the key point is the minimization of the number of test configurations for a logic cell. An approach for the logic cell of the XILINX4000 family is then described to define a minimum number of test configurations. This approach gives only 5 test configurations for the XILINX4000 family while the previous published works concerning Boolean testing of this FPGA family gives 8 or 21 test configurations.","doi":"10.1109/ETW.1999.804520","publicationTitle":"European Test Workshop 1999 (Cat.

OMNeT++ is a C++-based discrete event simulator which uses the process-interaction approach. An OMNeT++ model consists of modules communicating by message passing. Modules can be arbitrarily nested. Model topology is specified by a topology description language which supports separation of interface and functionality and facilitates model reuse. One of the strengths of OMNeT++ is that one can execute the simulation under a powerful graphical user interface. The GUI makes the internals of a simulation model fully visible to the person running the simulation: it displays the network graphics, animates the message flow and lets the user peek into objects and variables within the model. The use of the tracing/debugging capabilities does not require extra code to be written by the simulation programmer. The combination of these features make OMNeT++ a good choice for use in the education. OMNeT++ is open-source and free for non-profit use. The CD-ROM contains the full source distribution, the manual in HTML format, and a Win95/NT executable with several sample simulation models and their sources.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/804564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6445862","displayDocTitle":"Using the OMNeT++ discrete event simulation system in education","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the OMNeT++ discrete event simulation system in education","sourcePdf":"00804564.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028649S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"206","articleId":"804564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":804572,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The algorithm has been employed to predict experimental cardiovascular time series, following systematic reconstruction of the strange attractor of the training signal. Comparison with a standard MLP employing identical numbers of nodes and weight learning rates demonstrates that the adaptive approach provides an efficient modification of the MLP that permits faster learning. Thus, for an equivalent number of training epochs there was improved accuracy and generalization for both one- and k-step ahead prediction. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated for a set of monotonic postsynaptic functions (sigmoidal, upper bounded, and nonbounded). The approach is computationally inexpensive as the increase in the parameter space of the network compared to a standard MLP is small.","doi":"10.1109/10.804572","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/17446/00804572.pdf","startPage":"1441","endPage":"1453","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.804572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Forecasting chaotic cardiovascular time series with an adaptive slope multilayer perceptron neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/804572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Forecasting chaotic cardiovascular time series with an adaptive slope multilayer perceptron neural network","volume":"46","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6435191","pubMedId":"10612902","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Forecasting chaotic cardiovascular time series with an adaptive slope multilayer perceptron neural network","sourcePdf":"00804572.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032761S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"27","articleId":"804572","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":804574,"authors":[{"name":"E.M.

This configuration has some interesting properties, which provide an extended bandwidth for high-frequency EMI rejection (such as fluorescent lights interference). The improvement is around 20 dB for frequencies of few kilohertz and the circuit is easy to compensate for stability.

Either a bipolar or a tetrapolar technique can be applied, requiring about 1/spl times/10/sup 3/ to 3/spl times/10/sup 7/ cells/ml to produce detectable changes in the impedance curves. Theoretical analysis of the electrode-electrolyte interface during bacterial growth is lacking, with no generally accepted measuring standards. Besides, there is considerable disagreement. The authors separated out the interface and medium components using the frequency variation technique (FVT) and also analyzed the interface reactance-resistance diagram, both before and after bacterial growth. Medium resistance R/sub m/, interface reactance X/sub i/, and interface resistance R/sub i/, were quantified as time functions growth curves, from the complex bipolar impedance seen between two electrodes. The authors took into account the electrical current density, the temperature and the associated circuitry, also explaining the theoretical and experimental bases that justify the proposed dissecting procedure. It was found that, within the working frequency range, R/sub m/, R/sub i/, and X/sub i/ percental growth curves are frequency-independent, i.e., neither R/sub m/(J), nor N/sub i/(f) nor R/sub i/(f) changed their slopes before, during and after bacterial growth. Besides, no /spl alpha/-dispersion effect in R/sub m/ curves was detected. It is concluded that impedance microbiology could become a fertile area for interdisciplinary knowledge; its development might offer new avenues for basic and applied research.","doi":"10.1109/10.804577","startPage":"1483","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/17446/00804577.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.804577","endPage":"1487","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Medium and interface components in impedance microbiology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/804577/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Medium and interface components in impedance microbiology","volume":"46","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6435196","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","pubMedId":"10612907","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Medium and interface components in impedance microbiology","sourcePdf":"00804577.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036806S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"35","articleId":"804577","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":804627,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In recent years, a pursued goal has been the identification of defects for diagnostic purposes. This could be done through the analysis of a set of PD data and then using neural networks. In this paper a novel defect identification method is presented. Starting from PD data detected on a large family of specimens, the method aims at the evaluation of a suitable set of parameters to be used as input variables of a small neural network, able to identify the probable defect inside the insulation. With this aim the statistical Weibull analysis is performed on PD pulse amplitude histograms to obtain the scale parameter /spl alpha/ and the shape parameter /spl beta/. Then, two fractal parameters (fractal dimension and lacunarity) and two statistical operators (Skewness and Kurtosis) are evaluated from the PD phase histogram and from the 3-dimension histogram respectively. Tests of the above method performed either on samples containing artificial defects built in the laboratory or on natural defects in HV components are then reported. Comments are consequently put forward.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/804627/","accessionNumber":"6536660","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-20 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel method for the recognition of PD patterns by neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel method for the recognition of PD patterns by neural network","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00804627.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02741S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17424","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6531","citationCount":"3","articleId":"804627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":804640,"authors":[{"name":"Xianhe Jur","affiliation":["Dept. of Electr.

Eleven well-designed discharge models are presented as well. According to results of PD measurements and neural network (NN) training and testing, two different NN paradigms can recognize different PD sources for those data at the same voltage level.

A decision-feedback equalizer is designed which relies on an adaptive channel estimator to compute its parameters. The channel estimate is reduced in size by selecting only the significant components, whose delay span is often much shorter than the multipath spread of the channel. This estimate is used to cancel the post-cursor ISI prior to linear equalization. Optimal coefficient selection (sparsing) is performed by truncation in magnitude. The advantages of this approach are reduction in the number of receiver parameters, optimal implementation of sparse feedback, and efficient parallel implementation of adaptive algorithms for the multichannel pre-combiner, the fractionally-spaced channel estimators and the short feedforward equalizer alters. The receiver algorithm is demonstrated using real data transmitted at 10 kbps over 3 km in shallow water.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1999.804768","publicationTitle":"Oceans '99. MTS/IEEE.

One of the important advantages of vertical MOS transistor technology is that the channel length scaling is not limited by the minimum lithographic resolution. The vertical MOS transistor, by virtue of increased W and smaller L, allowed the utilization of the side-walls of a 3D trench to form the transistor channel. The device will have much higher drain current and operating frequency than a planar MOS transistor patterned in the same planar surface area. Conventional processes such as ion implantation cannot be used to control the threshold voltage (V/sub t/) of a vertical MOS transistor.

Although the concept of redundancy repair is relatively simple, i.e. replacement of faulty cells within a memory array with functional substitutes, the process can be relatively complex. Traditional redundancy repair techniques physically remove the defective cells from the operational circuit by \"fusing\" predetermined links. The \"fusing\" process actually removes a portion of the circuit referred to as a link, thereby redefining the address of a defective bit and pointing it to a working bit in the redundant array. In the past, laser fusing was performed on polysilicon materials, primarily gate structures, located in the support area of a memory chip. However, recent developments in back-end processes and the push for cost reduction in DRAM fabrication have motivated us to implement fuses on back-end metal wiring levels. As this migration introduced material and process changes, a qualification plan was instituted to determine the robustness of this new process. This paper examines the reasons to migrate the links to metal levels and outlines the work that was done to qualify this new technology. Fusing characteristics of metal versus polysilicon links are discussed and the effects of fusing variables are described. Finally, data is presented to show that DRAM metal fuses are reliable in large scale manufacturing environments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuses","Redundancy","Manufacturing","Optical materials","Random access memory","Circuit faults","Laser theory","Costs","Optical device fabrication","Wiring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit yield","laser materials processing","electric fuses","maintenance engineering","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit metallisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability","laser activated metal fuses","DRAMs","redundancy activation","manufacturing yield","redundancy repair","faulty cell replacement","memory array","functional substitutes","redundancy repair techniques","defective cells","operational circuit","fusing process","defective bit address","working bit address","laser fusing","polysilicon materials","gate structures","memory chip support area","back-end processes","cost reduction","DRAM fabrication","fuses","back-end metal wiring levels","qualification plan","metal links","polysilicon links","fusing variables","DRAM metal fuses","large scale manufacturing environments"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=804850","doi":"10.1109/IEMT.1999.804850","startPage":"389","endPage":"394","publicationTitle":"Twenty Fourth IEEE/CPMT International Electronics Manufacturing Technology Symposium (Cat.

Measurements from chemical processes are typically available at different sampling rates. For example, composition estimates in a distillation column are available at a much slower rate than flow, temperature and pressure measurements. Multirate systems pose a challenging problem due to several reasons such as increased complexity design, time-varying nature, etc. Systems consisting of fast-rate control moves and slow-sampled outputs are a common scenario in chemical processes and of practical interest. Traditionally, inferential techniques based on secondary measurements have been used to design the fast-rate input moves. Lifting techniques conveniently transform multirate systems to single-rate lifted systems with increased dimensionality. Controllers designed using lifting techniques require that certain causality constraints are satisfied. We show firstly, that intersample ripples can arise in the closed-loop output of a multirate system as a result of non-uniform gains of the discrete lifted system and inverse lifting. Secondly, we present conditions on the controller gains to avoid intersample ripples.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17442","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1999.804949","publicationTitle":"Engineering Solutions for the Next Millennium. 1999 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (Cat.

It is the intent of this paper to discuss the application of the method to a bent line array where the weights are chosen to offer both array shading and bend compensation. It will be demonstrated that for reasonable amounts of array curvature the IBF has a beampattern close to the benchmark delay-and-sum beamformer and a rule-of-thumb is given for the number of weights necessary for Kaiser-Bessel shading of a uniform line-array bent into a circular arc of known radius.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1999.804995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17369","startPage":"910","endPage":"915 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Oceans '99.

A fundamental limitation of the conventional beamformer is that the angular resolution depends upon the size of the receive-array. The use of subarray interferometry may increase the mapping resolution for oblique beams, but this method is not valid in the case of multiple scatterers. Therefore, it is interesting to examine how modern high-resolution beamformers work for multibeam echo sounders. Early research for this purpose, based on data simulation, showed promising results. The authors apply high-resolution beamformers to raw sonar data recorded at the receiver elements of Simrad EM3000 multibeam echo sounders. The estimation of spatial covariances plays an important role in high-resolution beamforming. A method to improve the estimation by subtracting noise covariances is applied. Among several beamformers they tested, MUSIC and ESPRIT gave the best results. Compared to the Fourier transform beamformer, high-resolution beamformers clearly improved the resolution. However, the noise level might also increase. It seems that a combined use of conventional and high-resolution beamforming may improve the sonar performance.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1999.804997","displayPublicationTitle":"Oceans '99. MTS/IEEE.

We show evidence (both visual and mathematical) that I/O accesses are consistent with self-similarity. For this analysis, we have used two sets of disk activity traces collected from various systems over different periods of time. In addition to studying the aggregated I/O workload that is directed to the storage system, we perform a structural modeling of the workload in order to understand the underlying causes that produce the observed self-similarity. This structural modeling shows that self-similar behavior can be explained by combining two different approaches: the on/off source model and Cox's model. The former applies to those processes that remain active during the whole trace, while the latter applies to sources that show a very short activity time.","doi":"10.1109/MASCOT.1999.805060","publicationTitle":"MASCOTS '99.

The main applications of the architecture are public key systems which are based on the discrete logarithm problem for elliptic curves. The architectures use a representation of the field GF(2/sup k/) as GF((2/sup n/)/sup m/), where k=n/spl middot/m. The approach explores bit parallel arithmetic in the subfield GF(2/sup n/) and serial processing for the extension field arithmetic. This mixed parallel-serial (hybrid) approach can lead to fast implementations. As the core module, a hybrid multiplier is introduced and several optimizations are discussed. We provide two different approaches to squaring. We develop exact expressions for the complexity of parallel squarers in composite fields, which can have a surprisingly low complexity. The hybrid architectures are capable of exploring the time-space trade-off paradigm in a flexible manner. In particular, the number of clock cycles for one field multiplication, which is the atomic operation in most public key schemes, can be reduced by a factor of n compared to other known realizations. The acceleration is achieved at the cost of an increased computational complexity.

We describe the error detection as part of the overall LOP, perform estimates of its delay and complexity, and compare with previous schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leading-one prediction with concurrent position correction","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.805157","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/17451/00805157.pdf","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.805157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=805157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Leading-one prediction with concurrent position correction","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6418639","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leading-one prediction with concurrent position correction","sourcePdf":"00805157.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034113S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"63","articleId":"805157","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":805158,"authors":[{"name":"V.S.

In this work, we propose a representation of test patterns for genetic optimization based test generation, where subsets of inputs are considered as indivisible entities. Using this representation, crossover between two test patterns t/sub 1/ and t/sub 2/ copies all the values of each subset either from t/sub 1/ or from t/sub 2/. By keeping input subsets undivided, activation and propagation capabilities of t/sub 1/ and t/sub 2/ are expected to be captured and carried over to the new test patterns.

By operating directly on binary code without any assumption on the availability of source code, our approach is realistic and appropriate for the analysis of COTS software products. To be able to reason on such low-level code, we need a suite of program transformations that aim to get a high level imperative representation of the code. The intention is to significantly improve the analysability while preserving the original semantics. Next we apply slicing techniques to extract those code fragments that are critical from the security standpoint. Finally, these fragments are subjected to verification against behavioral specifications to statically decide whether they exhibit malicious behaviors or not.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-18 June 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6423069","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Static analysis of binary code to isolate malicious behaviors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Static analysis of binary code to isolate malicious behaviors","confLoc":"Stanford, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00805197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061487S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17409","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6520","citationCount":"26","articleId":"805197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":805229,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In gain mode the Swt-LNA operates on a single 3V supply and the current (thus output IP3) can be adjusted from 5 to 60 mA (input IP3=+1 to +15 dBm). The Swt-LNA provides a typical 1.4 dB noise figure and 14 dB gain. When the current control pin sets the LNA to 0 mA, the Swt-LNA goes automatically into bypass mode. Bypass mode has typically 2 dB loss and +35 dBm IIP3. The IC is packaged in a low cost 2 mm sq. SOT-343 plastic package. This Swt-LNA provides smaller size, lower NF, wider bandwidth, and easier usage than previously reported, similar products.","doi":"10.1109/RFIC.1999.805250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIC.1999.805250","startPage":"109","endPage":"112","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium (Cat No.99CH37001)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6527/17420/00805250.pdf","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium (Cat No.99CH37001)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A miniature PHEMT switched-LNA for 800 MHz to 8.0 GHz handset applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"A miniature PHEMT switched-LNA for 800 MHz to 8.0 GHz handset applications","conferenceDate":"14-15 June 1999","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6409881","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805250/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A miniature PHEMT switched-LNA for 800 MHz to 8.0 GHz handset applications","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00805250.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.137115S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6527","citationCount":"11","articleId":"805250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":805253,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Operating at an accelerated DC bias condition of Vds=5.2 V and Ids=250 mA/mm, two-stage balanced amplifiers were lifetested at three-temperatures (T/sub ambient/=235/spl deg/C, T/sub ambient/=250/spl deg/C, and T/sub ambient/=265/spl deg/C) in air ambient. Failure time for each temperature was determined using /spl Delta/S21=-1.0 dB measured at room temperature as the failure criteria. The activation energy (Ea) is 1.6 eV, achieving a projected median-time-to-failure (MTF) of 7/spl times/10/sup 9/ hours at a 125/spl deg/C junction temperature. This is the first report of 0.15 /spl mu/m HEMT reliability based on S21 failure criteria of MMIC amplifiers under DC stress at high junction temperature in air ambient. This result demonstrates a robust HEMT technology immune to the stress effects of high electric field under high temperature operation suitable for non-hermetic commercial Ka-band applications.","doi":"10.1109/RFIC.1999.805259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RFIC.1999.805259","startPage":"153","endPage":"156","displayPublicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium (Cat No.99CH37001)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6527/17420/00805259.pdf","publicationTitle":"1999 IEEE Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits Symposium (Cat No.99CH37001)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High reliability non-hermetic 0.15 /spl mu/m GaAs pseudomorphic HEMT MMIC amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","displayDocTitle":"High reliability non-hermetic 0.15 /spl mu/m GaAs pseudomorphic HEMT MMIC amplifiers","conferenceDate":"14-15 June 1999","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6409891","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805259/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High reliability non-hermetic 0.15 /spl mu/m GaAs pseudomorphic HEMT MMIC amplifiers","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00805259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055884S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6527","citationCount":"9","articleId":"805259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":805265,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The reason is difficulties of evaluation by large-scale benchmarks with reproducible results. Our Bricks performance evaluation system allows the analysis and comparison of various scheduling schemes in a typical high-performance global computing setting. Bricks can simulate various behaviors of global computing systems, especially the behavior of networks and resource scheduling algorithms. Moreover, Bricks is partitioned into components such that not only can its constituents be replaced to simulate various different system algorithms, but it also allows the incorporation of existing global computing components via its foreign interface. To test the validity of the latter characteristics, we incorporated the NWS (Network Weather Service) system, which monitors and forecasts global computing systems behavior. Experiments were conducted by running NWS under a real environment versus a Bricks-simulated environment, given the observed parameters of the real environment. We observed that Bricks behaved in the same manner as the real environment, and NWS also behaved similarly, making quite comparative forecasts under both environments.","doi":"10.1109/HPDC.1999.805287","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

For example, several computers and network elements may be required in order to achieve real-time reconstruction of experimental data, while a large numerical simulation may require simultaneous access to multiple supercomputers. Motivated by these concerns, we have developed a general resource management architecture for Grid environments, in which resource co-allocation is an integral component. We examine the co-allocation problem in detail and present mechanisms that allow an application to guide resource selection during the co-allocation process; these mechanisms address issues relating to the allocation, monitoring, control, and configuration of distributed computations. We describe the implementation of co-allocators based on these mechanisms and present the results of microbenchmark studies and large-scale application experiments that provide insights into the costs and practical utility of our techniques.","doi":"10.1109/HPDC.1999.805301","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

As an application of this technology, I and a team of 30 faculty, staff, and students from Stanford University and the University of Washington spent the 1998-99 academic year digitizing the sculptures and architecture of Michelangelo. During this time, we scanned 10 statues, including the giant figure of David, and 2 building interiors, including the Medici Chapel, which was designed by Michelangelo. As a side project, we also acquired a high-resolution light field of his statue of Night, in the Medici Chapel. Finally, in another side project, we scanned the 1,163 fragments of the Forma Urbis Romae, the giant marble map of ancient Rome. In the months ahead we will process the data we have collected to create 3D digital models of these objects and, in the case of the Forma Urbis, we will try to assemble the map. The goals of this project are scholarly and educational. Commercial use of the models is not excluded, and many such uses can be imagined, but none is currently planned. I outline the technological underpinnings, logistical challenges, and possible outcomes of this project.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"8-8 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6402557","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The digital Michelangelo project","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The digital Michelangelo project","confLoc":"Ottawa, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00805329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111283S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6524","citationCount":"21","articleId":"805329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":805346,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The alignment method is efficient, and it is less likely to get stuck into a local minimum than previous methods, and can be used in conjunction with any pairwise method based on aligning overlapping surface sections.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IM.1999.805346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17414","startPage":"160","endPage":"168","displayPublicationTitle":"Second International Conference on 3-D Digital Imaging and Modeling (Cat.

The refinement is obtained through weighted least squares matching of multiple profile maps acquired from different viewpoints and registered previously using an approximate calibration. Testing with synthetically generated profile maps shows that if the geometry of the object is appropriate and the registration parameters and the intrinsic parameters of the system are known exactly, then a calibration accuracy of 0.003...0.00003% relative to the scene dimensions can be achieved as the average noise level in the maps used for the calibration decreases from 0.3 down to zero pixels. It is also possible to adjust several calibrations at the same time. The registration and calibration parameters can be refined simultaneously, but a close initial estimate and rather complex object geometry are needed for an accuracy of 0.03% when the average noise level is 0.03 pixels. Determining the corresponding points by interpolation on the parametric domains of the maps yields higher accuracy than perpendicular projection to the tangent planes at the closest points in 3D in both registration and calibration tasks. The highest accuracy is achieved when the interpolation errors are as equal as possible within the overlapping areas.","doi":"10.1109/IM.1999.805348","publicationTitle":"Second International Conference on 3-D Digital Imaging and Modeling (Cat.

This enables us to use spherical geometry to compute the location and time epoch of the observation of the closest approach of the satellite's ground trace to the terminal. This is also the epoch of the observation of the maximum elevation angle from the terminal to the satellite.

Such a configuration would have less propagation delay and be cheaper to launch than satellites at higher or geosynchronous altitude. However, many more satellites are necessary at low altitude to achieve reasonable coverage of the earth and insure availability of the resource. Further, the geometry of such a constellation would be dynamic with communication links of short duration as the satellites speed past each other or a ground site. The most difficult design issue in these systems is a stable method of routing messages that will sustain a reasonable level of traffic. This paper explores the problems of routing and switching messages through a constellation of low altitude satellites and examines some of the related demands on technology. The dynamic nature of crosslinks, uplinks, and downlinks requires a very agile antenna system, and the volume of information for routing of traffic is overwhelming. Use of some type of facetted phased array antenna is advocated to solve the former problem, but the latter problem is more subtle. Since the volume of ephemeris and constellation data as well as the rate of update is unmanageable, schemes relying on some form of broadcast or random access may be considered. It is concluded that none of the known or examined approaches to routing and switching is completely satisfactory.","doi":"10.1109/7.805452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/17457/00805452.pdf","startPage":"1362","endPage":"1368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.805452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overview of multiple satellite communication networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=805452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805452/","displayDocTitle":"Overview of multiple satellite communication networks","volume":"35","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6418695","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of multiple satellite communication networks","sourcePdf":"00805452.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019021S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"4","articleId":"805452","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":805454,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Some of the particles may be trapped within the materials of the spacecraft. Recent data indicates that an S-band phased-array antenna on a spacecraft may experience electrostatic discharges from such ion deposition at the elements of the array. These discharges may induce RF interference of sufficient magnitude to degrade transponder performance. This issue is addressed by considering the degradation to a binary phase shift keying (BPSK) signal. A simple model for the electrostatic phenomenon is described, and error probabilities are evaluated.

One can easily show that under the assumption of uncorrelated inputs and known correlation matrices that the dual channel matched filter system is equivalent to a single channel matched filter designed to process both input signals. We also show that when estimated correlation matrices are used in place of the true correlation matrices the dual channel matched filter system achieves nearly the same normalized SINR performance as the single channel matched filter system with half the secondary data. The results suggest that, with the proper preprocessing to decorrelate the input signal, a single channel matched filter system can be replaced by a dual channel matched filter system of smaller size, leading to a reduction in the secondary data requirements and potentially, to a reduction in the computational cost.","doi":"10.1109/7.805459","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","startPage":"1429","endPage":"1438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.805459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17457","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/17457/00805459.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Signal to noise ratio","Signal analysis","Performance analysis","Interference","Random variables","Taylor series","Process design","Signal design","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","matched filters","filtering theory","correlation methods","white noise","Toeplitz matrices","covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual channel matched filter system","signal-to-interference plus noise ratio","performance analysis","normalized SINR","random variables","known distributions","Taylor series expansion","approximate expressions","uncorrelated inputs","correlation matrices","single channel matched filter equivalence","reduced secondary data requirements","reduced computational cost","optimal signal detection","covariance matrix","Monte Carlo simulation","white noise","Toeplitz matrices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance of a dual channel matched filter system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805459/","volume":"35","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6418702","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of a dual channel matched filter system","sourcePdf":"00805459.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036482S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"2","articleId":"805459","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":805460,"authors":[{"name":"T.L.

Design of efficient routing protocols in such networks is a challenging issue. A class of routing protocols called on-demand protocols has recently attracted attention because of their low routing overhead. The on-demand protocols depend on query floods to discover routes whenever a new route is needed. Such floods take up a substantial portion of network bandwidth. We focus on a particular on-demand protocol, called dynamic source routing, and show how intelligent use of multipath techniques can reduce the frequency of query floods. We develop an analytic modeling framework to determine the relative frequency of query floods for various techniques. Results show that while multipath routing is significantly better than single path routing, the performance advantage is small beyond a few paths and for long path lengths. It also shows that providing all intermediate nodes in the primary (shortest) route with alternative paths has a significantly better performance than providing only the source with alternate paths.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6497909","displayDocTitle":"On-demand multipath routing for mobile ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-demand multipath routing for mobile ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00805497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035225S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17441","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6535","citationCount":"187","articleId":"805497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":805525,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An adaptive monitoring scheme that is based on an estimation algorithm and driven by a measurement of the interference and predicted traffic parameters of the admitted connections is established. The dynamic control that we propose at the user network interface, UNI, provides information about the instantaneous bit rate of a source allowing more effective flow control and achieves a good match in terms of predicting the congestion of any switch. It is able to police implicit resource management, which is used for both continuous bit rate (CBR) and variable bit rate (VBR) traffics as well as explicit resource management that is used for available bit rate (ABR) traffics.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Eight International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (Cat.

Each router maintains entries only for those destinations for which data flows through the router which reduces storage space requirements and the amount of bandwidth needed to maintain correct routing tables. In ROAM, routes are established and maintained on demand using diffusing computations. A router does not send updates for active destinations, unless its distance to them increases beyond a given threshold. ROAM maintains a state that informs routers when a destination is unreachable and prevents routers from sending unnecessary search packets attempting to find paths to an unreachable destination. ROAM is shown to converge in a finite time after an arbitrary sequence of topological changes and is shown to be loop-free at every instant.

The effectiveness of our I/sub DDT/ test method is compared with I/sub DDQ/ as well as with SA-based voltage testing for devices produced in 0.25 /spl mu/m technology. For these devices a large vector-to-vector spread in I/sub DDT/ is observed. This spread is investigated together with the die-to-die spread to determine a pass/fail criterion. The vector-to-vector spread is compensated by comparing the measured I/sub DDT/ values with those of a known good (golden) device. A hardware solution for an I/sub DDT/ monitor is presented which includes a correction for the golden device signature. Therefore real-time I/sub DDT/ testing on a digital tester without data-processing becomes feasible.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Test Conference 1999. Proceedings (IEEE Cat.

These multi-clock designs, ranging in size from 200 K to 800 K gates, pose significant challenges to logic BIST methodology, flow, and tools. The paper presents the process of generating a BIST-compliant core along with the logic BIST controller for at-speed testing. Comparative data on fault grades and area overhead between automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) and logic BIST are reported. The experimental results demonstrate that with automation of the proposed solutions, logic BIST can achieve test quality approaching that of ATPG with minimal area overhead and few changes to the design flow.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805650/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6536386","conferenceDate":"30-30 Sept. 1999","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Logic BIST for large industrial designs: real issues and case studies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logic BIST for large industrial designs: real issues and case studies","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00805650.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028141S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6540","citationCount":"192","articleId":"805650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":805748,"authors":[{"name":"Min Xu","affiliation":["Y Explorations, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Min Xu","id":"37344817200"},{"name":"F.J.

Much of the previous work has focused on estimation techniques that use very simple cost models based solely on the gate and/or literal count. Those models are not accurate enough to allow effective design space exploration since the effects of interconnect can indeed dominate the final design cost. The situation becomes even worse when the design is targeted to field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technologies since the wire delay may contribute up to 60% of the overall design delay. In this paper, we present an approach of estimating area and timing for lookup-table-based FPGAs that takes into account not only gate area and delay, but also the wiring effects. We select the Xilinx XC4000 series as our main concentration because of their popularity. We tested our estimator with several benchmarks and the results show that we receive accurate area and timing estimates efficiently.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/17460/00805748.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"418","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/92.805748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.805748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17460","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=805748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate prediction of quality metrics for logic level designs targeted toward lookup-table-based FPGAs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic design","Space technology","Timing","High level synthesis","Field programmable gate arrays","Costs","Delay estimation","Space exploration","Wire","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","high level synthesis","logic partitioning","timing","table lookup","minimisation of switching nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lookup-table-based FPGA","logic level designs","quality metrics","accurate prediction","high-level synthesis","technology-specific tools","design space","wire delay","timing estimation","area estimation","Xilinx XC4000 series","technology mapping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Accurate prediction of quality metrics for logic level designs targeted toward lookup-table-based FPGAs","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6449299","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate prediction of quality metrics for logic level designs targeted toward lookup-table-based FPGAs","sourcePdf":"00805748.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053352S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"9","articleId":"805748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":805750,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The importance and the effect of SBO is shown on realistic examples both in the video and asynchronous transfer-mode (ATM) domains. We show that it is important to take into account which data is being accessed in parallel, instead of only considering the number of simultaneous memory accesses.

This solution is based on the alpha power law for deep submicrometer technologies. Two figures of merit are presented that are useful for determining if a section of interconnect should be modeled as either an RLC or an RC impedance. The damping factor of a lumped RLC circuit is shown to be a useful criterion. The second useful figure of merit considered in this paper is the ratio of the rise time of the input signal at the driver of an interconnect line to the time of flight of the signals across the line. AS/X circuit simulations of an RLC transmission line and a five section RC II circuit based on a 0.25-/spl mu/m IBM CMOS technology are used to quantify and determine the relative accuracy of an RC model. One primary result of this paper is evidence demonstrating that a range for the length of the interconnect exists for which inductance effects are prominent. Furthermore, it is shown that under certain conditions, inductance effects are negligible despite the length of the section of interconnect.","doi":"10.1109/92.805751","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/17460/00805751.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.805751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Figures of merit to characterize the importance of on-chip inductance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805751/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Figures of merit to characterize the importance of on-chip inductance","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6449302","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Figures of merit to characterize the importance of on-chip inductance","sourcePdf":"00805751.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050699S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"140","articleId":"805751","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":805752,"authors":[{"name":"K.K.

These architectures not only require the fewest number of multiplexers, but also consume the least energy for a specified latency. These architectures are based on a carry-select configuration where each block can be a carry-select or tree or modified-tree block. The modified-tree blocks permit ripple in the carry-generation process; which leads to dramatic reduction in the number of multiplexers as well as power consumption. It is shown that, for a block length W, the carry-select block and the modified-tree block with internal ripple of (log/sub 2/ W-1) multiplexer stages require the same number of multiplexers. This is a powerful result because the longer carry-select blocks can be replaced by the modified-tree blocks without increasing the multiplexer complexity. The advantage of this approach is in reduction of power consumption since the amount of ripple in the carry-select block grows linearly with W, while that in the modified-tree block grows logarithmically with W. It is shown that for fastest adder/subtractor designs, the proposed CSMT architecture can reduce the multiplexer complexity by about 40% for word-lengths ranging from 8 to 32, when compared with known tree approaches. It is shown that, for a certain specified latency and specified number of multiplexers, a family of carry-select and CSMT adders can be designed. It is shown that, for a specified latency, the carry-select adders with larger number of blocks and smaller block lengths consume less power. Through extensive simulations, CSMT adder configurations that minimize energy consumption or power-latency product, which are approximately 5% to 10% less than those of known tree and best carry-select adders, are obtained. Finally, based on novel latency-matching and block-increment techniques introduced in this paper, a systematic design methodology for design of CSMT adders with least latency, least number of multiplexers, and least energy consumption is presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiplexing","Energy consumption","Arithmetic","Hybrid power systems","Design methodology","Added delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","carry logic","pipeline arithmetic","multiplexing equipment","low-power electronics","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid carry-select modified-tree adder","binary carry generators","adders using multiplexers","low-energy","tree block","modified-tree block","carry-select block","internal ripple","multiplexer complexity","adder/subtractor designs","power-latency product","latency-matching","block-increment techniques","systematic design methodology","redundant arithmetic","8 to 32 bit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=805752","doi":"10.1109/92.805752","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/17460/00805752.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.805752","startPage":"450","endPage":"462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-energy CSMT carry generators and binary adders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-energy CSMT carry generators and binary adders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6449303","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-energy CSMT carry generators and binary adders","sourcePdf":"00805752.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058978S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"21","articleId":"805752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":805755,"authors":[{"name":"K.Y.

In this scheme, communication between every pair of modules is done through an asynchronous first-in first-out (FIFO) channel; communication between a module and the FIFO is done using a request/acknowledge handshaking. Synchronization of handshake signals to the local module clock is done in an unconventional way-the local clock built out of a ring oscillator is paused or stretched, if necessary, to ensure that the handshake signal satisfies setup and hold time constraints with respect to the local clock. In order to validate this scheme, we implemented a test chip in 0.5-/spl mu/m CMOS. This chip is designed as a ring, composed of two synchronous modules, an asynchronous module, and two asynchronous FIFOs. Each module functions as a receiver to one module and a sender to another module. Test results show that the chip functions reliably up to 456 MHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/17460/00805755.pdf","startPage":"482","endPage":"488","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/92.805755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.805755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17460","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=805755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pausible clocking-based heterogeneous systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Timing","Pipeline processing","Very large scale integration","Propagation delay","Throughput","Design automation","Shape","Capacitance","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronisation","clocks","CMOS digital integrated circuits","VLSI","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pausible clocking","heterogeneous systems","synchronization failures","asynchronous first-in first-out channel","request/acknowledge handshaking","handshake signal","setup time","hold time","CMOS","0.5 micron","456 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Pausible clocking-based heterogeneous systems","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6449306","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pausible clocking-based heterogeneous systems","sourcePdf":"00805755.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044527S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"58","articleId":"805755","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":805757,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Experimental results from the application of the proposed techniques on several signal-processing algorithms have proven that significant switching activity savings can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/92.805757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/17460/00805757.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/92.805757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17460","startPage":"492","endPage":"497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel techniques for bus power consumption reduction in realizations of sum-of-product computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=805757","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel techniques for bus power consumption reduction in realizations of sum-of-product computation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805757/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6449308","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel techniques for bus power consumption reduction in realizations of sum-of-product computation","sourcePdf":"00805757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035073S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"6","articleId":"805757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":805765,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The output logic and the next-state logic of the finite state machines are checked independently. By checking parity on the present state instead of the next state, this technique allows detection of errors in bistable elements (that were hitherto not detected by many previous techniques) while requiring no changes in the original machine specifications. This paper also examines design choices with respect to parity prediction circuits. Two such examined choices are the multi-parity-group and the single-parity-group techniques. A new state encoding technique based on the JEDI program is developed for the synthesis of the next-state logic with an additional parity output. Synthesis results produced by our proposed procedure for the MCNC'89 FSM benchmark circuits show on average a 25% reduction in literal counts compared to previous techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Test Conference 1999.

Our method achieves optimal solutions for most circuits in hardware overhead, but it takes a long processing time. In this paper, we present a heuristic method to address this problem. The heuristic partitions a given data flow graph into smaller regions based on control steps and applies the ILP for each region successively. Our heuristic reduces the processing time by several orders of magnitude, while the quality of the solution is slightly compromised.

The entire chip is eventually tested by having (STARs) gradually rove across the FPGA. Our approach guarantees complete testing of programmable logic blocks and interconnect, and provides maximum diagnostic resolution. A new fault-tolerant (FT) technique allows using partially defective FPGA resources for normal operation, providing longer mission life-span in the presence of faults.

The results show that stress combinations influence the coverage of the test algorithms for these SRAMs, and that the influence is less for these SRAMs than for DRAMs. Selecting the right stress combination allows for using a simpler algorithm. The simple memory test primitives can detect all faults given the proper stresses. Power supply voltage turns out to be a very important non-algorithmic stress.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805831/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6543617","conferenceDate":"30-30 Sept. 1999","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Industrial evaluation of stress combinations for march tests applied to SRAMs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Industrial evaluation of stress combinations for march tests applied to SRAMs","confLoc":"Atlantic City, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"00805831.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04314S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6540","citationCount":"22","articleId":"805831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":805891,"authors":[{"name":"J.-P.

The effects of transverse terrain gradients, propagation around the sides of obstacles, and scattering from large obstacles to the side of the great circle path are not modeled, leading to prediction errors in many situations. In this paper, these errors are addressed by extending the 2-D PE to three dimensions. This changes the matrix form of the PE making it difficult to solve. A novel iterative solver technique, which is highly efficient and guaranteed to converge, is presented. In order to confine the domain of computation, a three-dimensional (3-D) rectangular box is placed around the region of interest. A new second-order nonreflecting boundary condition is imposed on the surface of this box and its angular validity is established. The boundary condition is shown to keep unwanted fictitious reflections to an acceptable level in the domain of interest. The terrain boundary conditions for this 3-D PE method are developed and an original technique for incorporating them into the matrix form of the iterative solver is described. This is done using the concept of virtual field points below the ground. The prediction accuracy of the 3-D PE in comparison to the 2-D PE is tested both against indoor scaled frequency measurements and very high frequency (VHF) field trials.","doi":"10.1109/8.805904","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/17461/00805904.pdf","startPage":"1586","endPage":"1596","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.805904","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17461","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A three-dimensional parabolic equation applied to VHF/UHF propagation over irregular terrain","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"A three-dimensional parabolic equation applied to VHF/UHF propagation over irregular terrain","volume":"47","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6435178","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A three-dimensional parabolic equation applied to VHF/UHF propagation over irregular terrain","sourcePdf":"00805904.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024653S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"41","articleId":"805904","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":805906,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Integral to efficient GA/MoM integration is the use of direct Z-matrix manipulation (DMM). In DMM a \"mother\" structure is selected and its corresponding impedance or Z-matrix is filled only once prior to beginning the GA optimization process. The GA optimizer then optimizes the design by creating substructures of the mother structure as represented by the corresponding subsets of the original mother Z-matrix. Application of DMM with GA/MoM significantly reduces the total optimization time by eliminating multiple Z-matrix fill operations. DMM also facilitates the use of matrix partitioning and presolving to further reduce the optimization time in many practical cases. The design of a broad-band patch antenna with greater than 20% bandwidth and a dual-band patch antenna are presented as examples of the utility of GA/MoM with DMM. Measured results for the dual-band antenna are compared to numerical results. Excellent agreement between numerical and measured results is observed.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/17461/00805906.pdf","startPage":"1606","endPage":"1614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms and method of moments (GA/MOM) for the design of integrated antennas","doi":"10.1109/8.805906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.805906","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=805906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/805906/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms and method of moments (GA/MOM) for the design of integrated antennas","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","accessionNumber":"6435180","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"47","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms and method of moments (GA/MOM) for the design of integrated antennas","sourcePdf":"00805906.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049156S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17461","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"144","articleId":"805906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":805922,"authors":[{"name":"A.E.

On the motor side, the three-level voltage source inverter, also known as the neutral-point clamped (NPC) inverter, is the preferred type. In combination with the newest snubberless IGCT (integrated gate-commutated thyristor) technology, it is possible to build MV inverters without series connection up to 4 kV line-to-line voltage and higher. This results in a highly efficient and reliable MV power converter system with a minimum parts count. By using an LC-filter between the inverter and motor terminals, feeding of standard motors without derating becomes possible. With the use of direct torque control (DTC), as developed for low voltage drives, the MV drives applications benefit from the synergies with low voltage drives. Specific add-ons for the NPC inverter and the lossless resonance control of the LC-filter are needed. The DTC and the IGCT have been in commercial operation for several years, showing their expected very high levels of reliability and robustness.

Various topologies and modulation strategies have been investigated for utility and drive applications in literature. Trends in power semiconductor technology indicate a trade-off in the selection of power devices in terms of switching frequency and voltage sustaining capability. New power converter topologies permit modular realization of multilevel inverters using a hybrid approach involving integrated gate commutated thyristors (IGCT) and insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) operating in synergism. This paper is devoted to the investigation of a hybrid multilevel power conversion system typically suitable for high performance, high power applications. This system designed for 4.16 kV, /spl ges/100 hp load comprises of a hybrid seven-level inverter, a diode bridge rectifier and an IGBT rectifier per phase. The IGBT rectifier is used on the utility side as a real power flow regulator to the low voltage converter and as a harmonic compensator for the high voltage converter. The hybrid seven-level inverter on the load side consists of a high voltage, slow switching IGCT inverter and a low voltage, fast switching IGBT inverter. By employing different devices under different operating conditions, it is shown that one can optimize the power conversion capability of entire system. A detailed analysis of a novel hybrid modulation technique for the inverter, which incorporates stepped synthesis in conjunction with variable pulse width of the consecutive steps is included. In addition, performance of a multilevel current regulated delta modulator as applied to the single phase full bridge IGBT rectifier is discussed. Detailed computer simulations accompanied with experimental verification are presented in the paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1999 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.

Negative sequence currents arising from supply unbalance are calculated using the reactive component of motor negative sequence impedance, which is essentially independent of temperature. The effects of variation in load, supply voltage, and supply voltage unbalance, have been eliminated by using a recursive least squares method to characterize the associated variation in motor reactance and residual negative sequence current in the healthy motor. Compensation is also applied for nonsimultaneous current sampling of motor fault current. Negative sequence fault currents as low as 0.1 percent of full load current can be detected in the presence of normal variations in load, voltage, and unbalance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stators","Fault diagnosis","Induction motors","Voltage","Fault currents","Phase detection","Current supplies","Impedance","Temperature","Least squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","stators","fault diagnosis","machine theory","machine testing","recursive estimation","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motors","stator fault diagnosis","power decomposition technique","positive sequence components","negative sequence components","supply unbalance","negative sequence impedance","recursive least squares method","motor reactance","residual negative sequence current","motor fault current"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IAS.1999.805999","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1999 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.

The resulting IPM machine operation as a generator in combination with an uncontrolled rectifier must be properly understood and accounted for in the machine design to avoid damage to either the machine or inverter. An approximate closed-form solution is derived in this paper which relates the resulting machine phase current (and torque) to the IPM machine parameters, the DC-link voltage and the rotor speed. The resulting operating characteristics are particularly interesting for IPM machines that have been designed with inductance saliency ratios greater than 2 (i.e., high-saliency machines). The validity of the approximate solution is confirmed using dynamic simulation results, and the implications of these results for the machine designer seeking to minimize or eliminate the impact of this undesired operating mode are thoroughly discussed.","doi":"10.1109/28.806049","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/17470/00806049.pdf","startPage":"1347","endPage":"1357","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.806049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncontrolled generator operation of interior PM synchronous machines following high-speed inverter shutdown","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806049/","displayDocTitle":"Uncontrolled generator operation of interior PM synchronous machines following high-speed inverter shutdown","volume":"35","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6446026","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncontrolled generator operation of interior PM synchronous machines following high-speed inverter shutdown","sourcePdf":"00806049.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038395S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1999","isNumber":"17470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"100","articleId":"806049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":806050,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It is actually impossible to raise the inverter switching frequency in the conventional system, although the hysteresis bandwidths for the stator flux and torque control are sufficiently diminished, because of the delay in estimating the flux and the torque. In order to overcome the problem, the proposed method introduces a dithering technique into the conventional system by superposing triangular waves with high frequency and minute amplitude on the flux error and the torque error, respectively. According to the simulation and experimental results, the stator flux ripple and the torque ripple were suppressed to approximately 30% compared with those of the conventional system. Also, the acoustic noise level of the motor was reduced to less than 56 dB over the whole speed range from 100 to 1500 r/min.","doi":"10.1109/28.806050","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.806050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17470","startPage":"1358","endPage":"1366","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/17470/00806050.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806050","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switching frequency","Inverters","Hysteresis motors","Stators","Delay estimation","Induction motor drives","Induction motors","Bandwidth","Torque control","Frequency estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","machine control","torque control","machine theory","invertors","DC-AC power convertors","switching circuits","machine testing","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct torque-controlled inverter","switching frequency enlargement","induction motor drive","inverter switching frequency","dithering technique","stator flux ripple","torque ripple","acoustic noise level"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Enlarging switching frequency in direct torque-controlled inverter by means of dithering","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6446027","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806050/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enlarging switching frequency in direct torque-controlled inverter by means of dithering","sourcePdf":"00806050.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026836S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1999","isNumber":"17470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"69","articleId":"806050","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":806054,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Ik Ha","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jung-Ik Ha","id":"37277115100"},{"name":"Seog-Joo Kang","affiliation":["Building Systems Research Laboratory, LG Industrial Systems Company Limited, Incheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seog-Joo Kang","id":"37348068100"},{"name":"Seung-Ki Sul","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Ki Sul","id":"37267508300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-9994"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9367"}],"articleNumber":"806054","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":84,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":993},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806054","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reluctance motors","Transducers","Rotors","Stators","Voltage","Synchronous motors","Sensorless control","Robustness","Magnetic confinement","Magnetic flux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reluctance motors","machine theory","control system synthesis","machine vector control","position control","velocity control","stators","rotors","closed loop systems","parameter estimation","machine testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous reluctance motor","position sensorless control scheme","high-frequency current injection method","low-speed region","flux estimation method","stator voltages","high-speed region","rotor saliency","d-axis stator current injection","closed-loop position control","closed-loop speed control","rotor angle estimation","axially-laminated reluctance motor","3.75 kW"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a position sensorless control scheme of a synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) combining a high-frequency current injection method in the low-speed region and the flux estimation method based on the stator voltages in the high-speed region.

In particular, the DC-link voltage variation under voltage sag and its dependence on source impedance, DC-link inductance and output load is computed. It is shown that, for larger source impedance, the DC-link voltage variation under a voltage sag is also large and increases the susceptibility of an ASD and may result in a nuisance trip. The results from the analysis are plotted in per-unit quantities and serve as a design guide to assess ASD performance for a variety of sags. In order to improve the performance of ASDs, this paper proposes an integrated boost converter approach. This approach provides ride-through to critical ASD load during voltage sags without any additional energy storage device. Upon detection of a voltage sag, the boost converter operates with suitable duty ratio and maintains the DC-link voltage within acceptable limits. This prevents nuisance tripping and facilitates continuous operation of critical ASD load at rated torque. The proposed integrated boost converter does not introduce any additional semiconductors in the series path of the power flow and is low in cost. A commercially available 480 V 22 kVA ASD is modified with the integrated boost converter approach, and details are discussed. Analysis, simulation, and experimental performance of the ride-through approach are presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of voltage sags on adjustable-speed drives: a critical evaluation and an approach to improve performance","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doi":"10.1109/28.806060","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/17470/00806060.pdf","startPage":"1440","endPage":"1449","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.806060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806060/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Effect of voltage sags on adjustable-speed drives: a critical evaluation and an approach to improve performance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6446037","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of voltage sags on adjustable-speed drives: a critical evaluation and an approach to improve performance","sourcePdf":"00806060.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036988S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1999","isNumber":"17470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"69","articleId":"806060","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":806066,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Two methods for solving this problem are presented. First, an unstructured nonlinear least-squares approach (NLS) is proposed. It is shown that by minimizing the NLS criterion with respect to all samples of the time-varying amplitude, the problem reduces to a two-dimensional (2-D) maximization problem. A theoretical analysis of the NLS estimator is presented, and an expression for its asymptotic variance is derived. It is shown that the NLS estimator has a variance that is very close to the Cramer-Rao bound. The second approach combines the principles behind the high-order ambiguity function (HBF) and the NLS approach. It provides a computationally simpler but suboptimum estimator. A statistical analysis of the HAF-based estimator is also carried out, and closed-form expressions are derived for the asymptotic variance of the HAF estimators based on the data and on the squared data. Numerical examples attest to the validity of the theoretical analyzes and establish a comparison between the two proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/78.806067","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17473/00806067.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.806067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17473","startPage":"3208","endPage":"3219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter estimation for random amplitude chirp signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parameter estimation for random amplitude chirp signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806067/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6448558","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter estimation for random amplitude chirp signals","sourcePdf":"00806067.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053305S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"55","articleId":"806067","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":806068,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Environments where most energy incident on the array is from scatterers local to the mobile transmitters are considered, and the effects on direction of arrival (DOA) estimation with the MUSIC algorithm are studied. Previous work has studied rapidly time-varying channels and concluded that local scattering has a minor effect on DOA estimation in such scenarios. In this work, a channel that is time-invariant during the observation period is considered, and under the assumption of small angular spread, an approximate distribution for the DOA estimates is derived. The results show that local scattering has a significant impact on DOA estimation in the time-invariant case. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the analysis and to demonstrate that the results may be used to formulate a simple estimator of angular spread. An extension to more general Rayleigh and Ricean fading channels is also included. In addition, results from processing experimental data collected in suburban environments are presented. Good agreement with the derived distributions is obtained.","doi":"10.1109/78.806068","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17473/00806068.pdf","startPage":"3220","endPage":"3234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.806068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effects of local scattering on direction of arrival estimation with MUSIC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806068","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806068/","displayDocTitle":"The effects of local scattering on direction of arrival estimation with MUSIC","volume":"47","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6448559","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of local scattering on direction of arrival estimation with MUSIC","sourcePdf":"00806068.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047165S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"127","articleId":"806068","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":806069,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The cyclic mean (CM) can be used if the multiplicative noise has nonzero mean; the cyclic variance (CV) can be used whether or not the multiplicative noise has zero mean. This paper answers the following question: under what conditions should we use the CV instead of the CM? The criteria used are the ease of detection and the accuracy of estimation. The CV is preferable to the CM if the coherent to noncoherent harmonic power ratio is less than a threshold that depends on the first four cumulants; when the noises are colored, this threshold becomes frequency dependent.

At each uniformly spaced array grid, one or more co-located and diversely oriented velocity hydrophones and/or a pressure hydrophone are placed, with the number and orientations of velocity hydrophones possibly varying from grid position to grid position in some known prearranged manner. The diverse orientation of the velocity hydrophones, however, disrupts the Vandermonde array manifold structure in each of the two uniform-linear-array legs of the L-shaped array. Nonetheless, ingenuous mathematical manipulations proposed in this paper restore the disrupted Vandermonde algebraic structure, thereby permitting once again the use of polynomial rooting to estimate the directions of arrival. A proposed pairing procedure matches each source's x-axis direction cosine estimate with its corresponding y-axis direction cosine estimate.

This information is not available in practice, and we are obliged to estimate the channel order by applying a rank detection procedure to an \"overmodeled\" data covariance matrix. Information theoretic criteria have been widely suggested approaches for this task. We check the quality of their estimates in the context of order estimation of measured microwave radio channels and confirm that they are very sensitive to variations in the SNR and the number of data samples. This fact has prohibited their successful application for channel order estimation and hits created some confusion concerning the classification into under- and over-modeled cases. Recently, it has been shown that blind channel approximation methods should attempt to model only the significant part of the channel composed of the \"large\" impulse response terms because efforts toward modeling \"small\" leading and/or trailing terms lead to effective overmodeling, which is generically ill-conditioned and, thus, should be avoided. This can be achieved by applying blind identification methods with model order equal to the order of the significant part of the true channel called the effective channel order. Toward developing an efficient approach for the detection of the effective channel order, we use numerical analysis arguments. The derived criterion provides a \"maximally stable\" decomposition of the range space of an \"overmodeled\" data covariance matrix into signal and noise subspaces. It is shown to be robust to variations in the SNR and the number of data samples. Furthermore, it provides useful effective channel order estimates, leading to sufficiently good blind approximation/equalization of measured real-world microwave radio channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind channel approximation: effective channel order determination","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.806077","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17473/00806077.pdf","startPage":"3336","endPage":"3344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.806077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17473","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806077/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Blind channel approximation: effective channel order determination","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6448568","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind channel approximation: effective channel order determination","sourcePdf":"00806077.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057417S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"114","articleId":"806077","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":806081,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Applications include cellular mobile radio, wireless local loop, and wireless local area networks. The effect of interchannel interference (ICI) arising from time-selective fading and frequency offsets and co-channel interference (CCI) is analyzed. A loop-timing method that enables a synchronous uplink between multiple mobile transceivers and a base-station is described. Adaptive antenna arrays are utilized at the base for uplink reception, and optimum array combining based on the maximum SINR criterion is used for each subchannel over slowly time-varying channels. For operation over fast time-varying channels, a novel two-stage adaptive array architecture that incorporates combined spatial diversity and constraint-based beamforming is presented. While ICI alone is most effectively overcome by spatial diversity, combined beamforming and diversity are most effective to combat CCI in the presence of fading. The overall method is suitable for real-time implementation and can be used in conjunction with traditional coding schemes to increase the link-margin.","doi":"10.1109/78.806081","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/17473/00806081.pdf","startPage":"3381","endPage":"3391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.806081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive interference suppression in multiuser wireless OFDM systems using antenna arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806081/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive interference suppression in multiuser wireless OFDM systems using antenna arrays","volume":"47","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6448571","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive interference suppression in multiuser wireless OFDM systems using antenna arrays","sourcePdf":"00806081.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062055S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17473","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","articleId":"806081","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":806084,"authors":[{"name":"Quan Pan","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Quan Pan","id":"37278540400"},{"name":"Lei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Lei Zhang","id":"37538584100"},{"name":"Guanzhong Dai","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China","Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"lastName":"Guanzhong Dai","id":"37274248600"},{"name":"Hongai Zhang","lastName":"Hongai Zhang","id":"37086967617"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"806084","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":164,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1032},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Continuous wavelet transforms","Filtration","Signal processing algorithms","Filters","Bandwidth","Frequency","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","discrete wavelet transforms","Gaussian noise","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["denoising methods","wavelet-based noise reduction methods","spatially selective noise filtration","threshold-based denoising algorithm","undecimated discrete wavelet transform","simulations","standard deviation","Gausian white noise"]}],"abstract":"To wavelet-based noise reduction methods are discussed.

The analysis of device parameter distributions reveals multiple sources of parameter correlations, some of which exhibit mutually opposing trends. We found that applying principal component analysis (PCA) to such heterogeneous statistical data may lead to confounding of data and result in underestimation of the total parameter variance. This imposes considerable constraints on the use of several methods of statistical circuit analysis based on PCA. Also the highly nonlinear relationships between the device parameters become more pronounced and cannot be approximated as linear even in the differential range. As a result, the response surface models based on the linear expansion of the performance variable around the nominal point of the device model parameters may lead to significant prediction errors. To address these difficulties, we propose a conceptually simple and accurate approach of direct sampling that treats the extracted SPICE parameter sets and their physical locations as an inseparable set and thus bypasses the dangerous stage of statistical inferences.

The models are used to perform statistical circuit simulation in order to quantitatively predict the impact of manufacturing variations on circuit performance metrics.

Foremost among the potential benefits is greatly reduced dependence on high-fidelity modeling of system dynamics. However, the methodology has only recently been proven practical by demonstration in an actual flight system. This paper begins with an overview of the design of a nonlinear adaptive control system for flight test on an unmanned helicopter test bed. Next, the design of an outer loop trajectory tracking controller as well as simulation results are presented. The paper concludes with the presentation of preliminary flight test results of the rate command system that document the actual performance of the control system in flight.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806163/","accessionNumber":"6468214","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-27 Aug. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive nonlinear controller synthesis and flight test evaluation on an unmanned helicopter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive nonlinear controller synthesis and flight test evaluation on an unmanned helicopter","confLoc":"Kohala Coast, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00806163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026218S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6503","citationCount":"40","articleId":"806163","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":806173,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We present the proof of concept and feasibility demonstration of a practical module packaging approach where free-space optical interconnects can be seamlessly integrated on electronic Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) for intra MCM interconnects. Our system level packaging architecture is based on a modified folded 4-f imaging system that has been implemented using only off-the-shelf optics, conventional electronic packaging, as well as passive alignment and assembly techniques to yield a potentially low cost manufacturable packaging solution. The prototype system, as built, supports 48 independent FSOI channels using eight separate laser and detector chips, where each chip consists of a 1D array of 12 devices. All chips are assembled on a single ceramic substrate together with three silicon chips. Parallel opto-electronic free space interconnections have been demonstrated with link speeds of up to 200 MHz per channel. The system is compact at only 10 cubic inches, and scalable as it can easily accommodate additional chips as well as two-dimensional opto-electronic device arrays for increased interconnection density.","doi":"10.1109/PI.1999.806390","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 6th International Conference on Parallel Interconnects (PI'99) (Formerly Known as MPPOI)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 6th International Conference on Parallel Interconnects (PI'99) (Formerly Known as MPPOI)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6551/17480/00806390.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PI.1999.806390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17480","startPage":"13","endPage":"20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High speed parallel multi-chip interconnection with free space optics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High speed parallel multi-chip interconnection with free space optics","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806390/","conferenceDate":"19-19 Oct. 1999","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6543922","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High speed parallel multi-chip interconnection with free space optics","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"00806390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057674S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6551","articleId":"806390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":806395,"authors":[{"name":"Ch'ng Shi Baw","affiliation":["Computer and Communications Research Center, Washington University, Saint Louis, MO, USA","University of Washington, Seattle, WA, US"],"lastName":"Ch'ng Shi Baw","id":"37337810700"},{"name":"R.D.

The next task is to verify the glue logic, which connects the IP cores to the buses. Finally, using the verified bus protocols and the IP core designs, the complete system is verified. To illustrate our methodology, we verify the PCI local bus, a widely used bus protocol in system-on-chip designs. We demonstrate various modeling and verification techniques for buses by modeling the PCI local bus with the symbolic model checker SMV.

This paper presents a novel multiplier design methodology for performing these coefficient multiplications with very low power dissipation. Given bounds on the throughput and the quantization error, our approach scales the original coefficients to enable the partitioning of each multiplication into a collection of smaller multiplications with shorter critical paths. Significant energy savings are achieved by performing these multiplications in parallel with a scaled supply voltage. Dissipation is further reduced by disabling the multiplier rows that do not affect the multiplication's outcome. We have used our methodology to design a low-power parallel multiplier for the Fast Fourier Transform. Simulation results show that our approach can result in significant power savings over conventional multipliers.","doi":"10.1109/ASIC.1999.806521","publicationTitle":"Twelfth Annual IEEE International ASIC/SOC Conference (Cat.

As opposed to the worst case fixed precision design, our precision-on-demand implementation has an energy requirement that varies linearly with the average bit precision required by the input signal.

Pairs of wavelet coefficients, corresponding to basis functions at adjacent spatial locations, orientations, and scales, are found to be non-Gaussian in both their marginal and joint statistical properties. Specifically, their marginals are heavy-tailed, and although they are typically decorrelated, their magnitudes are highly correlated. We propose a Markov model that explains these dependencies using a linear predictor for magnitude coupled with both multiplicative and additive uncertainties, and show that it accounts for the statistics of a wide variety of images including photographic images, graphical images, and medical images. In order to directly demonstrate the power of the model, we construct an image coder called EPWIC (embedded predictive wavelet image coder), in which subband coefficients are encoded one bitplane at a time using a nonadaptive arithmetic encoder that utilizes conditional probabilities calculated from the model. Bitplanes are ordered using a greedy algorithm that considers the MSE reduction per encoded bit. The decoder uses the statistical model to predict coefficient values based on the bits it has received. Despite the simplicity of the model, the rate-distortion performance of the coder is roughly comparable to the best image coders in the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806616/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6458386","pubMedId":"18267447","volume":"8","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Image compression via joint statistical characterization in the wavelet domain","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image compression via joint statistical characterization in the wavelet domain","sourcePdf":"00806616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037078S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"309","articleId":"806616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":806617,"authors":[{"name":"Youngjun Yoo","affiliation":["Media Technologies Laboratory, DSP Solutions Research and Development Center, Texas Instruments, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Youngjun Yoo","id":"37086981092"},{"name":"A.

This paper deals with a particular type of adaptive subband image coding where we focus on the image coder's ability to adjust itself \"on the fly\" to the spatially varying statistical nature of image contents. This backward adaptation is distinguished from more frequently used forward adaptation in that forward adaptation selects the best operating parameters from a predesigned set and thus uses considerable amount of side information in order for the encoder and the decoder to operate with the same parameters. Specifically, we present backward adaptive quantization using a new context-based classification technique which classifies each subband coefficient based on the surrounding quantized coefficients. We couple this classification with online parametric adaptation of the quantizer applied to each class. A simple uniform threshold quantizer is employed as the baseline quantizer for which adaptation is achieved. Our subband image coder based on the proposed adaptive classification quantization idea exhibits excellent rate-distortion performance, in particular at very low rates. For popular test images, it is comparable or superior to most of the state-of-the-art coders in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/83.806617","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"1702","endPage":"1715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/17485/00806617.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.806617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image subband coding using context-based classification and adaptive quantization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Quantization","Frequency","Compaction","Decoding","Rate-distortion","Testing","Mirrors","Filters","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","adaptive codes","data compression","image classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image subband coding","context-based classification","adaptive quantization","adaptive compression methods","image coding techniques","image content","backward adaptation","backward adaptive quantization","context-based classification technique","online parametric adaptation","uniform threshold quantizer","rate-distortion performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Image subband coding using context-based classification and adaptive quantization","volume":"8","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6458387","pubMedId":"18267448","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806617/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image subband coding using context-based classification and adaptive quantization","sourcePdf":"00806617.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038615S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"49","articleId":"806617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":806628,"authors":[{"name":"A.

These characteristics are ideal for mobile robotic and active vision applications, but have been little used due to the general lack of image processing tools that are applicable to the log-polar coordinate system. Recently, we have described a generalization of the Fourier transform (the fast exponential chirp transform), which allows frame-rate computation of full-field two-dimensional (2-D) frequency transforms directly in log-polar coordinates. In the present work, we show that is possible to achieve full-frame image de-blur at frame rate on a standard \"PC\" platform, using these methods, we illustrate this idea with a Wiener filter based restoration technique. The main contribution of this note is the implementation of (space-variant) image de-blur directly in log-polar coordinates, using the exponential chirp transform. The results show reasonable quality of de-blur, and suggest that these methods are relevant to applications in mobile image processing platforms in which real-time motion deblur is important, and for which it is not desirable to use extensive or custom fabricated hardware.","doi":"10.1109/83.806631","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/17485/00806631.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.806631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17485","startPage":"1838","endPage":"1842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time restoration of images degraded by uniform motion blur in foveal active vision systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time restoration of images degraded by uniform motion blur in foveal active vision systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806631/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6458401","pubMedId":"18267462","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time restoration of images degraded by uniform motion blur in foveal active vision systems","sourcePdf":"00806631.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115554S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"10","articleId":"806631","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":806675,"authors":[{"name":"Jong Boo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics, Induk Institute of Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong Boo Kim","id":"37087198568"},{"name":"Tae Pyo Lee","affiliation":["Central Research Center, Hyundai Motors Company, Yongin si, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tae Pyo Lee","id":"37087199232"},{"name":"Kook Hyun Yim","affiliation":["Research and Development Center, Taesan Precision Company, Yongin si, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kook Hyun Yim","id":"37087198266"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5446-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"806675","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":144},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active noise reduction","Genetic algorithms","IIR filters","Optimal control","Stochastic resonance","Least squares approximation","Stability","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Autocorrelation","Adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward","active noise control","vibration control","IIR filters","adaptive filters","filtering theory","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward IIR active noise control","infinite impulse response filter structure","genetic controllers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806675","abstract":"Presents an active noise control (ANC) algorithm using a genetic algorithm with infinite impulse response (IIR) filter structure. Stochastic gradient algorithms such as the least mean square (LMS) algorithm are conventionally used for their simplicity and stability.

To solve those problems, several researches have been made into adaptive filtering schemes based on genetic algorithms. But their application is limited to the system that is able to know the desired signal directly. In general active noise and vibration control systems are not able to sense the desired signal directly, so they have some difficulties or problems such that learning sample set is proportional to population size. The proposed active controller is composed of genetic controllers that can learn by one sample set per one generation. This structure can be properly applied to active control systems. Computer simulations show that the proposed genetic structured IIR active controller has a more optimal result than feedforward active noise control systems.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1999.806675","pdfPath":"/iel5/6503/17370/00806675.pdf","startPage":"436","endPage":"441 vol. 1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (Cat.

The measured outputs from the system are first used in a Kalman filter to generate residual vectors that serve as fault indicators. As the residuals are generated they can be sent one-by-one to the Kohonen network, both the Kalman filter and the Kohonen network operating in real time. The Kohonen network detects and categorizes the fault, since the residual vectors serve as signatures for different types of faults. The Kohonen network starts with a few pre-designated categories, each category representing a fault type. As more and more residual vectors become available, the Kohonen network opens new categories for residuals that do not have a good enough match with any of the existing categories. The concept is illustrated by an application example that uses actual fault data commercially recorded by the utilities in Texas.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806727/","accessionNumber":"6468293","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-27 Aug. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised neural network for fault detection and classification in dynamic systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised neural network for fault detection and classification in dynamic systems","confLoc":"Kohala Coast, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00806727.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045454S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6503","articleId":"806727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":806737,"authors":[{"name":"K.

DGDC manipulates control inputs directly so as to decrease a performance function like the squared error, based on the gradients of the performance function and the steepest descent method. We propose several methods to improve performances of DGDC. Convergence speed and asymptotical stability of DGDC are improved by two approaches. The first one is to consider time derivative of the performance function. Namely, to improve the convergence, we modify the DGDC by decreasing both the performance function and its time derivative. The second one is to introduce a new artificial control vector and to consider the extended controller for DGDC such that two kinds of performance function are decreased. Our simulation results with the modified DGDC showed very good performances for various plants.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806737/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"22-27 Aug. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6468303","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance improvement of direct gradient descent control for general nonlinear systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance improvement of direct gradient descent control for general nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Kohala Coast, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00806737.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043998S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6503","citationCount":"6","articleId":"806737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":806757,"authors":[{"name":"G.E.

ADVISOR predicts acceleration time to within 0.7% and energy use on the demanding US06 to within 0.6% for an underpowered series hybrid vehicle (0-100 km/h in 20 s). ADVISOR simulates vehicle performance on standard driving cycles between 2.6 and 8.0 times faster than a representative forward-facing vehicle model. Due in large part to ADVISOR's powerful graphical user interface and Web presence, over 800 users have downloaded ADVISOR from 45 different countries.

The statistics of the demodulator output in code acquisition systems are discussed in detail for synchronous cellular CDMA networks with a focus on the nonstationarity of the interference in the forward link.

Numerical evaluations are performed to examine the effects of decision thresholds, postdetection integration, fading rate, and so on, with emphasis on the case where the mobile station is located around the cell boundary.","doi":"10.1109/25.806775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17483/00806775.pdf","startPage":"1819","endPage":"1830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.806775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of a double-dwell serial search technique for cellular CDMA networks in the case of multiple pilot signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806775/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of a double-dwell serial search technique for cellular CDMA networks in the case of multiple pilot signals","volume":"48","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6445942","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of a double-dwell serial search technique for cellular CDMA networks in the case of multiple pilot signals","sourcePdf":"00806775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038875S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"23","articleId":"806775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":806776,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

With a fixed tap-weight architecture that implies zero optimization cost, the conventional signature-matched correlator positions itself as the low-cost low-performance solution. This paper submits a proposal that maintains the same tap-weight architecture and introduces the concept of maximum cross-correlation auxiliary-vector filtering associated with minimum BER adaptive steering. Calculation of the auxiliary vector taps involves standard sample average estimation of the data autocorrelation matrix, and no matrix inversion operation is required. The resulting scalar parametrized filter is optimized adaptively in the minimum BER sense by a fast stochastic approximation recursion on /spl Rscr/. Simplicity and BER comparisons place the proposed receiver competitively on the cost versus performance curve. Numerical results under realistic small sample support scenarios support the theoretical developments and indicate that performance-wise the receiver compares favorably not only to the conventional matched-filter correlator, but also to the minimum-output-energy (MOE) detector the LMS-implemented minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) filter, and the multiuser decorrelating receiver that assumes perfectly known interfering user population.","doi":"10.1109/25.806776","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17483/00806776.pdf","startPage":"1831","endPage":"1839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.806776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auxiliary-vector filters and adaptive steering for DS/CDMA single-user detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806776/","displayDocTitle":"Auxiliary-vector filters and adaptive steering for DS/CDMA single-user detection","volume":"48","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6445943","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auxiliary-vector filters and adaptive steering for DS/CDMA single-user detection","sourcePdf":"00806776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072672S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"20","articleId":"806776","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":806779,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A coordinated time-division multiplexing (TDM) scheme is adopted. Both an isolated cell scenario and a cellular system scenario are taken into consideration. In the single-cell case, closed-form expressions of the optimum power and modulation adaptation law are found. It is shown that the examined techniques offer a similar performance in most cases, although modulation adaptation is somewhat superior to power control in the cellular case. It is made clear that the improvement obtained by adopting an adaptive technique should not be evaluated without specifying the acceptable consequences on service distribution because it is the service distribution that determines the achievable gain ultimately. Previously, a new wireless access system, called Infostations, has been proposed which provides isolated pockets of high-bandwidth connectivity for future data and messaging services. Although the main considerations hold in general, they are particularly useful for defining a time multiplexing scheme for Infostations.","doi":"10.1109/25.806779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17483/00806779.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.806779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17483","startPage":"1862","endPage":"1873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Considerations on adaptive techniques for time-division multiplexing radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Considerations on adaptive techniques for time-division multiplexing radio systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806779/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"48","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6445946","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Considerations on adaptive techniques for time-division multiplexing radio systems","sourcePdf":"00806779.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03384S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","articleId":"806779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":806781,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The convergence speed of the proposed equalizer coefficient adaptation technique and its computational complexity depend on the newly introduced look-back parameter. Both can be tailored to the characteristics of the channel. For achieving convergence speeds comparable to speeds of recursive least squares (RLS) techniques, the computational load of the presented equalization is of the order of the load required of RLS techniques. However, its algorithmic implementation is notably simpler and its code and storage size requirements are smaller. The technique is numerically stable, and it is suitable for low-power implementations in digital signal processors or custom very large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits. Performed simulations verify good performance of the technique in various channel conditions for 900-MHz multipath fading radio channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17483/00806784.pdf","startPage":"1916","endPage":"1922","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.806784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.806784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806784","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity equalization for /spl pi//4 DQPSK signals based on the method of projection onto convex sets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Fading","Convergence","Resonance light scattering","Degradation","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","Iterative methods","Least squares approximation","Computational complexity","Least squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature phase shift keying","differential phase shift keying","adaptive equalisers","multipath channels","Rayleigh channels","nonlinear filters","iterative methods","least squares approximations","recursive estimation","computational complexity","VLSI","application specific integrated circuits","numerical stability","digital signal processing chips","cellular radio","digital radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity equalization","/spl pi//4 DQPSK signals","projection onto convex sets","POCS method","computational complexity","multipath Rayleigh fading channel","differential quadrature phase shift keying","linear transversal-filter-type equalizer","nonlinear transversal-filter-type equalizer","iterative least mean squares","LMS","convergence speed","equalizer coefficient adaptation","look-back parameter","channel characteristics","recursive least squares","RLS","computational load","storage size","code size","numerically stable method","digital signal processors","custom very large-scale integration circuits","VLSI","multipath fading radio channels","simulations","UHF","American Digital Cellular Communication System","900 MHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity equalization for /spl pi//4 DQPSK signals based on the method of projection onto convex sets","volume":"48","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6445951","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity equalization for /spl pi//4 DQPSK signals based on the method of projection onto convex sets","sourcePdf":"00806784.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040898S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","articleId":"806784","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":806786,"authors":[{"name":"L.

We propose a new method, conditional equalization, which minimizes the power consumption due to equalization by equalizing only when it is most needed. At each time slot, the receiver estimates the need for equalization with a deterministic criterion. The proposed criteria use thresholds, chosen to provide a compromise between loss in performance and percentage of saved equalization. The performance of our method is theoretically analyzed for two-path Rayleigh fading channels and simulated for the recommended COST 207 channels. Conditional equalization can ensure a degradation in the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), providing a fixed bit error rate (BER with an average SNR=9 dB with systematic equalization), of less than 0.5 dB while providing a gain of 43% spared equalization for bad urban (BU), 62% for hilly terrain (HT), 79% for typical urban (TU), and 98% for rural area (RA) models, respectively.

The proposed receivers were a high-rate decorrelator (HRD) matched to the data rate of the high-rate users and a low-rate decorrelator (LRD) matched to the data rate of the low-rate users. In this paper, the probabilities of error attainable for high-rate and low-rate users with the use of the HRD and the LRD are analyzed. It is proven that the LRD offers superior performance to that of the HRD for all users. Asymptotic analysis provides bounds for the performance difference for high-rate users. The results are generalized to multirate systems. To increase fidelity, a sliding-window decorrelator (SWD) is proposed which demodulates a high-rate user's data by a soft-decoding rule from the outputs of several decorrelators sliding along the received signal sequence. The results show that it performs better than the HRD while maintaining smaller demodulation delay and computational complexity than the LRD. To further exploit the characteristics of multirate systems, a decorrelating decision-feedback detector is proposed and its asymptotic multiuser efficiency is analyzed. It is shown that this detector incurs little demodulation delay for high-rate users and provides better performance for low-rate users than that of the LRD when the energies of the interfering users are comparable to that of the desired user.","doi":"10.1109/25.806790","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17483/00806790.pdf","startPage":"1966","endPage":"1983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.806790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of decorrelator-based receivers for multirate DS/CDMA communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806790","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806790/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of decorrelator-based receivers for multirate DS/CDMA communications","volume":"48","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6445956","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of decorrelator-based receivers for multirate DS/CDMA communications","sourcePdf":"00806790.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051283S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"24","articleId":"806790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":806791,"authors":[{"name":"Lie-Liang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"lastName":"Lie-Liang Yang","id":"37279441800"},{"name":"L.

In contrast to previous work typically assuming that the frequency shift keying (FSK) tones are nonoverlapping after direct-sequence (DS) spreading, here we consider a spread-spectrum multiple-access (SSMA) system under the assumption that the DS spread signals of different FSK tones are only orthogonal over the information symbol duration. Consequently, the frequency band of a spread FSK tone may be fully or partially overlapping with the other spread signals. An estimate of the variance of the multiple-access interference is obtained by assuming that the phase angles and time delays of the received signals are mutually independent random variables, provided that random signature sequences are employed for spreading. On the basis of the above assumptions, the bit error rate (BER) of our DS spread-spectrum multiple-access (DS-SSMA) and that of our hybrid DS slow frequency-hopping spread-spectrum multiple-access (DS-SFH SSMA) systems using FSK modulation is analyzed, when the channel impairments are constituted by a combination of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multiple-access interference. From our analysis and the numerical results, we concluded that, for a given system bandwidth and for a certain value of M, the system's BER performance can be optimized by controlling the amount of overlapping and that the systems with optimized overlapping outperformed the systems using no overlapping.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/17483/00806791.pdf","startPage":"1984","endPage":"1995","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.806791","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.806791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17483","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overlapping M-ary frequency shift keying spread-spectrum multiple-access systems using random signal sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency shift keying","Spread spectrum communication","Bit error rate","AWGN","Multiple access interference","Demodulation","Delay estimation","Phase estimation","Delay effects","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency shift keying","spread spectrum communication","multi-access systems","random processes","sequences","demodulation","radiofrequency interference","error statistics","radio receivers","AWGN channels","multiuser channels","frequency hop communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["overlapping M-ary frequency shift keying","spread-spectrum multiple-access systems","binary frequency shift keying","BFSK","MFSK","noncoherent demodulation","frequency shift keying","multiple-access interference","SSMA system","DS spread signals","information symbol duration","frequency band","spread FSK tone","phase angles","time delays","mutually independent random variables","random signature sequences","bit error rate","BER","DS spread-spectrum multiple-access","DS-SSMA","hybrid DS slow frequency-hopping","spread-spectrum multiple-access","DS-SFH SSMA","FSK modulation","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN channel","system bandwidth","BER performance","random signal sequences","receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Overlapping M-ary frequency shift keying spread-spectrum multiple-access systems using random signal sequences","volume":"48","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6445957","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overlapping M-ary frequency shift keying spread-spectrum multiple-access systems using random signal sequences","sourcePdf":"00806791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103217S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"23","articleId":"806791","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":806792,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Jun Yang","affiliation":["Telecommunication Laboratories, Chunghwa Telecom Company Limited, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Jun Yang","id":"37351117300"},{"name":"Jin-Fu Chang","affiliation":["National Science Council, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jin-Fu Chang","id":"37280552400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"806792","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":63},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Power control","Multiaccess communication","Land mobile radio","Base stations","Fading","Radio control","Telephony","Feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","cellular radio","power control","telecommunication control","adaptive control","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive power control","CDMA","mobile radio channels","signal strength","signal-to-interference ratio","SIR","enhanced system capacity","adjustable thresholds","base stations","cellular radio"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new power control method for mobile radio channels is proposed and evaluated.

A full-scale three-dimensional drift-diffusion atomistic simulation approach is first described and used to verify more economical, but restricted, options. To reduce processor time and memory requirements at high drain voltage, we have developed a self-consistent option based on a solution of the current continuity equation restricted to a thin slab of the channel. This is coupled to the solution of the Poisson equation in the whole simulation domain in the Gummel iteration cycles. The accuracy of this approach is investigated in comparison to the full self-consistent solution. At low drain voltage, a single solution of the nonlinear Poisson equation is sufficient to extract the current with satisfactory accuracy. In this case, the current is calculated by solving the current continuity equation in a drift approximation only, also in a thin slab containing the MOSFET channel. The regions of applicability for the different components of this hierarchical approach are illustrated in example simulations covering the random dopant-induced threshold voltage fluctuations, threshold voltage lowering, threshold voltage asymmetry, and drain current fluctuations.","doi":"10.1109/43.806802","startPage":"1558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/17482/00806802.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.806802","endPage":"1565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical approach to \"atomistic\" 3-D MOSFET simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806802/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical approach to \"atomistic\" 3-D MOSFET simulation","volume":"18","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6453579","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical approach to \"atomistic\" 3-D MOSFET simulation","sourcePdf":"00806802.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119268S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"66","articleId":"806802","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":806805,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this paper, we present a novel polynomial time algorithm for optimal field programmable gate array (FPGA) mapping with forward retiming to minimize the clock period with efficient initial state computation. It considers forward retiming, initial state computation and mapping simultaneously. Our algorithm enables a new methodology of separating forward retiming from backward retiming. Since we guarantee to compute an optimal mapping with forward retiming solution, backward retiming can be performed as a preprocessing to try to push flip-flops (FFs) to primary inputs with consideration of only initial state computation. Thus, we can avoid the time-consuming iterations between retiming for clock period minimization and initial state computation. This algorithm compares very favorably to both conventional approaches of mapping followed by separate retiming and recent approaches of combined mapping with retiming, but without consideration of initial state computation. Our results show that our algorithm can reduce the clock period by 17.5% over conventional approaches of separate mapping with retiming. On the other hand, our algorithm can guarantee efficient initial state computation in the mapped and retimed circuits with only 2.8% increase in clock period over the optimal mapping with general retiming solutions, while the initial state computation for the latter solutions may need prohibitively long runtime for designs with over several hundred FFs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Clocks","Sequential circuits","Polynomials","Simultaneous localization and mapping","Data preprocessing","Flip-flops","Minimization","Runtime","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","sequential circuits","timing","logic CAD","circuit CAD","integrated circuit design","circuit optimisation","flip-flops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal FPGA mapping","optimal FPGA retiming","initial state computation","sequential circuits","polynomial time algorithm","field programmable gate array","forward retiming","clock period minimization","backward retiming","flip-flops"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806805","doi":"10.1109/43.806805","startPage":"1595","endPage":"1607","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/17482/00806805.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.806805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806805/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal FPGA mapping and retiming with efficient initial state computation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","volume":"18","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6442922","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal FPGA mapping and retiming with efficient initial state computation","sourcePdf":"00806805.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034122S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"10","articleId":"806805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":806812,"authors":[{"name":"Von-Kyoung Kim","affiliation":["Sun Microelectronics, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Von-Kyoung Kim","id":"37357235500"},{"name":"T.

Many memory testing algorithms have been proposed to improve the quality of semiconductor memories by screening out different memory functional faults. However, the relationships between memory function fault types and the types of defects which cause the functional faults are not well understood. Therefore, the effectiveness of memory testing algorithms based on the functional fault models cannot be realistically determined. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of the memory testing algorithms based on the defect coverage by comparing the defect coverage of known memory testing algorithms and the functional fault coverage of the same testing algorithms using the same defect statistics. The experimental results show that the differences among the defect coverage of the 11 memory testing algorithms other than checkerboard and sliding diagonal tests were not significant as previously believed using memory functional fault coverage as the coverage metric.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","volume":"18","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6442928","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"On comparing functional fault coverage and defect coverage for memory testing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On comparing functional fault coverage and defect coverage for memory testing","sourcePdf":"00806812.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032782S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"14","articleId":"806812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":806815,"authors":[{"name":"G.J.

A simplified, but highly spectrally efficient space-time communication processing method is presented. The user's bit stream is mapped to a vector of independently modulated equal bit-rate signal components that are simultaneously transmitted in the same band. A detection algorithm similar to multiuser detection is employed to detect the signal components in white Gaussian noise (WGN). For a large number of antennas, a more efficient architecture can offer no more than about 40% more capacity than the simple architecture presented. A testbed that is now being completed operates at 1.9 GHz with up to 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) transmitters and 16 receive antennas. Under ideal operation at 18 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), using 12 transmit antennas and 16 receive antennas (even with uncoded communication), the theoretical spectral efficiency is 36 bit/s/Hz, whereas the Shannon capacity is 71.1 bit/s/Hz.

This paper shows that the time-frequency cross correlation function rather than the usual (time-domain) cross correlation determines the MAI when the system is operated in the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO), which arises due to the frequency-accuracy limit of the oscillator. Several known sets of sequences having optimized time-domain cross correlation are investigated for their MAI-minimization capabilities in the presence of CFO. It is found that: (i) a system using Walsh codes or Suehiro-Hatori (1985) polyphase sequences can be driven into outage as a result of significant worst-case MAI and (ii) it is possible to minimize the MAI for systems using preferentially phased Gold codes cyclic-shift m-sequences or Lin-Chang 9see ibid., vol.45, p.221-6, 1997) sequences only if the product of chip period and maximum frequency deviation is less than around 0.01.

This implies working with matrices with dimensions proportional to the product of the data package length and the number of active users. In this paper, we present an alternative approach. This alternative consists of a type of multistage detector that overcomes the MAI and ISI problems; in addition, it has complexity proportional to the number of CDMA users, is computationally efficient, and is suitable for pipeline implementation which allows fast data processing.

In the CDMA uplink, however, typically the base station receiver has the knowledge of the spreading sequences of all the users within the cell, but not that of the users from other cells. In this paper, group-blind techniques are developed for multiuser detection in such scenarios. These new techniques make use of the spreading sequences and the estimated multipath channels of all known users to suppress the intracell interference, while blindly suppressing the intercell interference. Several forms of group-blind linear detectors are developed based on different criteria. Moreover, group-blind multiuser detection in the presence of correlated noise is also considered. In this case, two receiving antennas are needed for channel estimation and signal separation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed group-blind linear multiuser detection techniques offer substantial performance gains over the blind linear multiuser detection methods in a CDMA uplink environment.","doi":"10.1109/49.806826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17481/00806826.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.806826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17481","startPage":"1971","endPage":"1984","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group-blind multiuser detection for uplink CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Group-blind multiuser detection for uplink CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806826/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6454906","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group-blind multiuser detection for uplink CDMA","sourcePdf":"00806826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051325S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"98","articleId":"806826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":806827,"authors":[{"name":"V.

In this paper, we consider a code division multiplex (CDM) scheme for satellite DAB. For diversity purposes, this system makes use of at least two satellites, and in urban areas, where the satellite signals are shadowed by large structures, a terrestrial network is employed. We present a forward error protection (FEC) scheme that is robust under a variety of channel conditions, especially in cases where the received signal is severely attenuated because of highway underpasses and tunnels. This FEC scheme makes use of time diversity, and this introduces a large delay. Such delays will not affect the performance of broadcast systems; however, the delay will be an issue during tuning when a switch to another channel occurs. We introduce a separate low-delay low-rate tuning channel to facilitate tuning. Extensive simulation results are given to examine the performance of the system, and it is shown that about 70 audio channels, each with a rate of 96 kbit/s, can be satisfactorily supported in a bandwidth of approximately 12.5 MHz in most of the channel conditions considered.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6454907","displayDocTitle":"A code division multiplexing scheme for satellite digital audio broadcasting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A code division multiplexing scheme for satellite digital audio broadcasting","sourcePdf":"00806827.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068997S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"1","articleId":"806827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":806828,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.

The capabilities of the intended recipients may vary in the sense that the communication links to some neighbors may have less interference or attenuation than the links to others. We have previously proposed the use of nonuniform phase-shift key (PSK) signal constellations to allow a transmitter to deliver a basic message to each of the intended receivers and an additional message to the more-capable receivers. In this paper, convolutional coding and nonuniform PSK modulation are combined to provide greater efficiency and increased flexibility. The primary goal of multicast transmission, which is for each designated neighbor to have an acceptable probability of receiving the multicast message correctly, is achieved in a way that permits inclusion of multimedia messages for the more-capable receivers. Performance results and tradeoffs are presented for hard- and soft-decision decoding of convolutionally encoded coherent M-ary PSK multicast transmissions. Our results show that convolutional coding can be used with nonuniform PSK modulation to transmit additional information in mobile communication systems with little degradation to the basic information.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806828/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","volume":"17","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"6454908","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multimedia multicast wireless communications with phase-shift-key modulation and convolutional coding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimedia multicast wireless communications with phase-shift-key modulation and convolutional coding","sourcePdf":"00806828.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0406S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"26","articleId":"806828","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":806831,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In the context of time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, this interest has led to the development of a variety of dynamic channel assignment (DCA) and power control (PC) algorithms. Despite the intense activity in both the DCA and the PC arenas and some proposals for combined DCA with PC, not enough work has been devoted to effectively integrating them. In this paper, the integration of DCA and PC is investigated and a family of integrated algorithms is presented. These algorithms, fully distributed and cost adaptive, achieve capacity levels significantly higher than those of a system with only DCA or PC. With respect to a system without any DCA or PC, several-fold capacity increases are obtained. Furthermore, these capacity levels are attained with user mobility included in the analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/17481/00806831.pdf","startPage":"2031","endPage":"2040","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.806831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.806831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated dynamic channel assignment and power control in TDMA mobile wireless communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Time division multiple access","Wireless communication","Energy management","Radio spectrum management","Resource management","Power system management","Context","Proposals","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time division multiple access","land mobile radio","channel allocation","power control","telecommunication congestion control","multiuser channels","digital radio","distributed algorithms","channel capacity","adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TDMA mobile wireless communication systems","integrated dynamic channel assignment","power control","analog mobile wireless communications systems","digital third-generation systems","digital second-generation systems","radio spectrum","time division multiple access","DCA algorithm","integrated algorithms","cost adaptive algorithms","distributed algorithms","capacity levels","admission control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806831/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Integrated dynamic channel assignment and power control in TDMA mobile wireless communication systems","volume":"17","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6454911","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated dynamic channel assignment and power control in TDMA mobile wireless communication systems","sourcePdf":"00806831.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09613S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"27","articleId":"806831","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":806834,"authors":[{"name":"T.C.

The master and slave manipulators are controlled in impedance mode, with their target impedances adjusted in a dual manner to match high or low impedance environments. The adjustment rules presented use the relative sizes of forces and velocities to simply interpolate between low and high impedance controllers. The method was justified by the success of dual-hybrid teleoperation and is demonstrated to work using a simulator driven by a maglev force-feedback joystick. Experimental results using the same maglev force-feedback joystick to control an excavator are also presented, demonstrating through a typical leveling task that this method can work well in practice. The ratio of forces to velocities for deciding the master and slave impedances seems to be an effective method for dealing with extreme environment conditions, namely, free motion or hard constraint.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bilateral matched impedance teleoperation with application to excavator control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","doi":"10.1109/37.806913","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/5488303/17489/00806913.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.806913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806913/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Bilateral matched impedance teleoperation with application to excavator control","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6432286","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bilateral matched impedance teleoperation with application to excavator control","sourcePdf":"00806913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040039S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"64","articleId":"806913","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":806932,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

We propose a novel method for automatic hypertext generation that is based on a technique called lexical chaining, a method for discovering sequences of related words in a text. This method uses a more general notion of document relatedness, and attempts to take into account the effects of synonymy and polysemy. We also present the results of an empirical study designed to test this method in the context of a question answering task from a database of newspaper articles.","doi":"10.1109/69.806932","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","startPage":"713","endPage":"730","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/69/17490/00806932.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/69.806932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Building hypertext links by computing semantic similarity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Information retrieval","Databases","Buildings","Humans","Costs","Large-scale systems","Writing","Automatic testing","System testing","Computational linguistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hypermedia","text analysis","computational linguistics","information retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hypertext links","semantic similarity","automatic hypertext generation systems","term repetition","document relatedness","synonymy","polysemy","automatic hypertext generation","lexical chaining","question answering task","newspaper article database","information retrieval"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Building hypertext links by computing semantic similarity","volume":"11","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6437387","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806932/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Building hypertext links by computing semantic similarity","sourcePdf":"00806932.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063988S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1999","isNumber":"17490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"49","articleId":"806932","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":806935,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Unlike traditional mobile wireless networks, ad hoc networks do not rely on any fixed infrastructure. Instead, hosts rely on each other to keep the network connected. Military tactical and other security-sensitive operations are still the main applications of ad hoc networks, although there is a trend to adopt ad hoc networks for commercial uses due to their unique properties. One main challenge in the design of these networks is their vulnerability to security attacks. In this article, we study the threats on ad hoc network faces and the security goals to be achieved. We identify the new challenges and opportunities posed by this new networking environment and explore new approaches to secure its communication. In particular, we take advantage of the inherent redundancy in ad hoc networks-multiple routes between nodes-to defend routing against denial-of-service attacks. We also use replication and new cryptographic schemes, such as threshold cryptography, to build a highly secure and highly available key management service, which terms the core of our security framework.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Securing ad hoc networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","doi":"10.1109/65.806983","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel5/65/17493/00806983.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/65.806983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17493","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=806983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/806983/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Securing ad hoc networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6447131","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Securing ad hoc networks","sourcePdf":"00806983.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051852S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1999","isNumber":"17493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"1122","articleId":"806983","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":807162,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In applications such as video browsing, and picture in picture, for a lower bitrate there is a need to down-sample the video before transmission. The conventional approach to downscale a compressed video sequence is to decompress it at the video server, perform the down-sampling in the pixel domain and recompress it again for efficient delivery. This process is computationally expensive due to the motion estimation process needed during the recompression phase. In the alternative compressed domain based approach the downscaled motion vectors are computed directly from the original ones. We propose a method to improve the process of downscaling in the compressed domain by better selecting the motion prediction type of P and B frame macroblocks. Simulations suggest that the proposed scheme improves the compressed domain down-sampling quality by up to 2.2 dB without any substantial increase in computation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.1999.807167","publicationTitle":"Engineering Solutions for the Next Millennium. 1999 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (Cat.

Each link has a cost representing the desirability of using that particular link. The shortest path then becomes the path in which the total link cost from a source node to a destination node is minimized. While there are many conventional algorithms available, non of them are without drawbacks. In order to find a better solution, the use of Hopfield neural network as a routing algorithm is explored in this paper. This approach is based on a solution proposed for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The routing problem is considerably similar to the TSP problem in that it is concerned with finding an optimal route which connects a source node with a destination node. The neural network architecture is implemented and tested, and a comparison between the neural solution and the conventional routing algorithms is also presented. The neural network gives approximately 97.3% of optimum routes, this represents a significant improvement over other neural network approaches already implemented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 May 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/807186/","accessionNumber":"6497008","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"9-12 May 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application of Hopfield neural network in routing for computer networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Hopfield neural network in routing for computer networks","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"00807186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078633S","chronDate":"9-12 May 1999","isNumber":"17477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6536","citationCount":"4","articleId":"807186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":807193,"authors":[{"name":"J.-P.

This performance is achieved with a low-cost Xilinx 4000E series FPGA with a -3 speed grade. A very high internal resource utilization of 83% was attained while meeting stringent timing requirements via the use of computationally efficient signal processing algorithms, thorough logic optimization, and careful mapping of signal processing algorithms to hardware.

Among the methods for studying their behaviour, the most widely used has been trace-driven simulation. Nevertheless, analytical modeling gives more information and requires smaller computation times that allow it to be used in the compilation step to drive automatic optimizations on the code. The traditional drawback of analytical modeling has been its limited precision and the lack of techniques to apply it systematically without user intervention. In this work we present a methodology to build analytical models for codes with regular access patterns. These models can be applied to caches with an arbitrary size, line size and associativity.

This paper explores the use of neural networks for real-time, model-based feedback control of RIE. This objective is accomplished in part by constructing a predictive model for the system, which can be inverted (or approximately inverted) to achieve the desired control. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated using experimental data from a SiO/sub 2/ etch process to simulate real-time control of etch rate, uniformity, selectivity, and anisotropy. In addition, using a residual gas analysis system as a sensor, the approach is further demonstrated using actual experimental data acquired during the etch of a GaAs/AlGaAs metal-semiconductor-metal structure. In the latter case, real-time control of the etch rate of the constituent materials is investigated.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1999.807760","startPage":"779","endPage":"783 vol. 1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1999 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (Cat.

To tackle the most difficult situations, the retained control architecture comprises several degrees-of-freedom in terms of dynamic feedback loops, each consisting of a high-order differential filter. The tuning of these flexible controllers is then performed by minimizing a selective modal performance index in the parameter space. Adding stability and robustness constraints greatly improves the engineering significance of the resulting design. Three examples adapted from the literature are used for illustration: a robust power system stabilizer (PSS) for a single-machine infinite-bus system with multiple operating points, a thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC) controller for a large power system, and a coordinated design of multiple PSSs for a two-area/four-machine test system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/807773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-27 Aug. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6468324","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimization-based tuning and coordination of flexible damping controllers for bulk power systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization-based tuning and coordination of flexible damping controllers for bulk power systems","confLoc":"Kohala Coast, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00807773.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075319S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17370","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6503","citationCount":"5","articleId":"807773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":807774,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Modern state-of-the-art powertrain systems may combine several power sources (internal combustion engines, electric motors, fuel cells, etc.) and various exhaust aftertreatment devices (catalytic converters, lean NOx traps, particulate filters, etc.) in addition to conventional engine subsystems such as turbochargers and exhaust gas recirculation. The determination of the way in which these systems need to be operated to meet driver's torque demand, performance and fuel economy expectations while satisfying federal emission regulations is a complex and a multiobjective optimal control problem.

The presented system aims at the improvement of the quality of the generated fuzzy rules, producing blocks of effective rules and more compact rule bases. This is achieved by encoding the fuzzy rules in the chromosomes in a suitable form in order to make the bacterial operation more effective and by using a crossover operation that adaptively decides the cutting points according to the distribution of degrees of truth values of the rules. In this paper, first, results obtained when using the PBGA for a simple fuzzy modeling problem are presented and compared with other methods. Second, the PBGA is used in the design of a fuzzy logic controller for a semi-active suspension system.

Every generated numerical rule is accumulated in a lookup table called a numerical-rule-based controller (NRC). In the secondary stage, both antecedent and consequent variables of the numerical rules are fuzzified by training MLPs with the backpropagation algorithm. All training data are directly derived from the NRC with simple manipulations. Consequently, a linguistic-rule-based controller (LRC) consisting of the generated fuzzy rules is completed. Two illustrative experiments are successfully made on the computer simulation and hardware implementation of the NRCs and LRCs of different types using the new EA combined with the MLPs. The experimental results reveal that the proposed EA-MLP MLP approach is efficient and effective to generate fuzzy rules which control nonlinearly dynamical systems exceedingly well.","doi":"10.1109/41.807995","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/17505/00807995.pdf","startPage":"1103","endPage":"1113","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.807995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy rules generation using new evolutionary algorithms combined with multilayer perceptrons","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/807995/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy rules generation using new evolutionary algorithms combined with multilayer perceptrons","volume":"46","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6443309","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy rules generation using new evolutionary algorithms combined with multilayer perceptrons","sourcePdf":"00807995.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041501S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"14","articleId":"807995","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":808009,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In it, the alternating direction implicit (ADI) technique is applied in formulating the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm. Although the resulting formulations are computationally more complicated than the conventional FDTD, the proposed FDTD is very appealing since the time step used in the simulation is no longer restricted by stability but by accuracy. As a result, computation speed can be improved.

With an electrically wide aperture formed on the common ground plane of two-layered microstrip line structures, a significant enhancement of capacitively series coupling is observed at low frequency. This simple technique realizes a very flat frequency response of transmission over a very broad bandwidth. A two-layered transition is accurately characterized by applying a so-called \"short-open calibration\" (SOC) scheme to calibrate numerical results obtained from a full-wave method of moments (MoM). The transition shows several attractive features such as ultrabroad bandwidth, low radiation loss, and deep up-band rejection. Predictions are verified by measurements over a wide frequency range.","doi":"10.1109/75.808032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/75/17503/00808032.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.808032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrabroad-band vertical transition for multilayer integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Ultrabroad-band vertical transition for multilayer integrated circuits","volume":"9","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6448552","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/808032/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrabroad-band vertical transition for multilayer integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00808032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027556S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"39","articleId":"808032","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":808036,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The use of Lamb waves generated by an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT) as a probe allows us to test metallic welds; in this work, the case of aluminum weld is treated. We explain how we proceed to do the feature extraction by using a method of analysis based on the wavelet transform of the ultrasonic testing signals; we propose a classification process of the features based on a neural classifier to interpret the results in terms of weld quality. The aim of this complete process of analysis and classification of the NDT ultrasonic signals is to lead to an automated system of weld or structure testing. Results of real-world ultrasonic Lamb waves signals analysis and classification for an aluminum weld are presented; these proved the feasibility of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1999.808041","publicationTitle":"Engineering Solutions for the Next Millennium. 1999 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (Cat.

Although based on an existing local search algorithm, the proposed optimization technique does not make any recourse to the concept of an optimal scale factor. Consequently, it permits both the optimization of finite-impulse-response (FIR) digital filters (as is the case in the hitherto optimization techniques) as well as the that of the corresponding infinite-impulse response (IIR) digital filters. The usefulness of the proposed technique is demonstrated through its application to the optimization of a bandpass IIR and a lowpass FIR digital filter.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1999.808066","startPage":"811","endPage":"816 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Engineering Solutions for the Next Millennium. 1999 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (Cat.

We first define a new cost model for routing in (optical) WDM networks that is more general than the existing models. Our model takes into consideration not only the cost of wavelength access and conversion but also the delay for queuing signals arriving at different input channels that share the same output channel at the same node. We then propose a set of efficient algorithms in a reliable WDM network on the new cost model for each of the three most important communication patterns-multiple point-to-point routing, multicast, and multiple multicast. Finally, we show how to obtain a set of efficient algorithms in an unreliable WDM network with up to f faulty optical channels and wavelength conversion gates. Our strategy is to first enhance the physical paths constructed by the algorithms for reliable networks to ensure success of fault-tolerant routing, and then to route among the enhanced paths to establish a set of fault-free physical routes to complete the corresponding routing request for each of the communication patterns.","doi":"10.1109/71.808141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.808141","startPage":"1012","endPage":"1025","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/17501/00808141.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient fault-tolerant routing in multihop optical WDM networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","displayDocTitle":"Efficient fault-tolerant routing in multihop optical WDM networks","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"10","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6448263","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/808141/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient fault-tolerant routing in multihop optical WDM networks","sourcePdf":"00808141.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040953S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"16","articleId":"808141","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":808183,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

The status monitoring information measured in these networks is affected by noise, temperature, and other external elements making closed-form solutions impractical. Existing techniques utilizing recurrent neural networks have been developed to analyze and reliably detect faults in such a system. However, due to changes in amplifier behaviour such neural networks often need to be retrained, introducing significant computational expense when used on a large data set. To solve this problem a technique is needed to quickly scan through data for such a system and only pass questionable amplifiers on to more time consuming and rigorous routines. This work presents a means by which statistics and feed-forward neural networks can be used to categorize the forward pilot signal to make implementation of a large-scale model-based fault detection system feasible.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1999.808183","startPage":"1008","endPage":"1013 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Engineering Solutions for the Next Millennium. 1999 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (Cat.

The principle consists of combining finite element analysis with experimental measurements to determine the equivalent transverse electrical conductivity of a single sheet. The calculation is based on the assumption that the eddy-current losses are the same under the same flux density condition. The experimental conditions are reproduced in the simulation. Saturation effects have been taken into account. Varying the conductivity value step by step, the simulation repeats until eddy-current losses match that obtained in the experimental case. The 2D-finite element method is applied to obtain the flux density waveform at all points of a sheet. Eddy-current losses are determined on the basis of the field analysis. The equivalent conductivity obtained in this way can be used for modeling the magnetic circuit of an induction motor. The sheets used in this paper are taken from a 50-HP squirrel cage induction motor.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.1999.808214","publicationTitle":"Engineering Solutions for the Next Millennium. 1999 IEEE Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (Cat.

However, the decompression time causes a critical effect on the memory access time and variable-sized compressed blocks tend to increase the design complexity of the compressed cache architecture. This paper suggests several techniques to reduce the decompression overhead and to manage the compressed blocks efficiently which include selective compression, fixed space allocation for the compressed blocks, parallel decompression, the use of a decompression buffer, and so on. Moreover a simple compressed cache architecture based on the above techniques and its management method are proposed. The results from trace-driven simulation show that this approach can provide around 35% decrease in the on-chip cache miss ratio as well as a 53% decrease in the data traffic over the conventional memory systems. Also, a large amount of the decompression overhead can be reduced, and thus the average memory access time can also be reduced by maximum 20% against the conventional memory systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/808424/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6422936","publicationDate":"1999","conferenceDate":"10-13 Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and evaluation of a selective compressed memory system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and evaluation of a selective compressed memory system","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00808424.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038943S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6554","citationCount":"24","articleId":"808424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":808425,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Kang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Yi Kang","id":"37365341400"},{"name":"Wei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Wei Huang","id":"37436235800"},{"name":"Seung-Moon Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Seung-Moon Yoo","id":"37365711700"},{"name":"D.

The contribution of this paper is to explore one way to use the current state-of-the-art MLD technology for general-purpose computers. To satisfy requirements of general purpose and low programming cost, we place the PIM chips in the memory system and let them default to plain DRAM if the application is not enabled for intelligent memory. Since wide usability is crucial, we identify and analyze a range of real applications for PIM. Based on the requirements of these applications and current technological constraints, we design a PIM chip and a PIM-based memory system. We call the chip FlexRAM. We describe FlexRAM's design and floorplan, and the resulting memory system. Evaluation of the system through simulations shows that 4 FlexRAM chips often allow a workstation to run 25-40 times faster.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1999.808425","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors (Cat.

We show that if the CLB has b bases, a tree network with n nodes can be mapped in O(C/spl middot/n/sup 2b-1/) time, where C is a function dependent on b. b is fired for a given CLB architecture. In particular this algorithm runs in O (n/sup 5/) time when mapping a circuit of n nodes onto the Xilinx XC4000. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first optimal polynomial time algorithm for mapping any nontrivial network onto such a complex CLB architecture. By simplifying the computation, we obtained an O(n/sup 3/) algorithm. The mapping results are comparable to the best NP-hard MILP approach, but our algorithm runs in polynomial time and is much faster in practice. The larger MCNC benchmark circuits were mapped in a few minutes. Our algorithm also maps to CLBs with independent, heterogeneous LUTs as a special case.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1999.808428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1999.808428","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors (Cat.

A recent trend in design automation has been to integrate placement and logic synthesis operations for designs that strive for high performance. The motivation for this is ascribed to achieving timing convergence. These efforts attempt a brute-force combination of techniques from the two fields. We present an architecture for combining synthesis transforms with rough placement. There are three main contributions of this paper. First we present a system architecture that permits a clean separation of placement and synthesis issues and combines the two solutions in an elegant manner. Second, we propose a minor modification to the current ASIC design flow to enable timing convergence. Third, we use design rules for correct circuit operation to drive the placement and the synthesis components of the system.

Chang et al., 1996). We present an algorithm to construct N-sided universal switch blocks with W terminals on each side. Each of our universal switch blocks has (/sub 2//sup N/)W switches and switch-block flexibility N-1 (i.e., F/sub S/=N-1). We prove that no switch block with less than (/sub 2//sup N/)W switches can be universal. Further, the decomposition property of a universal switch block provides a key insight into its layout implementation with a smaller silicon area. We also compare our universal switch blocks with others of the topology associated with Xilinx XC4000-type FPGAs. Experimental results demonstrate that our universal switch blocks improve routability at the chip level.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generic universal switch blocks","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors (Cat.

Extrapolating current trends, this portion is likely to increase in the near future, since the devices devoted to the caches occupy an increasingly larger percentage of the total area of the chip. We extend the work proposed by J. Kin et al. (1997), in which an extra, small cache (called filter cache) is inserted between the CPU data path and the L1 cache and serves to filter most of the references initiated from the CPU. In our scheme, the compiler is used to generate code that exploits the new memory hierarchy and reduces the possibility of a miss in the extra cache. Experimental results across a wide range of SPEC95 benchmarks show that this cache, which we call L-Cache, has a small performance overhead with respect to the scheme without any extra caches, and provides substantial energy savings. The L-Cache is placed between the CPU and the I-Cache. The D-Cache subsystem is not modified. Since the L-Cache is much smaller, and thus, has a smaller access time than the I-Cache, this scheme can also be used for performance improvements provided that the hit rate in the L-Cache is very high. In our experimental results, we show that the L-Cache does indeed improve performance in some cases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy and performance improvements in microprocessor design using a loop cache","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors (Cat.

The processor is targeted for embedded use in media-processing devices like DTVs and set-top boxes. Intended as a core, its design must be supplemented with on-chip co-processors to obtain a cost-effective system. Good performance is obtained through a uniform 64-bit 5 issue-slot VLIW design, supporting subword parallelism with an extensive instruction set optimized with respect to media-processing. Multi-slot 'super-ops' allow powerful multi-argument and multi-result operations. As an example, the IDCT algorithm shows a very low instruction count in comparison with other processors. To achieve good performance, critical sections in the application program source code need to be rewritten with vector data types and function calls for media operations. Benchmarking with several media applications was used to tune the instruction set and study cache behaviour. This resulted in a VLIW architecture with wide data paths and relatively simple CPU control.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Conference on Computer Design: VLSI in Computers and Processors (Cat.

Results with different measurement noises and different measured performances are presented.

The conceptual basis of the analysis is that electrostatic force should be applied only where it is most effective, such as at the center of a circular membrane. If breakdown mechanisms are ignored, an infinitesimally small electrode with an infinite bias voltage results in the optimal transducer. A more realistic design example compares the 3-dB bandwidths of a fully metalized transducer and a partially metalized transducer, each tuned with a lossless Butterworth network. It is found that the bandwidth of the optimally metalized device is twice that of the fully metalized device.","doi":"10.1109/58.808859","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/17519/00808859.pdf","startPage":"1364","endPage":"1374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.808859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory and analysis of electrode size optimization for capacitive microfabricated ultrasonic transducers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=808859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/808859/","displayDocTitle":"Theory and analysis of electrode size optimization for capacitive microfabricated ultrasonic transducers","volume":"46","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6447001","pubMedId":"18244332","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory and analysis of electrode size optimization for capacitive microfabricated ultrasonic transducers","sourcePdf":"00808859.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023591S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"80","articleId":"808859","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":808869,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In transmission, conventional array aperture windowing implies a different driving voltage for each element of the array, an expensive solution for systems with a large number of channels. In this paper, we present a simple, versatile, and inexpensive beamforming method that operates the aperture windowing in the transmit mode, simply controlling the lengths of the electric pulses driving the array elements. Computer simulations and experimental measurements are presented for different types of arrays. They confirm that the proposed beamforming technique improves the contrast resolution of the imaging system, reducing the off-axis intensity of the radiated field pattern. Moreover, the axial resolution is slightly enhanced, because the overall length of the transmitted ultrasonic pulse is reduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/17519/00808869.pdf","startPage":"1450","endPage":"1458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.808869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.808869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17519","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=808869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient transmit beamforming in pulse-echo ultrasonic imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Ultrasonic imaging","Phased arrays","Apertures","Pulse amplifiers","Ultrasonic transducer arrays","Pulse shaping methods","Delay effects","Voltage","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic imaging","acoustic pulses","echo","array signal processing","acoustic signal processing","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit beamforming","pulse-echo ultrasonic imaging","array aperture windowing","computer simulation","contrast resolution","time delay","acoustic field pattern"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/808869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Efficient transmit beamforming in pulse-echo ultrasonic imaging","volume":"46","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6447011","pubMedId":"18244342","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient transmit beamforming in pulse-echo ultrasonic imaging","sourcePdf":"00808869.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043929S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"12","articleId":"808869","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":808876,"authors":[{"name":"Q.M.

In hard PZT ceramics, the local defect fields built up during the aging process can stabilize the ceramic against external stress depoling that results in a marked increase in the piezoelectric coefficient and electromechanical coupling factor in the ceramic under the stress.

A global medical system, including hardware elements and a software package, has been designed for this application. A motorization set and electronic boards enable this new oscillating probe to be used with any recent echograph equipped with a cardiac module and an external triggering cineloop. Moreover, in order to obtain 3D/4D left ventricle movements from a set of 2D recorded images, a rendering method based on the 2D discrete Fourier transform is applied.

Implementing multiple sampling, however, requires much higher readout speeds than can be achieved using typical CMOS active pixel sensor (APS). This paper demonstrates, using a 640/spl times/512 CMOS image sensor with 8-b bit-serial Nyquist rate analog-to-digital converter (ADC) per 4 pixels, that pixel-level ADC enables a highly flexible and efficient implementation of multiple sampling to enhance dynamic range. Since pixel values are available to the ADC's at all times, the number and timing of the samples as well as the number of bits obtained from each sample can be freely selected and read out at fast SRAM speeds. By sampling at exponentially increasing exposure times, pixel values with binary floating-point resolution can be obtained. The 640/spl times/512 sensor is implemented in 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS technology and achieves 10.5/spl times/10.5 /spl mu/m pixel size at 29% fill factor. Characterization techniques and measured quantum efficiency, sensitivity, ADC transfer curve, and fixed pattern noise are presented. A scene with measured dynamic range exceeding 10000:1 is sampled nine times to obtain an image with dynamic range of 65536:1. Limits on achievable dynamic range using multiple sampling are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/808907/","volume":"34","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"6456156","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 640/spl times/512 CMOS image sensor with ultrawide dynamic range floating-point pixel-level ADC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 640/spl times/512 CMOS image sensor with ultrawide dynamic range floating-point pixel-level ADC","sourcePdf":"00808907.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054262S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"188","articleId":"808907","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":808908,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The transmitted Gaussian minimum shift keying signal has an RMS average phase error <2/spl deg/, and the overall current consumption of the transmitter is 55 mA.","doi":"10.1109/4.808912","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/17515/00808912.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.808912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17515","startPage":"1869","endPage":"1880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 20-mA-receive, 55-mA-transmit, single-chip GSM transceiver in 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=808912","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 20-mA-receive, 55-mA-transmit, single-chip GSM transceiver in 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/808912/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6456160","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 20-mA-receive, 55-mA-transmit, single-chip GSM transceiver in 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS","sourcePdf":"00808912.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044107S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"53","articleId":"808912","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":808913,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The chip consists of two parallel transmitters that are both fully operational from 100 MHz up to 1.1 GHz. Using a single-ended current-mode output topology, the radio-frequency (RF) output signals are lossless combined by summing the output currents. The third-order harmonic of the oscillator signal is filtered by a wide-band polyphase filter. The complex filtering operation is mathematically described in this paper. The on-chip integrated oscillators have a measured 55-1200 MHz tuning range. Using the polyphase filter, a linear mixer topology, and a linear output driver, all distortion components are below -40 dBc. All intermodulation products of the two channels are smaller than -48 dBc. In this way, it is guaranteed that the parallel channels do not disturb the other channels in the frequency band even without any channel-specific filtering. Each channel delivers the designed -16-dBm RF output signal. The measured transmitter noise floor is situated at -139.8 dBc/Hz.

An adjustable data rate from 160 to 768 kb/s is employed to achieve N/spl times/64 kb/s voice channel (N=2-12). The IC contains a 14-bit, 63 dual current sources multibit /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ digital-to-analog converter with \"hopping\" dynamic elements, a /spl Sigma//spl Delta/ analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and an on-chip high-swing nested Miller line driver; and for full duplex communication an integrated -30 dB rejection hybrid filter based on line and transformer parasitics matching. The concept has been tested using two sets of silicon test chips, one for symmetrical digital subscriber line (SDSL) and one for asymmetrical DSL (ADSL), on a line emulator with and without additive line noise for SDSL and ADSL rates (line driver external for ADSL with fourth-order multibit ADC for ADSL). In the analog front end, supply is 3 V for all the digital blocks, including the interface to the digital portion of the DSL, and 5 V for all the analog blocks. Power is 250 mW, with 12-mm/sup 2/ area. The transceiver can cover the full set of ANSI T1.601 basic rate ISDN (UkO-interface) loops while providing 2.5 times the throughput of existing U-interface transceivers. Nearly five times the throughput (768 kb/s) can be achieved even in the presence of worst case self-crosstalk. The additional performance is achieved by using a combination of coding, digital, and analog techniques.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DSL","Transceivers","Testing","Additive noise","Throughput","Wire","Analog integrated circuits","Hybrid integrated circuits","Digital integrated circuits","Digital-analog conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","transceivers","digital subscriber lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analog IC","multiple-bit-rate DSL transceiver","digital subscriber loop","front-end","ADSL","SDSL","160 to 768 kbit/s","3 V","5 V","14 bit","250 mW"]}],"doi":"10.1109/4.808921","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/17515/00808921.pdf","startPage":"1961","endPage":"1972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.808921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 25-kft, 768-kb/s CMOS analog front end for multiple-bit-rate DSL transceiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=808921","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 25-kft, 768-kb/s CMOS analog front end for multiple-bit-rate DSL transceiver","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/808921/","volume":"34","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6456168","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 25-kft, 768-kb/s CMOS analog front end for multiple-bit-rate DSL transceiver","sourcePdf":"00808921.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04353S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"6","articleId":"808921","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":808944,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Options for increasing text entry rate include 1) dynamically changing the configuration of the row-column matrix or 2) using rate-enhancement techniques like word prediction, but evidence suggests that increased cognitive load imposed by these methods on the user can result in little or no improvement in test generation rate. An alternative we are investigating is adapting a system's scan delay during run-time. Our goal is to allow a scanning system to adjust its parameters \"on the fly\" (as opposed to the current practice of setting parameters during clinical assessments). This paper describes the evolution of a one-switch row-column scanning system that adapts its scan rate based on measurements of user performance. Two experiments have been performed to explore the effects of automatically adapting scan delay on users' test entry rate. Our results indicate that automatic adaptation has the potential to enhance test-entry rate without increasing task complexity.","doi":"10.1109/86.808950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.808950","endPage":"473","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/86/17527/00808950.pdf","startPage":"464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive one-switch row-column scanning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/808950/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive one-switch row-column scanning","volume":"7","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6458890","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"10609634","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive one-switch row-column scanning","sourcePdf":"00808950.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03577S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"64","articleId":"808950","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":808951,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Luen Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hwa-Hsia College of Technology and Commerce, Department of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Luen Chen","id":"37087292772"},{"name":"Fuk-Tan Tang","affiliation":["Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fuk-Tan Tang","id":"37086997605"},{"name":"W.H.

This system may serve to assist those who suffer from spinal cord injuries or other handicaps to operate a computer. This system is comprised of three major components: 1) an infrared transmitting module, 2) an infrared receiving/signal-processing module, and 3) a main controller, the Intel-8951 microprocessor. The infrared transmitting module utilizes tongue-touch circuitry which is converted to an infrared beam and a low power laser (<0.1 mW) beam. The infrared receiving/signal-processing module, receives the infrared beam and fine tunes the unstable infrared beam into standard pulses which are used as control signals. The main controller is responsible for detecting the input signals from the infrared receiving/signal-processing module and verifying these signals with the mapping table in its memory. After the signal is verified, it is released to control the keys of the computer keyboard and mouse interface. This design concept was mainly based on the idea that the use of an infrared remote module fastened to the eyeglasses could allow the convenient control of the input motion on the keys of a computer keyboard and mouse which are all modified with infrared receiving/signal-processing modules. The system is designed for individuals with spinal cord injuries and disabled in which the subjects' movement are severely restricted. The infrared transmitting module can be easily mounted on eyeglasses or artificial limbs.","doi":"10.1109/86.808951","pdfPath":"/iel5/86/17527/00808951.pdf","startPage":"474","endPage":"481","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.808951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The new design of an infrared-controlled human-computer interface for the disabled","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/808951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"The new design of an infrared-controlled human-computer interface for the disabled","volume":"7","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6458891","pubMedId":"10609635","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The new design of an infrared-controlled human-computer interface for the disabled","sourcePdf":"00808951.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039484S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17527","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"72","articleId":"808951","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":808962,"authors":[{"name":"N.R.

The performance of the radar is described, together with the initial results of a scanning of the antenna beam.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/17526/00808965.pdf","startPage":"2237","endPage":"2241","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.808965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.808965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17526","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=808965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 77-GHz FM/CW radar front-end with a low-profile low-loss printed antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar antennas","Frequency","Circuits","Gunn devices","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Finline","Transmitters","Couplers","Reflector antennas","Slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CW radar","FM radar","Gunn oscillators","voltage-controlled oscillators","fin line components","waveguide couplers","reflector antennas","microstrip antenna arrays","slot antenna arrays","millimetre wave antenna arrays","road vehicle radar","millimetre wave receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FM/CW radar front-end","low-profile printed antenna","waveguide circuitry","low-loss antenna","Gunn voltage-controlled oscillator","finline mixer","E-plane couplers","folded reflector-type antenna","printed slot array","planar substrate","polarisation twisting","focusing","antenna beam scanning","77 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/808965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"A 77-GHz FM/CW radar front-end with a low-profile low-loss printed antenna","volume":"47","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6472180","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 77-GHz FM/CW radar front-end with a low-profile low-loss printed antenna","sourcePdf":"00808965.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037939S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"61","articleId":"808965","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":808967,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) is advantageously applied for simultaneous electrooptical upconversion of all optical channels carrying individual intermediate-frequency signals by means of a single external modulator. Thus, simple, but flexible, millimetric signal generation is obtained. Using this concept, data transmission experiments at 60 GHz have been carried out. Furthermore, the transponder noise performance is analyzed. Results of coded and uncoded 512-carrier orthogonal frequency division multiplex transmission with 50-Mb/s (subcarrier modulation quaternary phase-shift keying), 100 Mb/s (subcarrier modulation 16-quadrature amplitude modulation) as well as single-carrier modulation at 156 Mb/s utilizing three operational DWDM channels are presented. Uplink and downlink transmission has been realized. The significant performance improvement due to the application of coding is demonstrated in some experiments and line-of-sight transmission is compared to nonline-of-sight transmission. Low bit error rates, employing realistic air link conditions, have been obtained in all experiments.","doi":"10.1109/22.808967","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/17526/00808967.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.808967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17526","startPage":"2249","endPage":"2256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous electrooptical upconversion, remote oscillator generation, and air transmission of multiple optical WDM channels for a 60-GHz high-capacity indoor system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=808967","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous electrooptical upconversion, remote oscillator generation, and air transmission of multiple optical WDM channels for a 60-GHz high-capacity indoor system","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/808967/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6464154","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous electrooptical upconversion, remote oscillator generation, and air transmission of multiple optical WDM channels for a 60-GHz high-capacity indoor system","sourcePdf":"00808967.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043694S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"41","articleId":"808967","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":808968,"authors":[{"name":"M.-B.

Several new designs are presented for CPW open- and short-end shunt stubs patterned inside the center conductor. Unlike conventional stubs, which are patterned inside the ground plane, several advantages are derived from the use of the proposed framework: additional degrees of freedom, lower radiation loss, high compactness, and a reduction of the number of air bridges that are potentially expensive to build. The way to achieve high-quality circuits is detailed and confirmed by experimental results over the large frequency band from 1 to 50 GHz. Good agreement between experimental and theoretical results, obtained using two different full-wave techniques, validates the design procedure. In an effort to explore the advantages offered by the proposed CPW shunt stubs, in terms of their flexibility and potential for innovation, a possibility of the usage of such stubs in the area of filters is investigated. Thus, three novel variants of miniature filters are designed and measured, demonstrating that the proposed shunt stubs are entirely responsible for major reduction of size and better performance. The designs presented here show a new powerful way of achieving size, weight, and cost reduction. They are suitable for use as building blocks for the growing commercial radio-frequency/millimeter-waves wireless communications circuits and systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/808980/","volume":"47","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"6464166","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A useful new class of miniature CPW shunt stubs and its impact on millimeter-wave integrated circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A useful new class of miniature CPW shunt stubs and its impact on millimeter-wave integrated circuits","sourcePdf":"00808980.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053949S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"36","articleId":"808980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":808981,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The radial basis function (RBF) network is one approach which has shown a great promise in this sort of problems because of its faster learning capacity. A traditional RBF network takes Gaussian functions as its basis functions and adopts the least-squares criterion as the objective function, However, it still suffers from two major problems. First, it is difficult to use Gaussian functions to approximate constant values. If a function has nearly constant values in some intervals, the RBF network will be found inefficient in approximating these values. Second, when the training patterns incur a large error, the network will interpolate these training patterns incorrectly. In order to cope with these problems, an RBF network is proposed in this paper which is based on sequences of sigmoidal functions and a robust objective function. The former replaces the Gaussian functions as the basis function of the network so that constant-valued functions can be approximated accurately by an RBF network, while the latter is used to restrain the influence of large errors. Compared with traditional RBF networks, the proposed network demonstrates the following advantages: (1) better capability of approximation to underlying functions; (2) faster learning speed; (3) better size of network; (4) high robustness to outliers.","doi":"10.1109/3477.809023","startPage":"674","endPage":"685","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.809023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17525","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/17525/00809023.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust radial basis function neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809023/","displayDocTitle":"Robust radial basis function neural networks","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6454817","pubMedId":"18252348","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust radial basis function neural networks","sourcePdf":"00809023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045724S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"103","articleId":"809023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":809024,"authors":[{"name":"Ching-Chang Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Chang Wong","id":"37087313836"},{"name":"Chia-Chong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chia-Chong Chen","id":"37087314706"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"809024","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid clustering and gradient descent approach for fuzzy modeling","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/17525/00809024.pdf","startPage":"686","endPage":"693","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.809024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17525","doi":"10.1109/3477.809024","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Parameter estimation","Clustering algorithms","Fuzzy sets","Mathematical model","Clustering methods","Nonlinear systems","Inference algorithms","Uncertain systems","System identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","fuzzy logic","nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid clustering","gradient descent approach","fuzzy modeling","multi-input fuzzy model","input-output data","structure identification","parameter identification","nonlinear system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809024","abstract":"In this paper, a hybrid clustering and gradient descent approach is proposed for automatically constructing a multi-input fuzzy model where only the input-output data of the identified system are available.

In the process of parameter identification, the gradient descent method is used to tune the parameters of the constructed fuzzy model to obtain a more precise fuzzy model from the given input-output data. Finally, two examples of nonlinear system are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809024/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6454818","pubMedId":"18252349","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"29","issue":"6","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid clustering and gradient descent approach for fuzzy modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid clustering and gradient descent approach for fuzzy modeling","sourcePdf":"00809024.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036435S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"63","articleId":"809024","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809026,"authors":[{"name":"O.

Unfortunately, relatively few well-structured methodologies exist for designing and, in many cases, human experts are not able to express the knowledge needed to solve the problem in the form of fuzzy rules. Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy rule-based systems were enunciated in order to solve this design problem because they are usually identified using numerical data. In this paper we present a two-stage evolutionary process for designing TSK fuzzy rule-based systems from examples combining a generation stage based on a (/spl mu/, /spl lambda/)-evolution strategy, in which the fuzzy rules with different consequents compete among themselves to form part of a preliminary knowledge base, and a refinement stage in which both the antecedent and consequent parts of the fuzzy rules in this previous knowledge base are adapted by a hybrid evolutionary process composed of a genetic algorithm and an evolution strategy to obtain the final Knowledge base whose rules cooperate in the best possible way. Some aspects make this process different from others proposed until now: the design problem is addressed in two different stages, the use of an angular coding of the consequent parameters that allows us to search across the whole space of possible solutions, and the use of the available knowledge about the system under identification to generate the initial populations of the Evolutionary Algorithms that causes the search process to obtain good solutions more quickly. The performance of the method proposed is shown by solving two different problems: the fuzzy modeling of some three-dimensional surfaces and the computing of the maintenance costs of electrical medium line in Spanish towns. Results obtained are compared with other kind of techniques, evolutionary learning processes to design TSK and Mamdani-type fuzzy rule-based systems in the first case, and classical regression and neural modeling in the second.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809026/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6454820","pubMedId":"18252351","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A two-stage evolutionary process for designing TSK fuzzy rule-based systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-stage evolutionary process for designing TSK fuzzy rule-based systems","sourcePdf":"00809026.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035362S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"77","articleId":"809026","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":809027,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Liu","affiliation":["Systems Laboratory, Computer Science Division, Electro Technical Laboratory, Ibaraki, Japan"],"lastName":"Yong Liu","id":"37087154766"},{"name":"Xin Yao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, University of Binningham, Birmingham, UK"],"lastName":"Xin Yao","id":"37087181950"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4419"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0492"}],"articleNumber":"809027","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":198,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":439},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeesmc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809027","abstract":"This paper presents a new cooperative ensemble learning system (CELS) for designing neural network ensembles. The idea behind CELS is to encourage different individual networks in an ensemble to learn different parts or aspects of a training data so that the ensemble can learn the whole training data better. In CELS, the individual networks are trained simultaneously rather than independently or sequentially. This provides an opportunity for the individual networks to interact with each other and to specialize. CELS can create negatively correlated neural networks using a correlation penalty term in the error function to encourage such specialization. This paper analyzes CELS in terms of bias-variance-covariance tradeoff. CELS has also been tested on the Mackey-Glass time series prediction problem and the Australian credit card assessment problem. The experimental results show that CELS can produce neural network ensembles with good generalization ability.","doi":"10.1109/3477.809027","startPage":"716","endPage":"725","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/17525/00809027.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.809027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous training of negatively correlated neural networks in an ensemble","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intelligent networks","Training data","Learning systems","Laboratories","Computer science","Decorrelation","Testing","Australia","Credit cards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","generalisation (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous training","negatively correlated neural networks","ensemble","cooperative ensemble learning system","training data","correlation penalty term","error function","bias-variance-covariance tradeoff","Mackey-Glass time series prediction problem","Australian credit card assessment problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809027/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous training of negatively correlated neural networks in an ensemble","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6454821","pubMedId":"18252352","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous training of negatively correlated neural networks in an ensemble","sourcePdf":"00809027.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030472S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"198","articleId":"809027","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":809032,"authors":[{"name":"A.

From this discussion an equivalence between the concepts of fuzzy clustering and soft competitive learning in clustering algorithms is proposed as a unifying framework in the comparison of clustering systems. Moreover, a set of functional attributes is selected for use as dictionary entries in the comparison of clustering algorithms, which is the subject of part II of this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/17525/00809032.pdf","startPage":"778","endPage":"785","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/3477.809032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.809032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey of fuzzy clustering algorithms for pattern recognition.

Flexibility, and consistency are essential for fuzzy systems to exhibit an excellent performance and to have a clear physical meaning, while compactness is crucial when the number of the input variables increases. However, the completeness and consistency conditions are often violated if a fuzzy system is generated from data collected from real world applications. A systematic design paradigm is proposed using evolution strategies. The structure of the fuzzy rules, which determines the compactness of the fuzzy systems, is evolved along with the parameters of the fuzzy systems. Special attention has been paid to the completeness and consistency of the rule base. The completeness is guaranteed by checking the completeness of the fuzzy partitioning of input variables and the completeness of the rule structure. An index of inconsistency is suggested with the help of a fuzzy similarity which can prevent the algorithm from generating rules that seriously contradict with each other or with the heuristic knowledge. In addition, soft T-norm and BADD defuzzification are introduced and optimized to increase the flexibility of the fuzzy system. The proposed approach is applied to the design of a distance controller for cars. It is verified that a FC/sup 3/ fuzzy system works very well both, for training and test driving situations, especially when the training data are insufficient.","doi":"10.1109/3477.809036","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","startPage":"829","endPage":"845","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/17525/00809036.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3477.809036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On generating FC/sup 3/ fuzzy rule systems from data using evolution strategies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Input variables","Control system synthesis","Nonlinear control systems","Control nonlinearities","Fuzzy control","Genetic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Partitioning algorithms","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy systems","evolutionary computation","heuristic programming","automated highways","fuzzy control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy rule systems","evolution strategies","performance","fuzzy partitioning","fuzzy similarity","heuristic knowledge","car distance controller","BADD defuzzification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"On generating FC/sup 3/ fuzzy rule systems from data using evolution strategies","volume":"29","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6454827","pubMedId":"18252361","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809036/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On generating FC/sup 3/ fuzzy rule systems from data using evolution strategies","sourcePdf":"00809036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077102S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"141","articleId":"809036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809038,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Microgears are electrodeposited from a mixed nickel sulfanate/iron chloride electrolyte through a 230-/spl mu/m-thick poly methylmethacrylate mold patterned using synchrotron X-ray radiation. Despite the use of a plating cell with nearly ideal wafer-scale electrolyte mixing characteristics [the uniform injection cell (UIC)], a degree of compositional variation in the microgears can arise. The composition variation is shown to be due primarily to nonuniformities in microscopic electrolyte mixing patterns within the mold. To a lesser extent, nonuniformity in the local current distribution also contributes to feature-scale composition variation. Improved composition uniformity is achieved when the plating bath is formulated to reduce the sensitivity to electrolyte agitation. Electrodeposition of MEMS components from a low-flow sensitivity electrolyte using the UIC results in NiFe growth rates greater than 60 /spl mu/m/h, yields in excess of 90% and good compositional uniformity. Analysis of mechanical properties illustrates that NiFe parts made using this technique compare favorably to typical electrodeposited MEMS components made from nickel and copper.","doi":"10.1109/84.809052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.809052","endPage":"392","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/17524/00809052.pdf","startPage":"384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-rate through-mold electrodeposition of thick (>200 /spl mu/m) NiFe MEMS components with uniform composition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809052/","displayDocTitle":"High-rate through-mold electrodeposition of thick (>200 /spl mu/m) NiFe MEMS components with uniform composition","volume":"8","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6458367","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-rate through-mold electrodeposition of thick (>200 /spl mu/m) NiFe MEMS components with uniform composition","sourcePdf":"00809052.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054492S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"41","articleId":"809052","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809057,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The buckling depends weakly on Poisson's ratio and essentially is a function of the reduced prestrain, /spl epsi/~/sub 0/=/spl epsi//sub 0/a/sup 2//h/sup 2/, where /spl epsi//sub 0/ is the physical prestrain, a is the width, and h is the thickness of the membrane. As /spl epsi/~/sub 0/ becomes increasingly negative, the membrane undergoes two symmetry breaking buckling transitions. Beyond the first transition occurring at /spl epsi/~/sub cr1/, the buckling profile has all the reflection and rotation symmetries of a square. The reflection symmetries are lost through a second instability transition at /spl epsi/~/sub cr2/. The bifurcation points, /spl epsi/~/sub cr1/ and /spl epsi/~/sub cr2/, and buckling profiles were calculated using analytical energy minimization and nonlinear finite-element simulation. Both methods agree. The buckling of micromachined plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition silicon nitride membranes on a silicon wafer is interpreted in terms of the theoretical results. Good matching between measured and calculated buckling profiles is found. The extracted strain values are consistent irrespective of the size and buckling mode of the membranes. From the average strain across the wafer /spl epsi//sub 0/=-3.50/spl times/10/sup -4/ and complementary wafer curvature measurements, a Young's modulus of 130 GPa is deduced. Methods for the straightforward extraction of /spl epsi//sub 0/ from experimental center deflections of buckled square membranes are described.","doi":"10.1109/84.809057","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/17524/00809057.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.809057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strongly buckled square micromachined membranes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809057/","displayDocTitle":"Strongly buckled square micromachined membranes","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6458371","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strongly buckled square micromachined membranes","sourcePdf":"00809057.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059585S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"62","articleId":"809057","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":809058,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The method uses video imaging under continuous illumination to effectively remove the upper limit imposed by other methods on the frequency of motions that can be measured. It can be used to measure the motions of any visible structure, whether or not an electrical or optical sensor for that motion has been incorporated. The magnitude of the displacement of a target, such as the edge of a sinusoidally vibrating shuttle mass, is obtained from a single frame of video taken during motion plus a reference frame taken when the target is at rest. The speed of this technique facilitates hands-on testing of prototypes and is especially attractive for production environments. An automated MEMS microresonator testbed is described that performs on-line resonance curve parameter extractions of resonant frequency (f/sub 0/) and quality factor (Q) from electrical measurements, which are derived from output comb-drive current measurements using established methods, and from simultaneous optical measurements using the new method. Results obtained using these methods for design evaluation of microfabricated lateral resonators are discussed, and favorable benchmark comparisons of the optical results with results from a MEMS testbed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6458377","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A system for automatic electrical and optical characterization of microelectromechanical devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A system for automatic electrical and optical characterization of microelectromechanical devices","sourcePdf":"00809063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049067S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"48","articleId":"809063","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809065,"authors":[{"name":"E.S.

A design example where axial forces exerted by the piezoelectric layer are important is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809069/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","volume":"8","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6458382","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Working equations for piezoelectric actuators and sensors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Working equations for piezoelectric actuators and sensors","sourcePdf":"00809069.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027247S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"178","articleId":"809069","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":809073,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

An important advantage of the method over the existing iterative inversion algorithm is that various designated network inversions of multilayer perceptrons and radial basis function neural networks can be obtained by solving the corresponding SP problems, which can be solved by a modified simplex method. We present several examples to demonstrate the proposed method and applications of network inversions to examine and improve the generalization performance of trained networks.

However, if the network learns the new patterns only by referring to them, it probably forgets old memorized patterns, since parameters in the network usually correlate not only to the old memories but also to the new patterns. A certain way to avoid the loss of memories is to learn the new patterns with all memorized patterns. It needs, however, a large computational power. To solve this problem, we propose incremental learning methods with retrieval of interfered patterns (ILRI). In these methods, the system employs a modified version of a resource allocating network (RAN) which is one variation of a generalized radial basis function (GRBF). In ILRI, the RAN learns new patterns with a relearning of a few number of retrieved past patterns that are interfered with the incremental learning. We construct ILRI in two steps. In the first step, we construct a system which searches the interfered patterns from past input patterns stored in a database.

The simulation results show that these two systems have almost the same ability, and the generalization ability is higher than other similar systems using neural networks and k-nearest neighbors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental learning methods with retrieving of interfered patterns","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.809080","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/17523/00809080.pdf","startPage":"1351","endPage":"1365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.809080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17523","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809080/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Incremental learning methods with retrieving of interfered patterns","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6465805","pubMedId":"18252636","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental learning methods with retrieving of interfered patterns","sourcePdf":"00809080.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07165S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"75","articleId":"809080","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809081,"authors":[{"name":"Jyh-Ching Juang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jyh-Ching Juang","id":"37087173260"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"809081","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Neural networks","Hopfield neural networks","Linear matrix inequalities","Robust stability","Robust control","Lyapunov method","Symmetric matrices","Stability criteria","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust control","Hopfield neural nets","Lyapunov methods","Popov criterion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability analysis","Hopfield-type neural networks","robust control research","linear matrix inequalities","edge theorem","parameter-dependent Lyapunov function","Popov criteria","existence","uniqueness","matrix determinant problem","induction scheme","global stability","local stability"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809081","abstract":"The paper applies several concepts in robust control research such as linear matrix inequalities, edge theorem, parameter-dependent Lyapunov function, and Popov criteria to investigate the stability property of Hopfield-type neural networks.

More specifically, multilayer feedforward neural networks were used to evaluate alternative board positions and games were played using a minimax search strategy. At each generation, the extant neural networks were paired in competitions and selection was used to eliminate those that performed poorly relative to other networks. Offspring neural networks were created from the survivors using random variation of all weights and bias terms. After a series of 250 generations, the best-evolved neural network was played against human opponents in a series of 90 games on an Internet website. The neural network was able to defeat two expert-level players and played to a draw against a master. The final rating of the neural network placed it in the \"Class A\" category using a standard rating system. Of particular importance in the design of the experiment was the fact that no features beyond the piece differential were given to the neural networks as a priori knowledge. The process of evolution was able to extract all of the additional information required to play at this level of competency. It accomplished this based almost solely on the feedback offered in the final aggregated outcome of each game played (i.e., win, lose, or draw). This procedure stands in marked contrast to the typical artifice of explicitly injecting expert knowledge into a game-playing program.","doi":"10.1109/72.809083","startPage":"1382","endPage":"1391","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/17523/00809083.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.809083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving neural networks to play checkers without relying on expert knowledge","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Humans","Evolutionary computation","Multi-layer neural network","Feedforward neural networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Minimax techniques","IP networks","Data mining","Neurofeedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","multilayer perceptrons","games of skill","search problems","minimax techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["checkers","evolving population","multilayer feedforward neural networks","minimax search strategy","offspring neural networks","expert-level players","standard rating system","aggregated outcome","game-playing program"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809083/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Evolving neural networks to play checkers without relying on expert knowledge","volume":"10","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6465808","pubMedId":"18252639","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving neural networks to play checkers without relying on expert knowledge","sourcePdf":"00809083.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047526S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"121","articleId":"809083","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":809084,"authors":[{"name":"G.P.J.

This significantly limits the applicability of neural networks in practice, especially where a premium is placed on the comprehensibility or reliability of systems. A novel artificial neural-network decision tree algorithm (ANN-DT) is therefore proposed, which extracts binary decision trees from a trained neural network. The ANN-DT algorithm uses the neural network to generate outputs for samples interpolated from the training data set. In contrast to existing techniques, ANN-DT can extract rules from feedforward neural networks with continuous outputs. These rules are extracted from the neural network without making assumptions about the internal structure of the neural network or the features of the data. A novel attribute selection criterion based on a significance analysis of the variables on the neural-network output is examined. It is shown to have significant benefits in certain cases when compared with the standard criteria of minimum weighted variance over the branches. In three case studies the ANN-DT algorithm compared favorably with CART, a standard decision tree algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/72.809084","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/17523/00809084.pdf","startPage":"1392","endPage":"1401","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.809084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ANN-DT: an algorithm for extraction of decision trees from artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","displayDocTitle":"ANN-DT: an algorithm for extraction of decision trees from artificial neural networks","volume":"10","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6465809","pubMedId":"18252640","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ANN-DT: an algorithm for extraction of decision trees from artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00809084.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04132S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"78","articleId":"809084","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":809085,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

The corresponding number of nested modules needed for a certain prediction task, and their contribution toward the final prediction gain give a thorough insight into the way the PRNN performs, and offers solutions for optimization of its parameters. In particular, nesting allows the forgetting factor in the cost function of the PRNN to exceed unity, hence it becomes an emphasis factor. This compensates for the small contribution of the distant modules to the prediction process, due to nesting, and helps to circumvent the problem of vanishing gradient, experienced in RNNs for prediction. The PRNN is shown to outperform the linear least mean square and recursive least squares predictors, as well as previously proposed PRNN schemes, at no expense of additional computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809088/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6465813","pubMedId":"18252644","volume":"10","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Toward an optimal PRNN-based nonlinear predictor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward an optimal PRNN-based nonlinear predictor","sourcePdf":"00809088.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034996S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"25","articleId":"809088","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":809089,"authors":[{"name":"Junhong Nie","affiliation":["Communications Research Laboratory, McMaster University, Hamilton, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Junhong Nie","id":"37087217390"},{"name":"S.

This paper presents a novel approach to solving the dynamic channel assignment (DCA) problem by using a form of real-time reinforcement learning known as Q-learning in conjunction with neural network representation. Instead of relying on a known teacher the system is designed to learn an optimal channel assignment policy by directly interacting with the mobile communication environment. The performance of the Q-learning based DCA was examined by extensive simulation studies on a 49-cell mobile communication system under various conditions. Comparative studies with the fixed channel assignment (FCA) scheme and one of the best dynamic channel assignment strategies, MAXAVAIL, have revealed that the proposed approach is able to perform better than the FCA in various situations and capable of achieving a performance similar to that achieved by the MAXAVAIL, but with a significantly reduced computational complexity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809089/","volume":"10","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6465814","pubMedId":"18252645","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic channel assignment policy through Q-learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic channel assignment policy through Q-learning","sourcePdf":"00809089.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03799S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"51","articleId":"809089","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":809090,"authors":[{"name":"P.J.

For both issues the case of predicting the probability that paper will be \"out-of-specification\" and that of predicting the level of curl, we include confidence intervals indicating to the machine operator whether the predictions should be trusted.

Because sample selection is viewed as a hard computational problem, this selection is done after a previous vector quantization: this way obtains also other similar machines using centroids selected from those that are learned in a supervised manner. Several forms of designing these machines are considered, in particular with respect to sample selection; as well as some different criteria to train them. Simulation results for well-known classification problems show very good performance of the corresponding designs, improving that of support vector machines and reducing substantially their number of units. This shows that our interest in selecting samples (or centroids) in an efficient manner is justified. Many new research avenues appear from these experiments and discussions, as suggested in our conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/72.809092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.809092","startPage":"1474","endPage":"1481","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/17523/00809092.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sample selection via clustering to construct support vector-like classifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Sample selection via clustering to construct support vector-like classifiers","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"10","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6465817","pubMedId":"18252648","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809092/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sample selection via clustering to construct support vector-like classifiers","sourcePdf":"00809092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039734S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"51","articleId":"809092","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":809094,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Yi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Yi","id":"37087216814"},{"name":"P.A.

We provide a solution to the problem of matching two trees by constructing the association graph using the graph-theoretic concept of connectivity. We prove that, in the new formulation, there is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal cliques and maximal subtree isomorphisms. This allows us to cast the tree matching problem as an indefinite quadratic program using the Motzkin-Straus theorem, and we use \"replicator\" dynamical systems developed in theoretical biology to solve it. Such continuous solutions to discrete problems are attractive because they can motivate analog and biological implementations. The framework is also extended to the matching of attributed trees by using weighted association graphs. We illustrate the power of the approach by matching articulated and deformed shapes described by shock trees.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tree graphs","Computer vision","Computer science","Shape","Electric shock","Mathematics","Machine intelligence","Systems biology","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trees (mathematics)","optimisation","computer vision","pattern matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical structures","association graphs","relational structures","maximal clique","computer vision problems","connectivity","maximal subtree isomorphisms","tree matching problem","indefinite quadratic program","Motzkin-Straus theorem","replicator dynamical systems","attributed trees","weighted graphs","deformed shapes","articulated shapes","shock trees"]}],"doi":"10.1109/34.809105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/17522/00809105.pdf","startPage":"1105","endPage":"1120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.809105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching hierarchical structures using association graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Matching hierarchical structures using association graphs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809105/","volume":"21","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6456379","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching hierarchical structures using association graphs","sourcePdf":"00809105.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074811S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"276","articleId":"809105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":809116,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Magnetic time effects become more pronounced as the volume of the switching unit becomes smaller, and thus become of more practical importance as the microstructure of recording media is made finer in the pursuit of greater information storage density. Magnetic time effects taking place on time scales longer than about 10/sup -9/ s can be explained by a model of thermally assisted crossing of an energy barrier (Arrhenius-Neel formalism). Many recording phenomena can be explained within this regime. Observation of magnetization changes during exposure to a constant field (\"magnetic viscosity\") can be interpreted to yield an estimate of the switching volume; in most cases, this volume is larger than the frequently cited \"activation volume\". The dependence of coercivity on the time scale of the magnetic reversal precess (e.g., on the field sweep rate of a hysteresis loop) can also be used to deduce the volume of the switching unit and to estimate time effects relevant to information storage. A model and procedure for analysis of time-scale dependence of coercivity are described here and applied to typical advanced tape media, of both metal particulate (MP) and metal-evaporated (ME) composition. The resulting switching volume for the MP tape (where the microstructure is well defined) is in approximate agreement with the particle size seen by electron microscopy. The magnetic time effects are significantly stronger in the ME tape than in the MP tape. Measurement of coercivity ion at least two very different time scales (e.g., by vibrating-sample magnetometer and 60-Hz hysteresis loops) provides a convenient means of estimating the effective switching-unit volume, and hence the magnitude of the time effects to be expected in a recording application. The model also allows the estimation of the minimum particle or grain sizes that could be used with adequate stability of magnetic transitions in high-density information storage. The practical lower limit for metal-particle volume is found to be about one-fifth to one-fourth of the volume of current advanced particles.","doi":"10.1109/20.809133","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17529/00809133.pdf","startPage":"4414","endPage":"4422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.809133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement and interpretation of magnetic time effects in recording media","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Measurement and interpretation of magnetic time effects in recording media","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6456243","volume":"35","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement and interpretation of magnetic time effects in recording media","sourcePdf":"00809133.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044867S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"76","articleId":"809133","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":809134,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Continued scaling to smaller bit and grain sizes, however, may prompt spontaneous magnetization reversal processes when the stored energy per particle starts competing with thermal energy, thereby limiting the achievable areal density. Charap et al. have predicted this to occur at about 40 Gbits/in/sup 2/. This paper discusses thermal effects in the framework of basic Arrhenius-Neel statistical switching models. It is emphasized that magnetization decay is intimately related to high-speed-switching phenomena. Thickness-, temperature- and bit-density dependent recording experiments reveal the onset of thermal decay at \"stability ratios\" (K/sub u/V/K/sub B/T)/sub 0//spl sime/35 /spl plusmn/ 2. The stability requirement is grain size dispersion dependent and shifts to about 60 for projected 40 Gbits/in/sup 2/ conditions and ten-year storage times. Higher anisotropy and coercivity media with reduced grain sizes are logical extensions of the current technology until write field limitations are reached. Future advancements will rely on deviations from traditional scaling. Squarer bits may reduce destabilizing stray fields inside the bit transitions. Perpendicular recording may shift the onset of thermal effects to higher bit densities. Enhanced signal processing may allow signal retrieval with fewer grains per bit. Finally, single grain per bit recording may be envisioned in patterned media, with lithographically defined bits.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17529/00809134.pdf","startPage":"4423","endPage":"4439","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.809134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.809134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal effect limits in ultrahigh-density magnetic recording","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic recording","Grain size","Signal processing","Magnetic noise","Couplings","Magnetization reversal","Limiting","Stability","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Coercive force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic recording","magnetocaloric effects","grain size","magnetisation reversal","magnetic switching","coercive force","magnetic anisotropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal effect","ultrahigh-density magnetic recording","longitudinal recording","areal density","noise","statistical averaging","ferromagnetic grain size","bit size","spontaneous magnetization reversal","Arrhenius-Neel model","high-speed switching","stability ratio","anisotropy","dynamic coercivity","perpendicular recording","signal decay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Thermal effect limits in ultrahigh-density magnetic recording","volume":"35","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6456244","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermal effect limits in ultrahigh-density magnetic recording","sourcePdf":"00809134.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.233789S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"1043","articleId":"809134","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":809137,"authors":[{"name":"T.I.

Finally, the paper compares predictions of the unaligned inductance computed by the analytical model to those obtained by finite-element analysis for three different machines with different pole counts and rotor diameters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical calculation of the switched reluctance motor's unaligned inductance","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.809140","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17529/00809140.pdf","startPage":"4473","endPage":"4481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.809140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809140/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Analytical calculation of the switched reluctance motor's unaligned inductance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6456250","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical calculation of the switched reluctance motor's unaligned inductance","sourcePdf":"00809140.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041606S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"96","articleId":"809140","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809141,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Casemore","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, College of Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Casemore","id":"37444979300"},{"name":"L.S.

Typically, self-bearing motor designs use toothed stators to provide minimum reluctance flux paths that create the magnetic bearing forces necessary to support the rotor. These toothed designs can have significant cogging torque, rendering them ineffective for smooth torque applications such as those found in aerospace. A toothless permanent-magnet self-bearing motor can provide smooth torque production and adequate bearing force for low-gravity environments. Characterization of the open-loop gains for this actuator is necessary for linear controller development. In this paper simple algebraic equations are derived for the motoring and bearing current gains, and an analytical method is presented for computing the negative stiffness. The analytical method solves the Dirichlet boundary value problem (BVP) in the eccentric annulus for the magnetomotive force (MMF) in the air gap subject to harmonic boundary conditions. A conformal transformation to bipolar coordinates is used, yielding a BVP that is solvable by separation of variables. Expressions for the flux density, Maxwell force on the rotor, and the negative stiffness in terms of the MMF are presented. A sample problem is presented that illustrates the flux distribution in the air gap and the operating principals of this actuator type.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/17529/00809141.pdf","startPage":"4482","endPage":"4489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.809141","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.809141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Actuator gains for a toothless permanent-magnet self-bearing motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Permanent magnet motors","Reluctance motors","Magnetic levitation","Torque","Magnetic separation","Magnetic flux","Magnetic analysis","Stators","Rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["permanent magnet motors","torque","electromagnetic actuators","machine bearings","stators","machine theory","boundary-value problems","rotors","magnetic flux"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["toothless permanent-magnet self-bearing motor","single magnetic actuator","smooth torque production","bearing force","low-gravity environments","open-loop gains","linear controller development","algebraic equations","negative stiffness","Dirichlet boundary value problem","magnetomotive force","harmonic boundary conditions","conformal transformation","bipolar coordinates","flux density","Maxwell force","flux distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Actuator gains for a toothless permanent-magnet self-bearing motor","volume":"35","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6456251","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Actuator gains for a toothless permanent-magnet self-bearing motor","sourcePdf":"00809141.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077089S","chronDate":"Nov.  1999","isNumber":"17529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"13","articleId":"809141","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809146,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Lin","affiliation":["Philips Semiconductors, Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Bin Lin","id":"37438282400"},{"name":"K.E.

The review is structured around the strategies used by the algorithms (transition based or homogeneity based) and the decision spaces (spatial, spatio-temporal, and temporal).

This strategy tries to find a compromise between what can be done in a systematic and universal way and what has to be application dependent. It is shown in particular how a single partition tree created with an extremely simple similarity feature can support a large number of segmentation applications: spatial segmentation, motion estimation, region-based coding, semantic object extraction, and region-based retrieval.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Region-based representations of image and video: segmentation tools for multimedia services","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.809153","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/17530/00809153.pdf","startPage":"1147","endPage":"1169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.809153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17530","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809153","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Region-based representations of image and video: segmentation tools for multimedia services","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6458273","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Region-based representations of image and video: segmentation tools for multimedia services","sourcePdf":"00809153.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053434S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"160","articleId":"809153","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809155,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This requires a prior decomposition of sequences into semantically meaningful, physical objects. We formulate this problem as one of separating foreground objects from the background based on motion information. For the object of interest, a 2D binary model is derived and tracked throughout the sequence. The model points consist of edge pixels detected by the Canny operator. To accommodate rotation and changes in shape of the tracked object, the model is updated every frame. These binary models then guide the actual video object plane (VOP) extraction. Thanks to our new boundary postprocessor and the excellent edge localization properties of the Canny operator, the resulting VOP contours are very accurate. Both the model initialization and update stages exploit motion information. The main assumption underlying our approach is the existence of a dominant global motion that can be assigned to the background. Areas that do not follow this background motion indicate the presence of independently moving physical objects. Two alternative methods to identify such objects are presented. The first one employs a morphological motion filter with a new filter criterion, which measures the deviation of the locally estimated optical flow from the corresponding global motion. The second method computes a change detection mask by taking the difference between consecutive frames. The first version is more suitable for sequences with little motion, whereas the second version is better at dealing with faster moving or changing objects. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of our algorithm.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/17530/00809155.pdf","startPage":"1190","endPage":"1203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video segmentation for content-based coding","doi":"10.1109/76.809155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.809155","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809155/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Video segmentation for content-based coding","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6458275","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video segmentation for content-based coding","sourcePdf":"00809155.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03892S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"143","articleId":"809155","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809157,"authors":[{"name":"Munchurl Kim","affiliation":["Broadcasting Technology Department, Radio and Broadcasting Technology Laboratory, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Munchurl Kim","id":"37366293900"},{"name":"Jae Gark Choi","affiliation":["Kyungil University, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae Gark Choi","id":"38150797000"},{"name":"Daehee Kim","affiliation":["Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Kwangju, South Korea"],"lastName":"Daehee Kim","id":"37440286500"},{"name":"Hyung Lee","affiliation":["Broadcasting Technology Department, Radio and Broadcasting Technology Laboratory, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyung Lee","id":"38255720900"},{"name":"Myoung Ho Lee","affiliation":["Broadcasting Technology Department, Radio and Broadcasting Technology Laboratory, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Myoung Ho Lee","id":"38256740600"},{"name":"Chieteuk Ahn","affiliation":["Broadcasting Technology Department, Radio and Broadcasting Technology Laboratory, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chieteuk Ahn","id":"37286767900"},{"name":"Yo-Sung Ho","affiliation":["Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Kwangju, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yo-Sung Ho","id":"37289814300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"809157","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":91,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":520},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Image sequences","MPEG 4 Standard","Video sequences","Encoding","Performance evaluation","Radio broadcasting","Broadcast technology","Video coding","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","image sequences","code standards","image segmentation","image motion analysis","telecommunication standards","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VOP generation tool","automatic segmentation","moving objects","image sequences","spatio-temporal information","MPEG-4 video coding standard","MPEG-4 visual standard","video sequences","video object planes","frame representation","still pictures","image segmentation","image frames","temporal direction","hypothesis testing","variance estimates","difference images","F-test","spatial segmentation","semantic regions","object boundaries","temporal segmentation","change detection mask","background","moving areas","nonmoving areas","foreground","experimental results"]}],"abstract":"The new MPEG-4 video coding standard enables content-based functionalities. In order to support the philosophy of the MPEG-4 visual standard, each frame of video sequences should be represented in terms of video object planes (VOPs).

Therefore, it requires a prior decomposition of sequences into VOPs so that each VOP represents a moving object. This paper addresses an image segmentation method for separating moving objects from the background in image sequences. The proposed method utilizes the following spatio-temporal information. (1) For localization of moving objects in the image sequence, two consecutive image frames in the temporal direction are examined and a hypothesis testing is performed by comparing two variance estimates from two consecutive difference images, which results in an F-test. (2) Spatial segmentation is performed to divide each image into semantic regions and to find precise object boundaries of the moving objects. The temporal segmentation yields a change detection mask that indicates moving areas (foreground) and nonmoving areas (background), and spatial segmentation produces spatial segmentation masks. A combination of the spatial and temporal segmentation masks produces VOPs faithfully.

The estimated motion parameters describe the continuous and time-consistent motion over the whole sequence relatively to a fixed reference coordinate system. The proposed method is suitable for the estimation of affine motion parameters as well as for higher order motion models like the parabolic model-combining the advantages of feature matching and optical flow techniques. A hierarchical strategy is applied for the estimation, first translation, affine motion, and finally higher order motion parameters, which is robust and computationally efficient. A closed-loop prediction scheme is applied to avoid the problem of error accumulation in long-term motion estimation. The presented results indicate that the proposed technique is a very accurate and robust approach for long-term global motion estimation, which can be used for applications such as MPEG-4 sprite coding or MPEG-7 motion description. We also show that the efficiency of global motion estimation can be significantly increased if a higher order motion model is applied, and we present a new sprite coding scheme for on-line applications. We further demonstrate that the proposed estimator serves as a powerful tool for segmentation of video sequences.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/17530/00809158.pdf","startPage":"1227","endPage":"1242","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.809158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.809158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17530","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Long-term global motion estimation and its application for sprite coding, content description, and segmentation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Sprites (computer)","MPEG 4 Standard","Image segmentation","Image coding","MPEG 7 Standard","Predictive models","Parameter estimation","Robustness","Motion compensation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","image sequences","video coding","code standards","telecommunication standards","data compression","image segmentation","image representation","prediction theory","feature extraction","image matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long-term global motion estimation","content description","image segmentation","image objects","estimated motion parameters","continuous motion","time-consistent motion","affine motion parameters","higher order motion models","parabolic model","feature matching","optical flow techniques","translation","closed-loop prediction","MPEG-4 sprite coding","MPEG-7 motion description","higher order motion model","on-line applications","video sequences","object-based representation","video compression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809158/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Long-term global motion estimation and its application for sprite coding, content description, and segmentation","volume":"9","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6458278","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Long-term global motion estimation and its application for sprite coding, content description, and segmentation","sourcePdf":"00809158.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053193S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"104","articleId":"809158","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":809161,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun Sung Chang","affiliation":["Radio & Broadcasting Technology Laboratory, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyun Sung Chang","id":"37087347215"},{"name":"Sanghoon Sull","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sanghoon Sull","id":"37087259949"},{"name":"Sang Uk Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sang Uk Lee","id":"37087145007"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"809161","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":152,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":755},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexing","Content based retrieval","Information retrieval","Databases","Video sequences","Data mining","Cameras","Internet","Software libraries","Gunshot detection systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video databases","database indexing","content-based retrieval","set theory","image representation","feature extraction","image sequences","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video indexing scheme","content-based retrieval","browsing","video databases","key frame extraction problem","set-theory","systematic algorithms","video segment","fidelity","tree-structured key frame hierarchy","multilevel abstract","depth-first search scheme","pruning","video sequences"]}],"abstract":"Extracting a small number of key frames that can abstract the content of video is very important for efficient browsing and retrieval in video databases.

In osteoporosis, bone mass gradually decreases until the skeleton is too fragile to support the body and a fracture occurs, typically in the femur, wrist or spine. In osteoarthritis, there is a proliferation of bone, leading to a stiffening of the tissue. Current clinical methods for assessment of bone changes in these disorders largely depend on assessing bone mineral density. However, this does not provide any information about bone structure, which is considered to be an equally important factor in assessing bone quality. This paper presents a novel approach for computer analysis of trabecular (or cancellous) bone structure. The technique uses a Fourier transform to generate a \"spectral fingerprint\" of an image. Principal components analysis is then applied to identify key features from the Fourier transform and this information is passed to a neural network for classification. Testing this on a series of 100 histological sections of trabecular bone from patients with OP and OA and a normal group correctly classified over 90% of the OP group with an overall accuracy of 77%-84%. Such high success rates on a small group suggest that this may provide a simple, but powerful, method for identifying alterations in bone structure.","doi":"10.1109/4233.809173","startPage":"289","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4233.809173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17531","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233/17531/00809173.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of trabecular bone structure using Fourier transforms and neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809173/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of trabecular bone structure using Fourier transforms and neural networks","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6463580","pubMedId":"10719479","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of trabecular bone structure using Fourier transforms and neural networks","sourcePdf":"00809173.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0409S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"33","articleId":"809173","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":809176,"authors":[{"name":"Chang-Hsing Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Chinese Cultural University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chang-Hsing Lee","id":"37087374355"},{"name":"Yeuan-Kuen Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Science, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yeuan-Kuen Lee","id":"37087852170"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"809176","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":485},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"abstract":"An adaptive digital image watermarking technique is proposed.

Statistical characteristics of the delay spread, frequency response and noise can be extracted from the data and used in the design of AC power line based communications systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide band AC power line characterization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.809186","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/17557/00809186.pdf","startPage":"1087","endPage":"1097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.809186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809186/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Wide band AC power line characterization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2003","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6464347","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide band AC power line characterization","sourcePdf":"00809186.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02814S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"91","articleId":"809186","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":809188,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

The performance analysis has been demonstrated for each case, respectively. The results indicate the optical CDMA is not suitable for this application and the WDMA scheme can be combined with the SCMA or TDMA scheme in such a application to enhance the system capacity. Finally, from the viewpoint of the system capacity extension and design flexibility, we show that the SCMA scheme is superior to the TDMA scheme in terms of higher cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/17557/00809198.pdf","startPage":"1159","endPage":"1168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.809198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.809198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feasibility study of airplane fiber optical communication network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber communication","Airplanes","Optical fiber networks","Time division multiple access","Multiaccess communication","Aerospace electronics","Aircraft","Code division multiplexing","Frequency division multiplexing","WDM networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","optical fibre networks","optical links","code division multiple access","time division multiple access","wavelength division multiplexing","subcarrier multiplexing","entertainment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airplane fiber optical communication network","in-flight entertainment system","aircraft infrastructure","ARINC Specification 628 Part 4","optical multiplexing schemes","time-division-multiple access","TDMA","sub-carrier multiple access","SCMA","wavelength/frequency-division multiple access","WDMA/FDMA","code-division multiple access","CDMA","optical links","cabin electronics compartment","area distribution box","performance analysis","system capacity extension","cost","WDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809198/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"Feasibility study of airplane fiber optical communication network","volume":"45","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6464356","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2003","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feasibility study of airplane fiber optical communication network","sourcePdf":"00809198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053428S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","articleId":"809198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":809217,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Hahk Lee","affiliation":["Central Res. & Dev.

The modem is based on NTT DoCoMo's proposal for the next generation W-CDMA air interface. The modulator supports multicode transmission capability, which enables three dedicated physical channels to be transmitted under a single radio link identification. The receiver consists of a searcher, three fingers and combiner and each finger can demodulate three dedicated physical channels simultaneously. For coherent QPSK data demodulation, a novel phase estimation algorithm has been employed. In this algorithm, a finger selects the minimum value after comparing four phase prediction values to the previous one to compute the correct phase. It has been shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the WMSA proposed by NTT DoCoMo. The proposed mobile station modem was implemented with FPGAs and verified by the board-level experiment. Experiments have verified that the modem fully complies with the specification and is capable of up to 384 kbps data transmission when using multicode transmission.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A wideband DS-CDMA modem for a mobile station","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.809217","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/17557/00809217.pdf","startPage":"1259","endPage":"1269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.809217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17557","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","displayDocTitle":"A wideband DS-CDMA modem for a mobile station","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2003","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6464369","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A wideband DS-CDMA modem for a mobile station","sourcePdf":"809217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054989S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"7","articleId":"809217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":809230,"authors":[{"name":"M.

To produce a visually perceptible difference in graphics applications, Intel's 32-bit processors-based on the IA-32 architecture-required an increase of 1.5 to 2 times the native floating-point performance. One path to better performance involves studying how the system uses data. Today's 3D applications can execute a lot faster by differentiating between data used repeatedly and streaming data-data used only once and then discarded. The Pentium III's new floating-point extension lets programmers designate data as streaming and provides instructions that handle this data efficiently.

In the immediate future, the authors anticipate collecting data at the rate of terabytes per day from many classes of applications, including simulations running on teraFLOPS-class computers and experimental data produced by increasingly more sensitive and accurate instruments, such as telescopes, microscopes, particle accelerators and satellites. Generating or acquiring data is not an end in itself but a vehicle for obtaining insights. While data analysis and reduction have a role to play, in many situations we achieve understanding only when a human being interprets the data. Visualization has emerged as an important tool for extracting meaning from the large volumes of data that scientific instruments and simulations produce. The authors describe an online system that supports 3D tomographic image reconstruction-and subsequent collaborative analysis-of data from remote scientific instruments.","doi":"10.1109/2.809249","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","startPage":"36","endPage":"43","publicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel5/2/17554/00809249.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.809249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distance visualization: data exploration on the grid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Instruments","Data analysis","Application software","Computational modeling","Computer simulation","Telescopes","Microscopy","Linear particle accelerator","Satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","data acquisition","digital simulation","natural sciences computing","computerised tomography","image reconstruction","data analysis","data reduction","groupware","online operation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distance visualization","data exploration","data collection rate","simulations","teraFLOPS-class computers","data generation","data acquisition","insights","remote scientific instruments","data reduction","understanding","data interpretation","data visualization","online system","3D tomographic image reconstruction","collaborative data analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Distance visualization: data exploration on the grid","volume":"32","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6462523","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809249/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distance visualization: data exploration on the grid","sourcePdf":"00809249.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033073S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"34","articleId":"809249","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809266,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The classifier has been shown to produce error rates of 0%-2% using real nonnoisy images. The investigation looks at the robustness of the classifier with increased noise conditions and changes in the filtering of the images. It also identifies a set of features that are less susceptible to increased noise conditions and changes in the image filters. These features are the mean variance, and the variance of the rate of change in time of the intra-frame feature measures area, perimeter, compactness, maximum dimension and the first and second invariant moments of the objects. It is shown how the performance of the classifier can be improved. Success rates of up to 100% were obtained for a classifier trained under normal noise conditions, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) around 9.5 dB, and a noisy test sequence of SNR 7.6 dB.","doi":"10.1109/48.809266","startPage":"458","endPage":"469","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.809266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17560","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/17560/00809266.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of inter-frame feature measures for robust object classification in sector scan sonar image sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809266/","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of inter-frame feature measures for robust object classification in sector scan sonar image sequences","volume":"24","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6425985","publicationDate":"Oct. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of inter-frame feature measures for robust object classification in sector scan sonar image sequences","sourcePdf":"00809266.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037199S","chronDate":"Oct 1999","isNumber":"17560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"24","articleId":"809266","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":809269,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

In this paper, the similarities and differences between the continuous parameter and binary genetic algorithms are examined. The use of continuous parameters in genetic algorithms for the optimisation of antenna design is also presented.

If two signals at different carrier frequencies are incident at the input of an amplifier, due to the nonlinearity, these signals will interact with each other and the output will contain additional signals at all combinations of sum and difference of these frequencies, which are IM products. The injection of the second harmonics of the two input in the amplifier together with the fundamental signals will produce additional IM products at the output. By proper selection of phase and amplitude of the injected second harmonics, it is possible to make the third order IM products produced by the second harmonics and the original third order IM products out of phase and equal in amplitude. As. A result third order IM products will be eliminated, in principle. Theory and simulation results obtained at 1.9 GHz are presented which supports the suggestion. The output spectrum of the RF power amplifier is given.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-17 Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6537035","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low intermodulation amplifier for PHS applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low intermodulation amplifier for PHS applications","confLoc":"Leeds, UK","sourcePdf":"00809290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044378S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17534","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6562","articleId":"809290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":809292,"authors":[{"name":"Jietao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Electronics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK"],"lastName":"Jietao Zhang","id":"37281463100"},{"name":"Yi Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Electronics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK"],"lastName":"Yi Huang","id":"37278781900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-5577-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"809292","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":325},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Building materials","Reflection","Data mining","Dielectric measurements","Permittivity measurement","Materials testing","Dielectric materials","Reflectivity","Indoor environments","Time domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["materials testing","materials properties","time-domain analysis","electromagnetic wave reflection","electromagnetic wave transmission","radiowave propagation","indoor radio","permittivity measurement","network analysers","computerised instrumentation","microcomputer applications","horn antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric properties","building materials","free-space time-domain measurement","reflectivity","transmissibility","radio signal propagation","indoor environments","monostatic measurement system","multiple reflections","testing material","plane-wave reflection coefficient algorithm","complex permittivity","thickness","measured reflection data","transmission coefficient","network analyser","TEM horn antenna","personal computer"]}],"abstract":"Both the reflectivity and transmissibility of the building materials are dominant factors to the propagation of radio signal within indoor environments. As these parameters are strongly related to the dielectric properties of building materials, they can be obtained only when the building materials are well characterised. This paper describes an approach to extract the dielectric properties of building materials by using a free-space time-domain monostatic measurement system. Taking multiple reflections inside the testing material into account, a plane-wave reflection coefficient algorithm is implemented to extract both the complex permittivity and thickness of the testing material by optimising the measured reflection data. Both reflection coefficient from the material and transmission coefficient through the material can therefore be obtained from theoretical formulation.","doi":"10.1109/HFPSC.1999.809292","displayPublicationTitle":"MTT/ED/AP/LEO Societies Joint Chapter United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland Section. 1999 High Frequency Postgraduate Student Colloquium (Cat.

Recently, the phenomenon of \"software aging\", in which the state of the software system degrades with time, has been reported (S. Garg et al., 1998). The primary causes of this degradation are the exhaustion of operating system resources, data corruption and numerical error accumulation. This may eventually lead to performance degradation of the software or crash/hang failure, or both. Earlier work in this area to detect aging and to estimate its effect on system resources did not take into account the system workload. In this paper, we propose a measurement-based model to estimate the rate of exhaustion of operating system resources both as a function of time and the system workload state. A semi-Markov reward model is constructed based on workload and resource usage data collected from the UNIX operating system. We first identify different workload states using statistical cluster analysis and build a state-space model. Corresponding to each resource, a reward function is then defined for the model based on the rate of resource exhaustion in the different states. The model is then solved to obtain trends and the estimated exhaustion rates and the time-to-exhaustion for the resources. With the help of this measure, proactive fault management techniques such as \"software rejuvenation\" (Y. Huang et al., 1995) may be employed to prevent unexpected outages.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 10th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (Cat.

Correspondingly, the last few years have seen a number of architecture-based techniques employing analytical methods, simulation and experimentation to characterize the behavior of such systems. Whereas most of the previously reported efforts were focussed on the evaluation of software systems using architecture-based techniques, the utility of these techniques in the design phase to evaluate a set of competing alternatives remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop an optimization framework founded on the architecture-based analysis techniques, and describe how the framework can be used to evaluate cost and reliability tradeoffs using a genetic algorithm. The choice of genetic algorithms as the underlying optimization technique is motivated by three facts, namely a potentially large and discontinuous search space, a usually nonlinear but monotonic relation between the cost and reliability of individual modules comprising the software, and complex software architectures giving rise to nonlinear dependencies between individual module reliabilities and the overall system reliability. We conclude the paper by illustrating the framework with several examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1999","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1999","accessionNumber":"6431166","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 1999","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"Exploring cost and reliability tradeoffs in architectural alternatives using a genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring cost and reliability tradeoffs in architectural alternatives using a genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Boca Raton, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00809315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040277S","chronDate":"1999","isNumber":"17535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6563","citationCount":"15","articleId":"809315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":809355,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Performance is studied via RSIM, an execution-driven simulator, for three uniprocessor models that exploit instruction-level parallelism to varying degrees. Several properties of the program are noted. Out-of-order dispatch and multiple issue provide a significant performance advantage: 50%-250% improvement in inter-processor communication (IPC) for out-of-order dispatch vs. in-order dispatch, and 5%-120% improvement in IPC for four-way issue vs. single issue. Multiple issue provides a greater performance improvement for larger L2 cache sizes, when the program is limited by CPU performance; out-of-order dispatch provides a greater performance improvement for smaller L2 cache sizes. The program has a very small instruction footprint: for an 8-kB L1 instruction cache, the instruction miss rate is below 0.1%. A small (8 kB) L1 data cache is sufficient to capture most of the locality of the data references, resulting in L1 miss rates between 10%-20%. Increasing the size of the L2 data cache does not significantly improve performance until a significant fraction (over 1/4) of the data set fits into the L2 cache. Lastly, a procedure is developed for scaling the cache sizes when using scaled-down data sets, allowing the results for smaller data sets to be used to predict the performance of full-sized data sets.","doi":"10.1109/WWC.1998.809358","publicationTitle":"Workload Characterization: Methodology and Case Studies.

The application, extracted from the IBM Intelligent Miner, identifies groups of records that are mathematically similar, based on a neural network model called a self-organizing map. We examine and compare, in detail, two implementations of the application: (1) temporal locality or working set size; (2) spatial locality and memory block utilization; (3) communication characteristics and scalability; and (4) translation lookaside buffer (TLB) performance. First, we find that the working set hierarchy of the application is governed by two parameters, namely the size of an input record and the size of prototype array; it is independent of the number of input records. Second, the application shows good spatial locality, with the implementation optimized for sparse data sets having slightly worse spatial locality. Third, due to the batch update scheme, the application bears very low communication. Finally, a two-way set-associative TLB may result in severely skewed TLB performance in a multiprocessor environment, caused by the large discrepancy in the number of conflict misses. Increasing the set associativity is more effective in mitigating the problem than increasing the TLB size.","publicationTitle":"Workload Characterization: Methodology and Case Studies.

The solution to these faults depends on whether or not we are dealing with a reprogrammable FPGA or a one time programmable (OTP) FPGA. To correct faults, developers can reconfigure FPGAs such as those made by Xilinx and Altera by reprogramming. These devices can be programmed many times, for different designs and applications. Correcting faults in OTP FPGAs, such as those made by Actel is more difficult. For one thing, OTP FPGAs are based on antifuses. With an antifuse, the FPGAs configuration information has an initial (default) value that can be changed, but once changed cannot be restored. Therefore, the procedures to bypass faulty cells or faulty routing in an OTP FPGA must meet more stringent requirements than for reprogrammable FPGAs. The \"Reconfiguration Approaches\" sidebar describes two methods other researchers have tried. This article describes our approach to reconfiguring OTP FPGAs. We explain how we determine if reconfiguration is feasible, the algorithms we used, and the results of our experiments on a generic OTP FPGA model and a generic detail router.","doi":"10.1109/40.809378","publicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","pdfPath":"/iel5/40/17556/00809378.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17556","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/40.809378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfiguring one-time programmable FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Reconfiguring one-time programmable FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6461903","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfiguring one-time programmable FPGAs","sourcePdf":"00809378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030438S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1999","isNumber":"17556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"3","articleId":"809378","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809383,"authors":[{"name":"D.O.

Historically, traffic engineering in the Internet has been hampered by the limited functional capabilities of conventional IP technologies.

This leads to technical requirements for IMT-2000 which are currently being standardized worldwide. Circuit- and packet-oriented services will be supported. These systems will operate in all radio environments to provide service to anyone, anytime, anywhere. The ITU has identified spectrum for the allocation of IMT-2000. However, these frequency bands are currently not available worldwide. In different regions research activities on IMT-2000 have been initiated to support the international consensus building process and standardization activities. Based on these activities system proposals have been submitted to ITU TG 8/1. In particular, the newly formed Third Generation Partnership Projects 3GPP and 3GPP2 have the objective of harmonizing similar proposals and defining detailed standards. Proposals from Europe, Japan, Korea, and the United States are very similar. The evolution and migration of second-generation systems to the third generation takes into account the deployed investment to save today's investment where useful and necessary. This article focuses on market and technical requirements and, in particular, the technical approach of 3GPP based on the big footprint of the GSM system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The 3GPP proposal for IMT-2000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/35.809388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/17555/00809388.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"81","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.809388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809388/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"The 3GPP proposal for IMT-2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"37","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6472363","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The 3GPP proposal for IMT-2000","sourcePdf":"00809388.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067391S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"112","articleId":"809388","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809389,"authors":[{"name":"R. van Nee","affiliation":["Lucent Technologies Bell Laboratories"],"firstName":"R.","lastName":"van Nee","id":"37347315800"},{"name":"G.

Given the expectation that most endpoint-generated traffic will be in the form of connectionless (CL) IP datagrams, we address the problem of how to internetwork a CL (IP) network with a CO network. CO networks can be packet-switched or circuit-switched. Examples of packet-switched CO networks include ATM and MPLS networks, in which resource reservations are made at the ATM or shim layer, and IP-switch-based networks, in which resource reservations are made at the IP layer. Examples of circuit-switched networks include SONET/SDH and WDM networks that consist of programmable optical crossconnects. We consider the internetworking problem for two modes of operation of CO networks: provisioned, in which connections are set up a priori, and switched, in which connections are set up on demand. The main focus of this article is on the more complex problem: the internetworking of CL IP networks with CO networks operated in a switched mode. Our solution consists of (i) interworking user plane protocols with protocol conversion in some cases instead of always using protocol encapsulation, (ii) interworking routing protocols by either simply having gateways know routing information of both networks or having all nodes know routing information of both networks, and (iii) interworking signaling protocols by using application- or transport-layer end-to-end handshakes to trigger connection setups through the CO network. We demonstrate throughput improvements with our integrated routing interworking scheme over the MPOA IP-ATM internetworking solution for two example networks.","doi":"10.1109/35.809397","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","startPage":"130","endPage":"138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/17555/00809397.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.809397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Internetworking connectionless and connection oriented networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internetworking","Routing protocols","Transport protocols","Telecommunication traffic","IP networks","Circuits","Asynchronous transfer mode","Multiprotocol label switching","SONET","Synchronous digital hierarchy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internetworking","transport protocols","packet switching","circuit switching","Internet","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internetworking","connectionless oriented networks","connection oriented networks","IP traffic","endpoint-generated traffic","IP datagrams","packet-switching","ATM","MPLS","resource reservations","shim layer","IP-switch-based networks","IP layer","circuit-switched networks","SONET/SDH","WDM","programmable optical crossconnects","CL IP networks","user plane protocols","protocol conversion","protocol encapsulation","routing protocols","signaling protocols","end-to-end handshakes","connection setups","MPOA IP-ATM internetworking solution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Internetworking connectionless and connection oriented networks","volume":"37","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6472366","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809397/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Internetworking connectionless and connection oriented networks","sourcePdf":"00809397.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049371S","chronDate":"Dec.  1999","isNumber":"17555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"4","articleId":"809397","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809439,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In this paper we examine a new instruction prefetch architecture called Fetch Directed Prefetching, and compare it to the performance of next-line prefetching and streaming buffers. This architecture uses a decoupled branch predictor and instruction cache, so the branch predictor can run ahead of the instruction cache fetch. In addition, we examine marking fetch blocks in the branch predictor that are kicked out of the instruction cache, so branch predicted fetch blocks can be accurately prefetched. Finally, we model the use of idle instruction cache ports to filter prefetch requests, thereby saving bus bandwidth to the L2 cache.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICRO.1999.809439","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1999.809439","startPage":"16","endPage":"27","pdfPath":"/iel5/6577/17552/00809439.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"MICRO-32.

By fusing conventional vector ISA approaches together with more recent SIMD-like (Single Instruction Multiple Data) ISAs (such as MMX), we have developed a new matrix oriented ISA which efficiently deals with the small matrix structures typically found in multimedia applications. MOM exploits a level of DLP not reachable by neither conventional vector ISAs nor SIMD-like media ISA extensions. Our results show that MOM provides a factor of 1.3x to 4x performance improvement when compared with two different multimedia extensions (MMX and MDMX) on several kernels, which translates into up to a 50% of performance gain when measuring full applications (20% in average). Furthermore, the streaming nature of MOM provides additional advantages for executing multimedia applications, such as a very low fetch pressure or a high tolerance to memory latency, making MOM an ideal candidate for the embedded domain.","displayPublicationTitle":"MICRO-32.

The miss classification table works by storing part of the tag of the most recently evicted line of a cache set. If the next miss to that cache set has a matching tag, it is identified as a conflict miss. This technique correctly identifies 87% of misses in the worst case. Several applications of this information are demonstrated, including improvements to victim caching, next-line prefetching, cache exclusion, and a pseudo-associative cache. This paper also presents the Adaptive Miss Buffer (AMB), which combines several of these techniques, targeting each miss with the most appropriate optimization, all within a single small miss buffer. The AMB's combination of techniques achieves 16% better performance than any single technique alone.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1999.809450","publicationTitle":"MICRO-32.

However, previous work has shown that these ILP techniques are less effective in removing memory stall time than CPU time, making the memory system a greater bottleneck in ILP-based systems than previous-generation systems. These deficiencies arise largely because applications present limited opportunities for an out-of-order issue processor to overlap multiple read misses, the dominant source of memory stalls. This work proposes code transformations to increase parallelism in the memory system by overlapping multiple read misses within the same instruction window, while preserving cache locality. We present an analysis and transformation framework suitable for compiler implementation. Our simulation experiments show substantial increases in memory parallelism, leading to execution time reductions averaging 23% in a multiprocessor and 30% in a uniprocessor. We see similar benefits on a Convex Exemplar.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1999.809452","publicationTitle":"MICRO-32.

This paper proposes an approach that integrates architecture and compiler techniques to exploit value locality for large regions of code. The approach strives to eliminate redundant processor execution created by both instruction-level input repetition and recurrence of input data within high-level computations. In this approach, the compiler performs analysis to identify code regions whose computation can be reused during dynamic execution. The instruction set architecture provides a simple interface for the compiler to communicate the scope of each reuse region and its live-out register information to the hardware. During run time, the execution results of these reusable computation regions are recorded into hardware buffers for potential reuse. Each reuse can eliminate the execution of a large number of dynamic instructions. Furthermore, the actions needed to update the live-out registers can be performed at a higher degree of parallelism than the original code, breaking intrinsic dataflow dependence constraints. Initial results show that the compiler analysis can indeed identify large reuse regions. Overall, the approach can improve the performance of a 6-issue microarchitecture by an average of 30% for a collection of SPEC and integer benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1999.809453","publicationTitle":"MICRO-32.

Designers must verify the correctness of large complex systems and construct implementations that work reliably in varied (and occasionally adverse) operating conditions. To further complicate this task, deep submicron fabrication technologies present new reliability challenges in the form of degraded signal quality and logic failures caused by natural radiation interference. In this paper, we introduce dynamic verification, a novel microarchitectural technique that can significantly reduce the burden of correctness in microprocessor designs. The approach works by augmenting the commit phase of the processor pipeline with a functional checker unit. The functional checker verifies the correctness of the core processor's computation, only permitting correct results to commit. Overall design cost can be dramatically reduced because designers need only verify the correctness of the checker unit. We detail the DIVA checker architecture, a design optimized for simplicity and low cost. Using detailed timing simulation, we show that even resource-frugal DIVA checkers have little impact on core processor performance. To make the case for reduced verification costs, we argue that the DIVA checker should lend itself to functional and electrical verification better than a complex core processor. Finally, future applications that leverage dynamic verification to increase processor performance and availability are suggested.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microarchitecture","Microprocessors","Cost function","Buildings","Fabrication","Degradation","Logic","Interference","Pipelines","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing","VLSI","microprocessor chips","substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DIVA","reliable substrate","deep submicron microarchitecture design","high-performance microprocessor","deep submicron fabrication","reliability challenges","logic failures","dynamic verification","processor pipeline","detailed timing simulation","timing simulation","electrical verification","complex core processor","processor performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809458","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1999.809458","displayPublicationTitle":"MICRO-32.

Selective cache ways provides the ability to disable a subset of the ways in a set associative cache during periods of modest cache activity, while the full cache may remain operational for more cache-intensive periods. Because this approach leverages the subarray partitioning that is already present for performance reasons, only minor changes to a conventional cache are required and therefore, full-speed cache operation can be maintained. Furthermore, the tradeoff between performance and energy is flexible, and can be dynamically tailored to meet changing application and machine environmental conditions. We show that trading off a small performance degradation for energy savings can produce a significant reduction in cache energy dissipation using this approach.","doi":"10.1109/MICRO.1999.809463","publicationTitle":"MICRO-32.

The resulting design has a much wider range of unhindered motion than other spherical stepper motor designs in the literature.

For the mechanisms studied here, conditions for static balancing are obtained, and it is shown that balancing is generally possible, even when the dimensional parameters are imposed, which is a useful property since dimensional parameters are usually obtained from kinematic design or optimization. Then, the conditions for the static balancing of the same mechanisms are derived for designs in which elastic elements are included. Finally, examples of balanced mechanisms are given.

The HFR consists of an arm covered with viscoelastic materials and a trunk with mechanical elements, such as springs and dampers. In an unexpected or expected collision with a human, the passive viscoelastic trunk of the HFR passively deforms in response to the collision/contact forces. It is difficult, however, for the end effector to perform a desired task owing to the deformation of the passive trunk. In order to deal with this problem, the joint configurations of the arm are directly calculated according to the passive trunk deformation. The HFR with the passive viscoelastic trunk is compared with a conventional industrial robot with a rigid trunk for evaluation. Simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed control method is useful for the end-effector position control and the passive viscoelastic trunk suitable for the suppression of collision/contact forces.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809520/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6462896","volume":"4","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Collision-tolerant control of human-friendly robot with viscoelastic trunk","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collision-tolerant control of human-friendly robot with viscoelastic trunk","sourcePdf":"00809520.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095179S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"43","articleId":"809520","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":809521,"authors":[{"name":"Syh-Shiuh Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Syh-Shiuh Yeh","id":"37287018400"},{"name":"Pau-Lo Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pau-Lo Hsu","id":"37276890600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1083-4435"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-014X"}],"articleNumber":"809521","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":512},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ies/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division","url":"http://divisions.asme.org/dscd"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"  IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ncsu.edu/IEEE-RAS/"}],"abstract":"The zero phase error tracking controller (ZPETC) in motion control, as proposed by Tomizuka (1987) , renders the desirable zero phase error, but with a limited gain response. Moreover, a ZPETC, which is basically in a feedforward control structure, is very sensitive to modeling error. To improve the tracking accuracy of the ZPETC, this paper presents an optimal ZPETC design with a concise polynomial digital prefilter (DPF). The parameters of this well-designed DPF are obtained through the derived L/sub 2/-norm optimization. By cascading the developed DPF to the ZPETC, the resultant optimal ZPETC greatly improves the bandwidth of the tracking control systems while maintaining the zero phase error. Compared with other optimal approaches, the present design leads to much simpler procedures and fewer computations. Furthermore, the proposed optimal ZPETC can be adequately implemented as an adaptive ZPETC by including real-time estimation technique to cope with the external load perturbation and parameter variation. Compared with the other adaptive approaches, the optimal concept is used in the present adaptive ZPETC, and it also renders more accurate results because of its improved magnitude response. Experimental results on a DC servo table with different controllers indicate that when there is no loading, the present optimal ZPETC achieves the best tracking performance. Moreover, the adaptive ZPETC achieves the most satisfactory results when an external load is applied.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/17566/00809521.pdf","startPage":"428","endPage":"439","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/3516.809521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3516.809521","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17566","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809521","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimal and adaptive design of the feedforward motion controller","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Optimal control","Motion control","Error correction","Tracking","Polynomials","Bandwidth","Control systems","Servomechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward","motion control","optimisation","optimal control","control system synthesis","poles and zeros","DC motors","servomotors","adaptive control","frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward motion controller","zero phase error tracking controller","modeling error","tracking accuracy","optimal design","polynomial digital prefilter","L/sub 2/-norm optimization","external load perturbation","parameter variation","DC servo table"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809521/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"An optimal and adaptive design of the feedforward motion controller","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6462897","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimal and adaptive design of the feedforward motion controller","sourcePdf":"00809521.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042089S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"64","articleId":"809521","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809526,"authors":[{"name":"Junsong Li","affiliation":["CICTR, the Department of Electrical Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Junsong Li","id":"37440666300"},{"name":"M.

Three readout circuits, based on a fully differential cascode operational transconductance amplifier, designed and realized on a standard CMOS 0.7-/spl mu/m single polysilicon/double metal process, are proposed for CMOS active-pixel imagers. The first is an uncompensated switched capacitor (SC) voltage amplifier; the second, an offset compensated SC amplifier; and the third, a commutable bandpass filter. All three amplifiers allow correlated double sampling and double delta sampling for pixel and column fixed pattern noise suppression, respectively. The amplifiers offer up to 10-Mpixels/s readout rates. A detailed theoretical analysis of the amplifiers response to white noise and low-frequency excess noise is given, considering nonstationary nature of the output signals. An original method based on diffusive Markovian representation of 1/f/sup /spl alpha//-noise is used. The theoretical results are compared with experimental data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/82/17573/00809532.pdf","startPage":"1461","endPage":"1474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/82.809532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.809532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-stationary noise responses of some fully differential on-chip readout circuits suitable for CMOS image sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS process","White noise","Image sampling","Signal sampling","Low-frequency noise","CMOS image sensors","Image sensors","Character generation","Temperature dependence","Temperature distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","readout electronics","integrated circuit noise","white noise","1/f noise","operational amplifiers","switched capacitor networks","band-pass filters","image sampling","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonstationary noise","fully differential on-chip readout circuit","low-frequency excess noise","CMOS active-pixel image sensor","white noise","1/f/sup /spl alpha// noise","cascode operational transconductance amplifier","switched capacitor voltage amplifier","offset compensation","commutable bandpass filter","correlated double sampling","double delta sampling","diffusive Markovian model","0.7 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Non-stationary noise responses of some fully differential on-chip readout circuits suitable for CMOS image sensors","volume":"46","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6473919","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-stationary noise responses of some fully differential on-chip readout circuits suitable for CMOS image sensors","sourcePdf":"00809532.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056497S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"13","articleId":"809532","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809537,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The drawback with this approach is that the response of the spatial/spectral filters in between the grid points can be poor. More recently, an approach that performs the minimax design over the continuum of points in the decision space has appeared in the literature. In this brief, we describe an approach to solving this continuous decision space design problem that is numerically more elegant and efficient.

A small-signal circuit model is used to derive the input-to-output voltage transfer function (audio-susceptibility), the input impedance, and the output impedance. A response of the output voltage to a step change in the input voltage is also computed. The measured Bode plots of the input-to-output voltage transfer function agreed with that predicted theoretically.

Improved fraud detection thus has become essential to maintain the viability of the US payment system. Banks have used early fraud warning systems for some years. Large scale data-mining techniques can improve the state of the art in commercial practice. Scalable techniques to analyze massive amounts of transaction data that efficiently compute fraud detectors in a timely manner is an important problem, especially for e-commerce. Besides scalability and efficiency, the fraud-detection task exhibits technical problems that include skewed distributions of training data and nonuniform cost per error, both of which have not been widely studied in the knowledge-discovery and data mining community. In this article, we survey and evaluate a number of techniques that address these three main issues concurrently. Our proposed methods of combining multiple learned fraud detectors under a \"cost model\" are general and demonstrably useful; our empirical results demonstrate that we can significantly reduce loss due to fraud through distributed data mining of fraud models.","doi":"10.1109/5254.809570","publicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Systems and their Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Intelligent Systems and their Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5254/17571/00809570.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"74","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5254.809570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed data mining in credit card fraud detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809570/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Distributed data mining in credit card fraud detection","volume":"14","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6455450","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed data mining in credit card fraud detection","sourcePdf":"00809570.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054644S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1999","isNumber":"17571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5254","citationCount":"241","articleId":"809570","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809571,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Compilers for neural network learning algorithms can achieve near-optimal colocality of data and processes and near-optimal balancing of load over processors, even for dynamically irregular problems. This is impossible for general programs, but restricting programs to the neural algorithm domain allows for the exploitation of domain-specific properties. The operations performed by neural algorithms are broadcasts, reductions, and object-local operations only; the load distribution is regular with respect to the (perhaps irregular) network topology; changes of network topology occur only from time to time. A language, compilation techniques, and a compiler implementation on the MasPar MP-1 are described and quantitative results for the effects of various optimizations used in the compiler are shown. Conservative experiments with weight pruning algorithms yield performance improvements of 27 percent due to load balancing and 195 percent improvement is achieved due to data locality, both compared to unoptimized versions. Two other optimizations-connection allocation and selecting the number of replicates-speed programs up by about 50 percent and 100 percent, respectively. This work can be viewed as a case study in exploiting domain-specific information; some of the principles presented here may apply to other domains as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809571/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","volume":"10","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"6457969","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting domain-specific properties: compiling parallel dynamic neural network algorithms into efficient code","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting domain-specific properties: compiling parallel dynamic neural network algorithms into efficient code","sourcePdf":"00809571.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040881S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"19","articleId":"809571","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":809575,"authors":[{"name":"T.F.

Tasks are assumed to communicate via message passing based on a time bounded communication paradigm, such as the real time channel (D.D. Kandlur et al., 1994). The algorithm uses a branch-and-bound (B & B) technique to search for a task schedule by minimizing maximum task lateness (defined as the difference between task completion time and task deadline), and exploits the interplay between task and message scheduling to improve the quality of solution. It generates a complete schedule at each vertex in the search tree, and can be made to yield a feasible schedule (found before reaching an optimal solution), or proceed until an optimal task schedule is found. We have conducted an extensive simulation study to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm is shown to scale well with respect to system size and degree of intertask interactions. It also offers good performance for workloads with a wide range of CPU utilizations and application concurrency. For larger systems and higher loads, we introduce a greedy heuristic that is faster but has no optimality properties. We have also extended the algorithm to a more general resource-constraint model, thus widening its application domain.","doi":"10.1109/71.809575","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/17572/00809575.pdf","startPage":"1179","endPage":"1191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.809575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined task and message scheduling in distributed real-time systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809575","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809575/","displayDocTitle":"Combined task and message scheduling in distributed real-time systems","volume":"10","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1999","accessionNumber":"6457973","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined task and message scheduling in distributed real-time systems","sourcePdf":"00809575.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046421S","chronDate":"Nov 1999","isNumber":"17572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"81","articleId":"809575","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":809655,"authors":[{"name":"T.Y.

When test cases are allocated in proportion to the size of subdomains, partition testing strategies are provably better than random testing, in the sense of having a higher or equal probability of detecting at least one failure (the P-measure). Recently, the Generalised Proportional Sampling (GPS) strategy, which is always satisfiable, was proposed to relax the proportionality condition. The paper studies the use of approximation methods to generate test distributions satisfying the GPS strategy, and evaluates this proposal empirically. Our results are very encouraging, showing that on average about 98.72% to almost 100% of the test distributions obtained in this way are better than random testing in terms of the P-measure.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Sampling methods","Fault detection","Software testing","Computer science","Global Positioning System","Performance evaluation","Mathematics","Computer science education","Software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["program testing","probability","programming theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation methods","generalised proportional sampling strategy","partition testing strategies","random testing","unfavourable circumstances","P-measure","Generalised Proportional Sampling","GPS strategy","satisfiable","proportionality condition","test distributions","software testing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APSEC.1999.809655","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth Asia Pacific Software Engineering Conference (ASPEC'99) (Cat.

We refer to such networks as optical regional and metropolitan access networks (ORMA-Nets). Here, we qualitatively and quantitatively investigate many important principles, as well as challenges, in deploying ORMA-Nets. Access networks in general are functionally comprised of a feeder network, which is responsible for traffic aggregation, and a distribution network, which directly interfaces with the customer premises. We present several configurable, scalable designs for the feeder network that are capable of aggregating a range of traffic types and rates. We also present architectures for achieving a high degree of functionality using relatively low-cost, passive optical components in the distribution network. We explore topics such as optimal switch placement and wavelength banding, and emphasize the technologies that are needed to deliver advanced capabilities. Various underlying themes run throughout the paper, such as optionally not always using bandwidth as efficiently as possible in order to simplify the architecture, and the importance of transparency in providing enhanced services and architectural flexibility.","doi":"10.1109/50.809662","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17575","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.809662","endPage":"2448","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17575/00809662.pdf","startPage":"2431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architectural principles of optical regional and metropolitan access networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809662/","displayDocTitle":"Architectural principles of optical regional and metropolitan access networks","volume":"17","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"6463180","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectural principles of optical regional and metropolitan access networks","sourcePdf":"00809662.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06636S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"139","articleId":"809662","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":809668,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A semianalytical theory of the bandwidth evolution demonstrates that the introduction of prechirp is very important for controlling the single pulse propagation and numerical results show that such a chirp also permits to limit the nonlinear pulse interaction when other pulses are present. Simulations of a 40 Gb/s return-to-zero (RZ) system operating in links encompassing step-index fibers, by adopting a periodical compensation of the chromatic dispersion have been performed and results show that a record distance of 1300 km can be achieved with an amplifier spacing of 100 km. A compensation of the fiber third order dispersion would extend the transmission to 1800 km, which corresponds to the limits imposed by the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise of the optical amplifiers.","doi":"10.1109/50.809668","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","startPage":"2498","endPage":"2505","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/17575/00809668.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.809668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-channel transmission in dispersion management links in conditions of very strong pulse broadening: application to 40 Gb/s signals on step-index fibers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse amplifiers","Optical fiber amplifiers","Optical noise","Optical fiber theory","Bandwidth","Chirp","Chromatic dispersion","Spontaneous emission","Fiber nonlinear optics","Stimulated emission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre communication","optical fibre theory","optical fibre dispersion","superradiance","compensation","optical noise","telecommunication network management","chirp modulation","optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-channel transmission","dispersion management links","very strong pulse broadening","Gb/s signals","step-index fibers","dynamic behavior","strong dispersion management","pseudorandom pulse sequence","pulse interaction","semianalytical theory","bandwidth evolution","prechirp","single pulse propagation","nonlinear pulse interaction","return-to-zero system","periodical compensation","chromatic dispersion","amplifier spacing","fiber third order dispersion","amplified spontaneous emission","ASE noise","40 Gbit/s","1300 km","100 km","1800 km"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Single-channel transmission in dispersion management links in conditions of very strong pulse broadening: application to 40 Gb/s signals on step-index fibers","volume":"17","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6463186","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809668/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-channel transmission in dispersion management links in conditions of very strong pulse broadening: application to 40 Gb/s signals on step-index fibers","sourcePdf":"00809668.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036091S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"33","articleId":"809668","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809670,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Since the decision regions of the demodulator depend on the channel fading, estimation error of the channel variation can severely degrade the demodulator performance. Among the various fading estimation techniques, pilot symbol assisted modulation (PSAM) proves to be an effective choice. We first characterize the distribution of the amplitude and phase estimates using PSAM. We then use this distribution to obtain the BER of M-QAM as a function of the PSAM and channel parameters. By using a change of variables, our exact BER expression has a particularly simple form that involves just a few finite-range integrals. This approach can be used to compute the BER for any value of M. We compute the BER for 16-QAM and 64-QAM numerically and verify our analytical results by computer simulation. We show that for these modulations, amplitude estimation error leads to a 1-dB degradation in average signal-to-noise ratio and combined amplitude-phase estimation error leads to 2.5-dB degradation for the parameters we consider.","doi":"10.1109/26.809706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17576/00809706.pdf","startPage":"1856","endPage":"1864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.809706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of channel estimation error on M-QAM BER performance in Rayleigh fading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Effect of channel estimation error on M-QAM BER performance in Rayleigh fading","volume":"47","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6464272","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809706/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of channel estimation error on M-QAM BER performance in Rayleigh fading","sourcePdf":"00809706.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082072S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"185","articleId":"809706","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809707,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This protection ratio, with SFH, is dependent on the transmission system, channel model, traffic, and frequency reuse parameters. In this paper, the above-mentioned analysis is used in order to investigate the capacity of a SFH mobile radio system, with reference to both the uplink and downlink, by taking into account a complete scenario, i.e., shadowing, fast fading, power control, antenna diversity, discontinuous transmission, and forward error correction with nonideal interleaving and sectorization. Outage probability is evaluated by a completely analytical methodology for the uplink, whereas the downlink requires a semianalytical approach to take users' positions into account. Comparison with a pure simulative approach is used to validate the results.","doi":"10.1109/26.809707","startPage":"1865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17576/00809707.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.809707","endPage":"1874","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage evaluation for slow frequency-hopping mobile radio systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809707/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"Outage evaluation for slow frequency-hopping mobile radio systems","volume":"47","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6464273","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage evaluation for slow frequency-hopping mobile radio systems","sourcePdf":"00809707.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065807S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"41","articleId":"809707","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809708,"authors":[{"name":"Kwang Soon Kim","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Kwang Soon Kim","id":"37280249300"},{"name":"Iickho Song","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Iickho Song","id":"37289097300"},{"name":"Yun Hee Kim","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yun Hee Kim","id":"37280921800"},{"name":"Yong Up Lee","affiliation":["The Division of Electronics Engineering, School of Information and Electronics Engineering, Hallym University, Kangwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yong Up Lee","id":"38185571400"},{"name":"Jooshik Lee","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jooshik Lee","id":"37440997200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"809708","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":69},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Multiaccess communication","Decorrelation","Antenna arrays","Detectors","Sensor arrays","Time varying systems","Time-varying channels","Filters","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","code division multiple access","multiuser channels","time-varying channels","maximum likelihood detection","radio links","adaptive antenna arrays","array signal processing","adaptive estimation","recursive estimation","matrix decomposition","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","decorrelation","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-ML multiuser detection","DS/CDMA systems","asynchronous channels","quasi-maximum-likelihood detectors","reverse link system","antenna arrays","time-invariant channel vector","time-varying channel vector","channel vector estimation method","eigendecomposition","time-invariant channels","time-varying channels","adaptive estimation","beamformer","decorrelating filter","performance gain","decorrelator system","mobile radio","correlation matrix","fast recursive algorithm"]}],"abstract":"We consider the quasi-maximum-likelihood (quasi-ML) detectors of the reverse link system that uses antenna arrays in asynchronous channels when the channel vector is time-invariant and time-varying.

The chip weighting waveforms under consideration are designed for multiple-access interference (MAI) rejection. Assuming that the received chip waveforms are rectangular, new expressions for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the decision variable are derived when different weighted despreading sequences (WDSs) are used in the receiver. The novelty of the derived expressions is that each of the expressions, when the system parameters are given, is determined only by one parameter of the adjustable chip waveforms employed. As a result, we can simply tune the parameter to its optimal value in real-time for MAI rejection without knowing the other users' spreading codes, timing, and phase. The criterion for tuning the parameter is to maximize the SINR of the decision variable based on the relative strength between the additive Gaussian white noise and the MAI. Numerical results show that when the multiple-access interference is significant, the receivers using WDSs outperform significantly the conventional receiver using a rectangular despreading sequence. Brief analysis for bandlimited spreading signals is also provided to reveal the practical implications of the proposed technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DS-CDMA system using despreading sequences weighted by adjustable chip waveforms","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.809709","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/17576/00809709.pdf","startPage":"1884","endPage":"1896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.809709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17576","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=809709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/809709/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1999","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1999","displayDocTitle":"A DS-CDMA system using despreading sequences weighted by adjustable chip waveforms","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1999","accessionNumber":"6464275","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DS-CDMA system using despreading sequences weighted by adjustable chip waveforms","sourcePdf":"00809709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03754S","chronDate":"Dec 1999","isNumber":"17576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"27","articleId":"809709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":809710,"authors":[{"name":"Dongwook Lee","affiliation":["Radio and Broadcasting Technology Laboratory, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dongwook Lee","id":"37441244800"},{"name":"L.B.

A fixed step PC algorithm becomes almost perfect when the power command rate is too fast compared to the Doppler rate, which is the case for low-mobility users.

Multichannel code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems are proposed. It is proved that the probability, in which the individual channel complexity is greater than A/sup r(1+/spl alpha/)/, approaches zero exponentially fast as the average number of simultaneous users in each channel increases, where A is the modulation alphabet size and /spl alpha/>0. When the number of simultaneous users is large, the complexity of applying the VOMD algorithm to each individual channel is negligible when compared with the complexity of applying the same algorithm directly to the traditional single-channel CDMA system supporting the same number of simultaneous users. The probability distribution of the joint complexity function of the aggregate system is found. It is shown that when the number of simultaneous users is large, the joint complexity function is negligible compared with applying the VOMD algorithm directly to the traditional single-channel CDMA system supporting the same number of simultaneous users.

The shield region is eliminated from the computational domain and the INBCs are applied on the new boundary surfaces, i.e., shield surfaces, to take into account the field discontinuity produced by the shield. The INBCs represent an important extension of the well-known surface impedance boundary conditions (SIBCs) since the INBCs model accurately the coupling of the electromagnetic fields through penetrable shields and lead to a significant reduction of the number of the FDTD unknowns. The INBC expressions are given analytically in both frequency and time domains, and the INBC implementation in a FDTD code is discussed. The proposed INBC-FDTD method is numerically efficient because the resulting convolution integrals are recursively solved. Furthermore, approximate time-constant INBCs are proposed which are valid for many practical applications.

We develop a multi-resolution view of the data via hierarchical clustering, and use a variation of parallel coordinates to convey aggregation information for the resulting clusters. Users can then navigate the resulting structure until the desired focus region and level of detail is reached, using our suite of navigational and filtering tools. We describe the design and implementation of our hierarchical parallel coordinates system which is based on extending the XmdvTool system.

Each node in an image graph consists of an image and the corresponding visualization parameters used to produce it. Each edge in a graph shows the change in rendering parameters between the two nodes it connects. Image graphs are not just static representations; users can interact with a graph to review a previous visualization session or to perform new rendering. Operations which cause changes in rendering parameters can propagate through the graph. The user can take advantage of the information in image graphs to understand how certain parameter changes affect visualization results. Users can also share image graphs to streamline the process of collaborative visualization. We have implemented a volume visualization system using the image graph interface, and the examples presented come from this application.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=17553","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

Cloth has very little in-plane deformations, as most of the deformations come from buckling. This can be looked at as area conservation property of cloth. The area conservation formulation of the method modulates the user defined wrinkle pattern, based on deformation of individual triangle. The methodology facilitates use of small in-plane deformation stiffnesses and a coarse mesh for the numerical simulation, this makes cloth simulation fast and robust. Moreover, the ability to design wrinkles (even on generalized deformable models) makes this method versatile for synthetic image generation. The method inspired from cloth wrinkling problem, being geometric in nature, can be extended to other wrinkling phenomena.","doi":"10.1109/VISUAL.1999.809885","startPage":"175","endPage":"523","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Visualization '99 (Cat.

The proposed controller is designed for a real platform in combination with a monocular vision system. The objective of the controller is to learn an optimal policy to reach and to grasp a spherical object of known size, randomly placed in the environment. In order to accomplish this, the task has been treated as a reinforcement problem, in which the controller learns by a trial and error approach the situation-action mapping. The optimal policy is found by using the Q-learning algorithm, a model free reinforcement learning technique, that rewards actions that move the arm closer to the target. The vision system uses geometrical computation to simplify the segmentation of the moving target and determines an estimate of the target parameters. The simulated knowledge has been ported on the industrial robot manipulator PUMA 560. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive controller that does not require an explicit global target position using direct perception of the environment.","doi":"10.1109/CIRA.1999.809933","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIRA.1999.809933","startPage":"7","endPage":"14","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1999 IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation.
