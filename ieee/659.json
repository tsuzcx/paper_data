The PA is designed with three dynamically-biased stacked Cascode cells (6 stacked transistors) to overcome the low breakdown voltages of nanoscale CMOS transistors. The stacked Cascode cells ensure stable operation and facilitate high gain, and high optimum load impedance, leading to high output power, high efficiency and good linearity characteristics over the entire bandwidth. The unbalanced amplitude and phase of drain-source voltage signals caused by internodal parasitic capacitance are equalized by adjusting the sizing of transistors. With a supply voltage of 4.8 V at 12 GHz, the measured saturated output power and linear power are 22.5 dBm and 19.2 dBm, respectively, while the peak power-added efficiency (PAE) is 19.2%.

In this paper, a framework for optimal design of battery charging/swap stations in distribution systems based on life cycle cost (LCC) is presented. The battery charging/swap station models are developed to compare the impacts of rapid-charging stations and battery swap stations. Meanwhile, in order to meet the requirements of increased power provided during the charging period, the distribution network should be reinforced. In order to control this reinforcement cost, stations should be placed at appropriate places and be scaled correctly. For optimal cost-benefit analysis and safety operation, the LCC criterion is used to assess the project and a modified differential evolution algorithm is adopted to solve the problem. The proposed method has been verified on the modified IEEE 15-bus and 43-bus radial distribution systems. The results show that battery swap station is more suitable for public transportation in distribution systems.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2278852","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6684613/06590033.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"229","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2278852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electric Vehicle Battery Charging/Swap Stations in Distribution Systems: Comparison Study and Optimal Planning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6590033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Electric Vehicle Battery Charging/Swap Stations in Distribution Systems: Comparison Study and Optimal Planning","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","accessionNumber":"13973441","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6590033/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electric Vehicle Battery Charging/Swap Stations in Distribution Systems: Comparison Study and Optimal Planning","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-dong-2278852-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084573S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6684613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"270","xplore-issue":"6684613","articleId":"6590033","onlineDate":"06 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6590037,"authors":[{"name":"Mozhgan Mansuri","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6671390/6590037/6590037-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mozhgan Mansuri (S'00\u2013M'03) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1995 and 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 2003.","She was a Design Engineer with Kavoshgaran Company, Tehran, Iran, where she worked on the design of 46\u201349-MHz cordless and 900-MHz cellular phones from 1997 to 1999.

At maximum aggregate bandwidth of 1.024 Tb/s across 50-cm channel length, the link consumes 2.7 W from a 1.08-V supply, corresponding to 2.6 pJ/bit. As bandwidth demand decreases, scaling the per-lane data rate to 4 Gb/s and power supply to 0.65 V provides 1/4 of the maximum bandwidth while consuming 0.2 W. Across a 1-m channel, the link operates at a maximum per-lane data rate of 16 Gb/s; thus, providing up to 1.024 Tb/s of aggregate bandwidth with 3.2 pJ/bit power efficiency from a 1.15-V supply. A length-matched dense interconnect topology allows clocking to be shared across multiple lanes to reduce area and power. Reconfigurable current/voltage mode transmitter driver and CMOS clocking enable a highly scalable power-efficient link. Optional low-dropout regulators provide >22-dB supply noise rejection at the package resonance frequency of 200 MHz. System-level optimization of duty-cycle and quadrature error correctors across the clock hierarchy provides optimized clock phase placement and, thus, enhances link performance and power.

Yet, most research to date has focused on communications along the body surface among devices interconnected through traditional electromagnetic radio-frequency (RF) carrier waves; while the underlying root challenge of enabling networked intra-body miniaturized sensors and actuators that communicate through body tissues is substantially unaddressed. The main obstacle to enabling this vision of networked implantable devices is posed by the physical nature of propagation in the human body. The human body is composed primarily (65 percent) of water, a medium through which RF electromagnetic waves do not easily propagate, even at relatively low frequencies. Therefore, in this article we take a different perspective and propose to investigate and study the use of ultrasonic waves to wirelessly internetwork intra-body devices. We discuss the fundamentals of ultrasonic propagation in tissues, and explore important tradeoffs, including the choice of a transmission frequency, transmission power, and transducer size. Then, we discuss future research challenges for ultrasonic networking of intra-body devices at the physical, medium access and network layers of the protocol stack.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2013.6590053","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/6590039/06590053.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2013.6590053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6590039","startPage":"74","endPage":"81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasonic networking for E-health applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6590053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic networking for E-health applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6590053/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"4","publicationDate":"August 2013","accessionNumber":"13749565","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6590053/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic networking for E-health applications","sourcePdf":"014MELODIA_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046925S","chronDate":"August  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6590039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6590039","articleId":"6590053","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6590055,"authors":[{"name":"Phond Phunchongharn","affiliation":["University of Manitoba, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Phond Phunchongharn received B.E. in 2005 and M.E. in 2007, both in Computer Engineering from King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), Thailand.

Deviceto- device (D2D) communications is a promising technique to provide wireless peer-to-peer services and enhance spectrum utilization in the LTE-Advanced networks. In D2D communications, the user equipments (UEs) are allowed to directly communicate between each other by reusing the cellular resources rather than using uplink and downlink resources in the cellular mode when communicating via the base station. However, enabling D2D communications in a cellular network poses two major challenges. First, the interference caused to the cellular users by D2D devices could critically affect the performances of the cellular devices. Second, the minimum quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of D2D communications need to be guaranteed. In this article, we introduce a novel resource allocation scheme (i.e. joint resource block scheduling and power control) for D2D communications in LTE-Advanced networks to maximize the spectrum utilization while addressing the above challenges. First, an overview of LTE-Advanced networks, and architecture and signaling support for provisioning of D2D communications in these networks are described. Furthermore, research issues and the current state-of-the-art of D2D communications are discussed. Then, a resource allocation scheme based on a column generation method is proposed for D2D communications. The objective is to maximize the spectrum utilization by finding the minimum transmission length in terms of time slots for D2D links while protecting the cellular users from harmful interference and guaranteeing the QoS of D2D links. The performance of this scheme is evaluated through simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6590055/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2013","volume":"20","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13749567","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","publicationDate":"August 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6590055/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation for device-to-device communications underlaying LTE-advanced networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation for device-to-device communications underlaying LTE-advanced networks","sourcePdf":"016HOSSAIN_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.196928S","chronDate":"August  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6590039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"298","xplore-issue":"6590039","articleId":"6590055","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6590056,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Rui","affiliation":["CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AND STATE KEY LAB OF ISN"],"bio":{"p":["Yun Rui [M'11] received the B.S. degree from Southeast University (SEU) in 2004 and the Ph.D. degree from Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 2009, all in telecommu- nications engineering.

This article first introduces and compares several uplink multiple access schemes in LTE-Advanced standard. Technical challenges arising from the use of carrier aggregation is then addressed, with focus on reference signals design for uplink transmission. Meanwhile, various candidate options are summarized and compared in terms of their system performance, computational complexity, and design flexibility. The article further proceeds to investigate the link performance with carrier aggregation, taking into account the presence of frequency offset and fast fading in the uplink channel. Numerical results are also presented, which indicate that advanced signal processing algorithms should be further studied and optimized to ensure reliable operation of the 3GPP LTE-Advanced in high mobility.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6590056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6590056/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","publicationDate":"August 2013","accessionNumber":"13749568","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Carrier aggregation for LTE-advanced: uplink multiple access and transmission enhancement features","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier aggregation for LTE-advanced: uplink multiple access and transmission enhancement features","sourcePdf":"017RUI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051323S","chronDate":"August  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6590039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6590039","articleId":"6590056","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6590058,"authors":[{"name":"Qinyu Zhang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"bio":{"p":["Qinyu Zhang (zqy@hit.edu.cn) received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Tokushima, Japan, in 2003.

The research philosophies of wireless communications have been shifted from balancing reliability-efficiency tradeoff in the link level to seeking spectrum-energy efficiency in the network level. Global spectrum-energy efficient designs attract significant attention to improving utilization and efficiency, wherein cognitive radio networks and energy scavenging related techniques are of particular interests. In this article, we first provide a systematic study on cooperative cognitive radio networking (CCRN), followed by the discussions on research issues and challenges in designing spectrum-energy complexity efficient CCRN. As an effort to shed light on addressing spectrum-energy inefficiency at a low complexity, a novel CCRN paradigm exploiting polarization and energy harvesting capabilities is elaborated. Specifically, we present a novel polarization and energy harvesting based framework for achieving size-cost effective CCRN. We introduce polarization signal processing to avoid interference between secondary users and primary users in cooperation. We propose a weighted sum spectrum efficiency based problem formulation and multi-timescale dynamic programming based energy/power allocation policy to evaluate the cooperation performance, subject to energy levels, power, and throughput constraints.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2013.6590058","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/6590039/06590058.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6590039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2013.6590058","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","startPage":"116","endPage":"124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On exploiting polarization for energy-harvesting enabled cooperative cognitive radio networking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6590058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"On exploiting polarization for energy-harvesting enabled cooperative cognitive radio networking","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6590058/","volume":"20","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6590058/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2013","accessionNumber":"13749570","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On exploiting polarization for energy-harvesting enabled cooperative cognitive radio networking","sourcePdf":"019ZHANG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091945S","chronDate":"August  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6590039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6590039","articleId":"6590058","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6590059,"authors":[{"name":"Honggang Wang","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Honggang Wang received a Ph.

For example, huge amount of data related to monitoring and control will be transmitted across smart grid wireless communication infrastructures, with intensive interference and increasing competition over the limited and crowded radio spectrum for the existing wireless networking standards. The opportunistic spectrum access with cognitive radios is a promising wireless technology to improve the frequency/spectrum utilization by detecting unoccupied spectrum holes of primary users and assigning them to secondary users. The versatile features of cognitive radio technology satisfy the requirements of smart grid communications. On the other hand, there are growing needs of multimedia applications via smart grid communication infrastructures that require large bandwidth and network resources.

Each path through the Viterbi decoding trellis is equivalent to a path through a weighted directed graph. Error patterns in decoded information blocks thus correspond to cycles in the graph. A sliding window is used to trap these cycles. The change in partial path metric across the window determines the reliability of the maximum likelihood path. If the maximum likelihood path is deemed unreliable, a retransmission request is generated. Implementation of this error-trapping ARQ scheme requires a minor modification of the Viterbi decoder.

The author examines the effect systematically.

Such a low rate code may be obtained by designing a code with that rate and maximum minimum distance, or by using a higher rate code and diversity. The latter approach is usually suboptimal from a minimum distance point of view, but may have implementation advantages. The authors consider this trade-off between coding and diversity, in terms of minimum distance, for both block and convolutional codes. It is concluded that for many applications of convolutional codes, there is little performance loss in achieving the low rate code with diversity and coding. The same does not seem to hold true for block codes. This situation is quantified further in the paper.","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.1991.6592938","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9754/6452116/06592938.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"92","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.1991.6592938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6452116","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding, diversity and minimum distance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6592938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1991","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6592938/","displayDocTitle":"Coding, diversity and minimum distance","volume":"16","issue":"3","publicationDate":"July 1991","accessionNumber":"3995172","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding, diversity and minimum distance","sourcePdf":"087092.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029724S","chronDate":"July  1991","isNumber":"6452116","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6592938","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6593006,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This paper proposes two simple models for a class of nonlinear elements which can be represented by frequency-dependent AM/AM and AM/PM characteristics. The simplicity of these models makes them appealing for analysis and simulation considerations. With these models, the analysis techniques that have been developed to study the behavior of signals through effectively memoryless nonlinear elements such as helix-type TWTAs can directly be applied.

Time-division multiplexing (TDM) baseband transmission methods require high-speed multiplexing and precise clock recovery, and/or multiple fibres for such applications. As an alternative, the authors propose and analyze a quasi-orthogonal subcarrier multiplexing technique (QO-SCM) for short-reach digital fibre-optic interconnect applications. QO-SCM signal processing exploits the symbol-time synchronism which is inherent among the parallel lines of a typical data bus, to permit simplified filtering and higher spectral efficiency than conventional SCM. One can achieve bandwidth efficiencies of up to 2 b/s/Hz while eliminating RF channel filters and guard bands, and requiring only simple baseband pulse shaping. Link performance is studied through simulation to derive worst-case noise margins for a 50-channel QO-SCM pay-load signal with 10 Gb/s total capacity using a numerical model of the laser rate equations.

A novel scheme of geographical load balancing was proposed to reduce electricity bills for service providers. However, one important challenge faced by service providers has not been considered properly. In service systems, the service delay faced by consumers includes the queuing delay and the transmission delay. While existing work only consider the queuing delay, the transmission delay introduced by geographical load balancing has been overlooked. It is one of the most important factors affecting the quality of service for real-time service systems. In this paper, we take the transmission delay into our design consideration and formulate a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with coupled constraint to achieve the optimal load balancing and energy cost management for IDCs while meeting the service-level agreements (SLA) of consumers. A novel heuristic based branch and bound with feedback (HBBF) algorithm is proposed to decouple the MINLP problem with coupled constraint efficiently. Extensive performance evaluations based on real electricity price data and site-to-site transmission delay data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2013.227","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6895194/06594731.pdf","startPage":"2659","endPage":"2669","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6895194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Load Balancing and Energy Cost Management for Internet Data Centers in Deregulated Electricity Markets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6594731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594731/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Load Balancing and Energy Cost Management for Internet Data Centers in Deregulated Electricity Markets","volume":"25","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14580871","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6594731/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Load Balancing and Energy Cost Management for Internet Data Centers in Deregulated Electricity Markets","sourcePdf":"tpds-shao-227-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106655S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6895194","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6895194","articleId":"6594731","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6594736,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Ghosh","affiliation":["IBM, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/6983668/6594736/6594736-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rahul Ghosh received the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from Duke University, Durham, NC, USA, in 2012.

In an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) Cloud, virtual machine (VM) instances share the physical machines (PMs) in the provider's data center. With large number of PMs, providers can maintain low cost of service downtime at the expense of higher infrastructure and other operational costs (e.g., power consumption and cooling costs). Hence, determining the optimal PM capacity requirements that minimize the overall cost is of interest. In this paper, we show how a cost analysis and optimization framework can be developed using stochastic availability and performance models of an IaaS Cloud. Specifically, we study two cost minimization problems to address the capacity planning in an IaaS Cloud: (1) what is the optimal number of PMs that minimizes the total cost of ownership for a given downtime requirement set by service level agreements? and, (2) is it more economical to use cheaper but less reliable PMs or to use costlier but more reliable PMs for insuring the same availability characteristics? We use simulated annealing, a well-known stochastic search algorithm, to solve these optimization problems. Results from our analysis show that the optimal solutions are found within reasonable time.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6983668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2013.44","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/6983668/06594736.pdf","startPage":"667","endPage":"680","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2013.44","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Model Driven Capacity Planning for an Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Model Driven Capacity Planning for an Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud","volume":"7","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6594736/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824242","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594736/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Model Driven Capacity Planning for an Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud","sourcePdf":"tsc-ghosh-44-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105149S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"6983668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6983668","articleId":"6594736","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6594741,"authors":[{"name":"Kasun M.

Low-power consumption is required for wireless healthcare monitoring systems since most medical sensor nodes are battery powered. The emergence of new technologies in measuring physiological signals has increased the demand for high data rate transmission systems. Ultra-wide band (UWB) is a suitable wireless technology to achieve high data rates while keeping power consumption and form factors small. Although UWB transmitters are designed based on simple techniques, UWB receivers require complex hardware and consume comparatively higher power. In order to achieve reliable low power two-way communication, a sensor node can be constructed using a UWB transmitter and a narrow band receiver. This paper proposes a new medium access control (MAC) protocol based on a dual-band physical layer technology. Co-simulation models based on MATLAB and OPNET have been developed to analyze the performance of the proposed MAC protocol. We analyzed the performance of the MAC protocol for a realistic scenario where both implantable and wearable sensor nodes are involved in the data transmission. Priority-based packet transmission techniques have been used in the MAC protocol to serve different sensors according to their QoS requirements. Analysis is done with regard to important network parameters, such as packet loss ratio, packet delay, percentage throughput, and power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2013.120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6848872","startPage":"1829","endPage":"1842","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/6848872/06594741.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2013.120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Efficient Ultra Wide Band Based Wireless Body Area Networks with Narrowband Feedback Path","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Media Access Protocol","Transmitters","Narrowband","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","body area networks","body sensor networks","health care","packet radio networks","power consumption","quality of service","radio receivers","radio transmitters","telecommunication power management","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless body area network","narrowband feedback path","wireless healthcare monitoring system","physiological signals","remote location","battery powered medical sensor nodes","data rate transmission system","UWB transmitter","power consumption","ultra wide band receiver","narrow band receiver","medium access control protocol","MAC protocol","data transmission","packet transmission technique","QoS","quality of service","co-simulation model","dual-band physical layer technology","two-way communication","on-body sensor nodes","power efficient networks","WBAN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless communication","Applications"]},{"kwd":["Wireless communication","MAC","ultra wide band","wireless body area networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Power Efficient Ultra Wide Band Based Wireless Body Area Networks with Narrowband Feedback Path","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594741/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6594741/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14429469","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Efficient Ultra Wide Band Based Wireless Body Area Networks with Narrowband Feedback Path","sourcePdf":"tmc-thotahewa-120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095376S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6848872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6848872","articleId":"6594741","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6594742,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyi Huang","affiliation":["Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Network Security and Cryptology, Fujian Normal University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6828815/6594742/6594742-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinyi Huang received the PhD degree from the School of Computer Science and Software Engineering, University of Wollongong, Australia, in 2009.

Smart-card-based password authentication is one of the most commonly used security mechanisms to determine the identity of a remote client, who must hold a valid smart card and the corresponding password to carry out a successful authentication with the server. The authentication is usually integrated with a key establishment protocol and yields smart-card-based password-authenticated key agreement. Using two recently proposed protocols as case studies, we demonstrate two new types of adversaries with smart card: 1) adversaries with pre-computed data stored in the smart card, and 2) adversaries with different data (with respect to different time slots) stored in the smart card. These threats, though realistic in distributed systems, have never been studied in the literature. In addition to point out the vulnerabilities, we propose the countermeasures to thwart the security threats and secure the protocols.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2013.230","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6828815/06594742.pdf","startPage":"1767","endPage":"1775","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2013.230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6828815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Further Observations on Smart-Card-Based Password-Authenticated Key Agreement in Distributed Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6594742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594742/","displayDocTitle":"Further Observations on Smart-Card-Based Password-Authenticated Key Agreement in Distributed Systems","volume":"25","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14396651","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6594742/","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Further Observations on Smart-Card-Based Password-Authenticated Key Agreement in Distributed Systems","sourcePdf":"tpds-xiang-230-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074344S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6828815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6828815","articleId":"6594742","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6594782,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Sheng Soh","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6672059/6594782/6594782-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Sheng Soh (S'12) received the B.A. degree in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge, U.K., in 2011.

Femtocell networks have been recently proposed as an efficient and cost-effective approach to provide unprecedented levels of network capacity and coverage. However, the dense and random deployment of femtocells and their uncoordinated operation raise important questions concerning interference pollution and spectrum allocation. Motivated by the flexible subchannel allocation capabilities of cognitive radio, we propose a cognitive hybrid division duplex (CHDD) that is suitable for heterogeneous networks in future mobile communication systems. Specifically, our CHDD scheme has a pair of frequency bands to perform frequency division duplex (FDD) on the macrocell, while time division duplex (TDD) is simultaneously operated in these bands by underlaid cognitive femtocells. By doing so, the proposed CHDD scheme exploits the advantages of both FDD and TDD schemes: operating in FDD at the macrocell tier controls inter-tier interference, whereas operating in TDD at the femtocell tier provides to femtocells the flexibility of adjusting uplink and downlink rates together with opportunistic access benefits. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we provide a methodology on how to design efficient switching mechanisms for cognitive TDD operation of femtocells. In particular, we derive closed-form expressions for the success probability and the area spectral efficiency of the proposed CHDD scheme when the macro tier is in downlink and uplink mode. Furthermore, we propose an open access policy as a means to improve the performance of macrocell transmissions. Our analysis and numerical results show the effectiveness of introducing cognition in femtocells so as to improve the system performance of two-tier femtocell networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6672059/06594782.pdf","startPage":"4852","endPage":"4865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.090313.121264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.090313.121264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6594782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Hybrid Division Duplex for Two-Tier Femtocell Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Macrocell networks","Interference","Uplink","Downlink","Femtocell networks","Radio frequency","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","femtocellular radio","radio links","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive hybrid division duplex","two-tier femtocell network","wireless device","cellular network capacity","interference pollution","spectrum allocation","flexible subchannel allocation capability","cognitive radio","CHDD scheme","heterogeneous network","frequency division duplex","FDD scheme","macrocell","time division duplex","intertier interference","uplink rate","downlink rate","opportunistic access benefit","stochastic geometry","closed-form expression","TDD scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell network","cognitive radio","frequency division duplex","time division duplex","stochastic geometry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Hybrid Division Duplex for Two-Tier Femtocell Networks","volume":"12","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6594782/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13918172","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Hybrid Division Duplex for Two-Tier Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"4852-tw1310-soh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108725S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6672059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6672059","articleId":"6594782","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6594784,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Zhao","affiliation":["Changzhou Institute of Dalian University of Technology, Changzhou, Jiangsu, P.

However, in traditional IA schemes, the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) may significantly degrade, and the quality of service (QoS) may be unacceptable. In this paper, a novel IA scheme based on antenna switching (AS-IA) is proposed to improve the SINR of the received signal while guaranteeing the QoS in IA wireless networks. In the proposed scheme, some of the antennas are replaced by reconfigurable ones that can switch among preset modes, and the best channel coefficients are selected. Furthermore, to reduce the computational complexity, a sequential antenna switching IA (SAS-IA) scheme is proposed with only one antenna switching in each time slot, and the communication proceeds during the process of searching for the optimal solution. To further improve the performance of the SAS-IA scheme under imperfect channel state information (CSI), a filtering SAS-IA scheme is proposed through averaging the estimated CSI during the iterations of the distributed IA algorithm. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed schemes in improving the QoS of IA wireless networks.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.090413.121731","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6672059/06594784.pdf","startPage":"5008","endPage":"5021","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.090413.121731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Interference Alignment Scheme Based on Sequential Antenna Switching in Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6594784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594784/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Interference Alignment Scheme Based on Sequential Antenna Switching in Wireless Networks","volume":"12","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13918180","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6594784/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Interference Alignment Scheme Based on Sequential Antenna Switching in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"5008-tw1310-zhao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107853S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6672059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6672059","articleId":"6594784","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6594786,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengyu Zhang","affiliation":["Personal Communication Network and Spread Spectrum (PCN&SS) Laboratory, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6672059/6594786/6594786-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhengyu Zhang was born in 1985.

With the objective of minimizing the average mean-squared-error of symbol estimations, we propose a novel progressive retransmission precoder by employing matrix diagonalization and channel pairing. As a consequence, we formulate the precoder design as a joint source/relay power allocation (PA) and channel pairing optimization problem. First, we propose the globally optimal solution, in which exhaustive search is employed for the channel pairing, while with each given channel pairing, an optimal PA algorithm is proposed to solve the nonconvex PA problem by utilizing the necessary conditions for optimality. However, the optimal channel pairing and PA solution is of very high complexity. In order to reduce the complexity, we then propose a suboptimal PA algorithm by iteratively optimizing the PA at the source and the relay, as well as a simplified channel pairing searching method based on the asymptotic optimal solution. It is shown that our proposed robust retransmission precoder improves the system performance significantly, meanwhile, the performance degradation of the low complexity PA and channel pairing algorithm is slight as compared to the optimal PA algorithm and the optimal channel pairing method.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.090313.130090","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6672059/06594786.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.090313.130090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672059","startPage":"5236","endPage":"5247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust ARQ Precoder Optimization for AF MIMO Relay Systems with Channel Estimation Errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6594786","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust ARQ Precoder Optimization for AF MIMO Relay Systems with Channel Estimation Errors","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594786/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13918187","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6594786/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust ARQ Precoder Optimization for AF MIMO Relay Systems with Channel Estimation Errors","sourcePdf":"5236-tw1310-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085148S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6672059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6672059","articleId":"6594786","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6594788,"authors":[{"name":"Xianjun Yang","affiliation":["Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6672059/6594788/6594788-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xianjun Yang received her B.E. degree in Communication Engineering from Yantai University, China, in 2008, and joined a combined Master/PhD program in Telecommunications at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2008, and joined a Cotutelle (joint PhD) degree program in Macquarie University (Sydney, Australia) cooperated with BUPT in 2012.

Since power consumption is one of the most critical factors that affect the lifetime of WSNs, the energy efficiency of DDS in WSNs is investigated in this paper. Based on Compressed Sensing (CS) and network coding theories, we propose a Compressed Network Coding based Distributed data Storage (CNCDS) scheme by exploiting the correlation of sensor readings. The CNCDS scheme achieves high energy efficiency by reducing the total number of transmissions Nttot and receptions Nrtot during the data dissemination process. Theoretical analysis proves that the CNCDS scheme guarantees good CS recovery performance. In order to theoretically verify the efficiency of the CNCDS scheme, the expressions for Nt\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tot</sub>\n and Nr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tot</sub>\n are derived based on random geometric graphs (RGG) theory. Furthermore, based on the derived expressions, an adaptive CNCDS scheme is proposed to further reduce Nttot and Nrtot. Simulation results validate that, compared with the conventional ICStorage scheme, the proposed CNCDS scheme reduces Nt\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tot</sub>\n, Nr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tot</sub>\n, and the CS recovery mean squared error (MSE) by up to 55%, 74%, and 76% respectively.

Unlike many existing works that merely claim that the CSS problem is NP-hard and then turn to heuristic methods, we analyze this problem under a solid discrete-convex framework. After formulating the CSS problem as a nonlinear binary programming problem, we adopt a three-step approach to solve it. In the first step, the number of SUs assigned to sense each PU channel is determined with the M/M^natural-convex theory. Based on the results obtained in the first step, we then find the SU assignment using the L/L^natural-convex theory in the second step. In the last step, the optimal number of SUs participating in sensing is obtained based on the SU assignment obtained in step two. By combining these three steps, a complete and efficient SU assignment scheme is obtained. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of our proposed SU assignment scheme and validate the theoretical analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594790/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","volume":"12","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"13918201","publicationDate":"October 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6594790/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Cooperative Sensing Scheduling for Multi-Band Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Cooperative Sensing Scheduling for Multi-Band Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"4943-tw1310-sun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123783S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6672059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6672059","articleId":"6594790","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6594793,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaotian Zhou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6672059/6594793/6594793-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaotian Zhou (S'09-M'13) received his B.S. degree in Electrical Information Engineering and the Ph.D degree in Communication and Information Systems, both from Shandong University, China, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.

The BER performance can be improved by adopting the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme. In this paper, we propose a coherent binary polarization shift keying (BPOLSK) modulation scheme with MIMO employing maximum ratio combining and equal gain combining diversity techniques to mitigate the turbulence effect. The gamma-gamma statistical channel model is adopted for all the turbulence regimes. The BER performance for the proposed BPOLSK-MIMO FSO link is compared with the single-input single-output and ON-OFF-keying systems by means of computer simulation. The optical power gain is investigated and demonstrated under different turbulence regimes for a number of transmitters/receivers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.15,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594801/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","volume":"31","issue":"20","accessionNumber":"13795004","publicationDate":"Oct.15, 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6594801/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coherent Polarization Modulated Transmission through MIMO Atmospheric Optical Turbulence Channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coherent Polarization Modulated Transmission through MIMO Atmospheric Optical Turbulence Channel","sourcePdf":"jlt-tang-2281216-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11978S","chronDate":"Oct.15,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6605568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6605568","articleId":"6594801","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6594809,"authors":[{"name":"Dongsoo Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Dongsoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37716474100"},{"name":"Xuanyao Fong","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Xuanyao","lastName":"Fong","id":"37542410100"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274519700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6594809","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1167},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6594809","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Read only memory","Random access memory","Transistors","Sensors","Capacitance","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","embedded systems","magnetic tunnelling","MRAM devices","read-only storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["R-MRAM","ROM-embedded STT MRAM cache","spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory","STT MRAM bit-cell","read-only memory","ROM functionality","bit-line","ROM data","magnetic tunnel junction","RAM-mode operations","MTJ state","read current source","sense amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cache design","read-only memory (ROM)","ROM-embedded STT MRAM","spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT MRAM)"]}],"abstract":"We present a new spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT MRAM) bit-cell that is embedded with read-only memory (ROM) functionality.

In this paper, a practical method named adaptive robust control with extended state observer (ESO) is synthesized for high-accuracy motion control of a dc motor. The proposed controller accounts for not only the structured uncertainties (i.e., parametric uncertainties) but also the unstructured uncertainties (i.e., nonlinear friction, external disturbances, and/or unmodeled dynamics). Adaptive control for the structured uncertainty and ESO for the unstructured uncertainty are designed for compensating them respectively and integrated together via a feedforward cancellation technique. The global robustness of the controller is guaranteed by a feedback robust law. Furthermore, the controller theoretically guarantees a prescribed tracking performance in the presence of various uncertainties, which is very important for high-accuracy control of motion systems. Extensive comparative experimental results are obtained to verify the high-performance nature of the proposed control strategy.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2281165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6730700","startPage":"3630","endPage":"3637","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6730700/06594810.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Robust Control of DC Motors With Extended State Observer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6594810/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Robust Control of DC Motors With Extended State Observer","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14064581","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Robust Control of DC Motors With Extended State Observer","sourcePdf":"tie-yao-2281165-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075204S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6730700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"281","xplore-issue":"6730700","articleId":"6594810","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6594811,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Gaussens","affiliation":["Syst\u00e8mes et Applications des Technologies de l'Information et de l'Energie, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan/Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique/Universit\u00e9 Paris Sud, Cachan, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6690243/6594811/6594811-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Benjamin Gaussens (S'11) was born in Toulouse, France, in 1987.

However, the contrast of the reconstructed image could be quite low. A number of reversing-based VCSs (or VCSs with reversing) (RVCS) have been proposed for binary secret images, allowing participants to perform a reversing operation on shares (or shadows). This reversing operation can be easily implemented by current copy machines. Some existing traditional VCS schemes without reversing (nRVCS) can be extended to RVCS with the same pixel expansion for binary image, and the RVCS can achieve ideal contrast, significantly higher than that of the corresponding nRVCS. In the application of grayscale VCS, the contrast is much lower than that of the binary cases. Therefore, it is more desirable to improve the contrast in the grayscale image reconstruction. However, when grayscale images are involved, one cannot take advantage of this reversing operation so easily. Many existing grayscale nRVCS cannot be directly extended to RVCS. In this paper, we first give a new grayscale nRVCS with minimum pixel expansion and propose an optimal-contrast grayscale RVCS (GRVCS) by using basis matrices of perfect black nRVCS. Also, we propose an optimal GRVCS even though the basis matrices are not perfectly black. Finally, we design an optimal-contrast GRVCS with a minimum number of shares held by each participant. The proposed schemes can satisfy different user requirements; previous RVCSs for binary images can be viewed as special cases in the schemes proposed here.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594814/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6594814/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13887970","volume":"8","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Contrast Grayscale Visual Cryptography Schemes With Reversing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Contrast Grayscale Visual Cryptography Schemes With Reversing","sourcePdf":"tifs-daoshun-2281108-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161602S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6656843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6656843","articleId":"6594814","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6594824,"authors":[{"name":"Raju Mandapati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Raju","lastName":"Mandapati","id":"38549691300"},{"name":"Abhijit Shripat Borkar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Abhijit Shripat","lastName":"Borkar","id":"38552080400"},{"name":"V.

In this paper, we study the array circuit performance during memory operations and present five interesting insights. First, power consumption minimization during set/reset operation produces the dominant constraint that defines selector/memory pairing, and consequently the cross-point nonlinearity, i.e., ON-OFF current ratio (KI). Second, an optimal KI exists (e.g., 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup>\n for 1-M array size), which implies that excessively higher KI degrades performance. Third, parallel read operation (i.e., N bits/read) can be performed and N increases with higher resistance in low-resistance state (RLRS) without compromising read margin (RM). Fourth, higher resistance ratio improves RM. Finally, read circuit with an improved sensitivity is highly attractive as 2\u00d7 lesser RM requirement can improve parallel read capability by 10\u00d7.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2013.2279553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/6605590/06594824.pdf","startPage":"3385","endPage":"3392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2013.2279553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605590","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Impact of n-p-n Selector-Based Bipolar RRAM Cross-Point on Array Performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of n-p-n Selector-Based Bipolar RRAM Cross-Point on Array Performance","volume":"60","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13794809","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6594824/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594824/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of n-p-n Selector-Based Bipolar RRAM Cross-Point on Array Performance","sourcePdf":"ted-mandapati-2279553-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093016S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6605590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6605590","articleId":"6594824","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6594827,"authors":[{"name":"Adeel Zaheer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6730700/6594827/6594827-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Adeel Zaheer (S'12) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan, in 2007.

A four conductor single phase track topology is used here as primary. Both the pads discussed in this paper have already been shown to perform well in lumped IPT systems and hence the work presented in this paper highlights and validates the possibility of using these pads in mixed distributed/lumped IPT systems. A 3-D finite element modeling tool is used to evaluate and compare all the models presented in this paper. To validate these results, a prototype system is built with a BPP secondary driving a load through a controller circuit.

Scattered point data, which are unordered sets of point coordinates with associated measured values, arise in many contexts, such as scientific experiments, sensor networks, and numerical simulations. In this paper, we present a method for visualizing such scattered point data sets. Our method is based on volume ray casting, and distinguishes itself by operating directly on the unstructured samples, rather than resampling them to form voxels. We estimate the intensity of the volume at points along the rays by interpolation using nearby samples, taking advantage of an octree to facilitate efficient range search. The method has been implemented on multi-core CPUs, GPUs as well as multi-GPU systems.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n To test our method, actual X-ray diffraction data sets have been used, consisting of up to 240 million data points.

The resonance can be excited by system harmonics either from the PWM process or from the grid voltage distortions and hence results in the line current distorted. In this paper, feedback controls using different variables in the LC filter are first investigated and comprehensively analyzed. It is shown that the inductor-voltage feedback or the capacitor-voltage feedback can damp the current oscillations by increasing the damping ratio, while the inductor-current feedback or the capacitor-current feedback is able to suppress low-order harmonics by raising the resonance frequency. On this basis, a group of combined variable feedback control methods is presented by combining the feedbacks of the inductor/capacitor current and the inductor/capacitor voltage. Thus, not only the current oscillations can be damped, but also the low-order harmonics can be suppressed. Therefore, the line current waveform is improved, and the system performance can be flexibly optimized. A practical design method for feedback gains is also presented in this paper. Finally, the simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility and validity of the proposition.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6730700","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2281173","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6730700/06594835.pdf","startPage":"3146","endPage":"3154","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2281173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resonance Damping and Harmonic Suppression for Grid-Connected Current-Source Converter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"Resonance Damping and Harmonic Suppression for Grid-Connected Current-Source Converter","volume":"61","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6594835/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14064596","dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594835/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonance Damping and Harmonic Suppression for Grid-Connected Current-Source Converter","sourcePdf":"tie-bai-2281173-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069633S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6730700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6730700","articleId":"6594835","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6594841,"authors":[{"name":"Mutlu Boztepe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6730700/6594841/6594841-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mutlu Boztepe (M'12) received the B.Sc. degree from Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University, Izmir, Turkey, in 1991, and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Ege University, Izmir, in 1995 and 2002, respectively.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ege University.

The goal of the bionanosensor network is to detect and remove a target signal that appears in the monitoring area and propagates via Brownian motion. The problem considered in this paper is formulated as a nanomachine placement problem to minimize the mean residence time of the target signals, this being defined as the average amount of time that a target signal spends in the monitoring area. We first formulate the nanomachine placement problem, and then design three simple biologically implementable approaches and one heuristic approach for the placement of nanomachines, respectively, called random, proportional, regular, and greedy placements. In the random placement, nanomachines are distributed randomly over the monitoring area. In the proportional placement, more nanomachines are distributed over the monitoring area where the target signals appear more frequently. In the regular placement, nanomachines are distributed to maintain a specific distance from adjacent nanomachines. In the greedy placement, nanomachines are optimally placed one by one. We evaluate the four approaches through simulation in terms of the mean residence time under various scenarios. We also analyze the mean residence time under a simplified setting with respect to the size of the area and number of nanomachines to be placed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6650036/06594850.pdf","startPage":"218","endPage":"227","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2281220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2281220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6650036","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6594850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributing Nanomachines for Minimizing Mean Residence Time of Molecular Signals in Bionanosensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nanobioscience","Monitoring","Sensors","Biological system modeling","Wireless sensor networks","Nanoscale devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biosensors","minimisation","nanosensors","nanotechnology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nanomachine distribution","mean residence time","molecular signal","bionanosensor network","nano-to-microscale nanomachine","Brownian motion","nanomachine placement","monitoring area","greedy placement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nanonetworks","bionanosensors","molecular communication","sensor placement","Brownian motion","first passage time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Distributing Nanomachines for Minimizing Mean Residence Time of Molecular Signals in Bionanosensor Networks","volume":"14","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13875770","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributing Nanomachines for Minimizing Mean Residence Time of Molecular Signals in Bionanosensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-nakano-2281220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089529S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","isNumber":"6650036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"13","articleId":"6594850","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6594854,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhui Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Technology, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6730700/6594854/6594854-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinhui Zhang was born in Hebei Province, China, in 1982.

The experimental results indicated that the proposed method was able to achieve a comparatively good performance in urban main road extraction.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2013.2279034","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/6678086/06594858.pdf","startPage":"788","endPage":"792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2013.2279034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6678086","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6594858","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification and Shape Features for Urban Road Centerline Extraction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification and Shape Features for Urban Road Centerline Extraction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594858/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6594858/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2013","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"13952122","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification and Shape Features for Urban Road Centerline Extraction","sourcePdf":"lgrs-miao-2279034-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06663S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6678086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6678086","articleId":"6594858","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":6594881,"authors":[{"name":"Tomas Bryllert","affiliation":["Terahertz and Millimetre Wave Laboratory, Department of Microtechnology and Nanoscience, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteborg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6617737/6594881/6594881-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tomas Bryllert (A'09\u2013M'13) was born in V\u00e4xj\u00f6, Sweden, in 1974.

Two circuits are used in a balanced configuration to improve the noise performance. The output power is > 3 dBm over a 40-GHz bandwidth (BW) centered at 220 GHz, and the receiver function is characterized by a typical mixer conversion loss of 16 dB. We present radar images at 4-m target distance with up to 60-dB dynamic range using a 30-\u03bcs chirp time, and near-BW-limited range resolution.

Previous work has demonstrated that chaos-based coded modulations could be robust in the flat fading channel. This paper illustrates that, as the flat fading channel quality degrades, parallel concatenated chaos-based coded modulations can provide better error performance than non-chaotic counterparts. Therefore, this joint coding and modulation approach may contribute to power saving in common adverse channel conditions. Moreover, it is shown that it is possible to manage its spectral efficiency while keeping its robustness under fading.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6722960/06594896.pdf","startPage":"530","endPage":"541","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2278349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2278349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6722960","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6594896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaos-Based Turbo Systems in Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Iterative decoding","Decoding","Encoding","Chaotic communication","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","fading channels","radio networks","signal processing","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Chaos based turbo systems","ubiquitous wireless communication services","signal degradation","air interface","chaos based coded modulations","flat fading channel","parallel concatenated chaos","joint coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chaos","concatenated coding","error analysis","iterative decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Chaos-Based Turbo Systems in Fading Channels","volume":"61","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6594896/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14056333","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaos-Based Turbo Systems in Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tcsi-escribano-2278349-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102344S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6722960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6722960","articleId":"6594896","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6594910,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Endres","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/6730969/6594910/6594910-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Felix Endres received the Master degree in applied computer science from the University of Freiburg, Freiburg Germany, where, since 2009, he has been working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Autonomous Intelligent Systems Lab headed by W.

In standardized wireless systems, modulation classification can be performed through exhaustive search of known signal features. Most commonly used classifiers are based on the detection of cyclostationary features, which are second-order moments of a signal, related to its carrier and symbol rate. However, when the signal parameters are unknown, an exhaustive search for cyclostationary features is energy inefficient due to high computational complexity. In this paper, we present a reconfigurable processor architecture that can blindly classify any linearly modulated signal (M-QAM, M-PSK, M-ASK, and GMSK) in addition to multi-carrier signals and spread spectrum signals. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, we analyze the complexity tradeoffs among different dependent signal processing kernels in order to minimize the total processing time and energy. Second, we optimize the processor architecture by the co-design methodology to enhance block reusability and reconfigurability. The proposed processor has been verified and synthesized in a 40-nm CMOS technology with core area of 0.06 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and power dissipation of 10 mW under 0.9 V supply voltage at 500 MHz. Under a 500 MHz wide-band signal at 10 dB SNR, a complete blind classification process consumes 10.37 \u03bcJ to meet 95% of classification accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594921/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","volume":"61","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"14056322","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6594921/","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Processor for Blind Signal Classification in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Processor for Blind Signal Classification in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tcsi-rebeiz-2278392-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099896S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6722960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6722960","articleId":"6594921","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6594925,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamed Chaouch","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Reading, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Mohamed Chaouch received the M.Sc. degree in biostatistics from University of Montpellier II, France, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from University of Burgundy, France, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.","After working as a Research Engineer in Statistics at EDF R&D, he joined the University of Reading, U.K., where he is currently a Research Associate.

Furthermore, in the last few years, many countries are interested in renewable energies such as solar and wind. Renewable energy resources are mainly used for environmental and economic reasons such as reducing the carbon emission. It might also be used to reinforce the electric network especially during high peak periods. However, the injection of such energy resources in the low-voltage (LV) network can leads to high voltage constrains. To overcome this issue, one can motivate customers to use thermal or electric storage devices during high-production periods of PV to foster the integration of renewable energy generation into the network. In this paper, we are interested in forecasting household-level electricity demand which represents a key factor to assure the balance supply/demand in the LV network. A novel methodology able to improve short term functional time series forecasts has been introduced. An application to the Irish smart meter data set showed the performance of the proposed methodology to forecast the intra-day household level load curves.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2013.2277171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6693741/06594925.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2013.2277171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6693741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering-Based Improvement of Nonparametric Functional Time Series Forecasting: Application to Intra-Day Household-Level Load Curves","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6594925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6594925/","displayDocTitle":"Clustering-Based Improvement of Nonparametric Functional Time Series Forecasting: Application to Intra-Day Household-Level Load Curves","volume":"5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13998185","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6594925/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering-Based Improvement of Nonparametric Functional Time Series Forecasting: Application to Intra-Day Household-Level Load Curves","sourcePdf":"tsg-chaouch-2277171-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076746S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6693741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"6693741","articleId":"6594925","onlineDate":"09 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6595017,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Wei Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Zhongli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Jin-Wei Shi was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan on January 22, 1976.

Furthermore, the spatial hole burning effect induced low-frequency roll off can also be minimized in our optimized structure to obtain a maximum data rate up to 26 Gbit/s.

Therefore, a biviscosity model is proposed to describe this squeeze-mode MR damper. In addition, genetic-algorithm-based optimization is used to evaluate the parameters of the system. To reduce the vibration of the structure, a semiactive fuzzy controller using the MR damper is presented for the structure vibration at various frequencies.

In the first trial, 41 superchannels with digital Nyquist pulse-shaping were generated and tightly packed to fill up both C-band and L-band. Each subcarrier was modulated with 24.8-Gbaud dual-polarization 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (DP-16QAM) data. The signal carrying net 54.2 Tb/s data was transmitted over 634 km of dispersion uncompensated field-installed standard single mode fiber with the aid of hybrid EDFA and Raman amplification and digital coherent detection. In the second trial for long-haul distances, we extended the transmission distance over 1,822 km. This increase in reach was achieved by reducing the net total capacity to 40.5 Tb/s and modulating the signals with dual-polarization 8 quadrature amplitude modulation (DP-8QAM) Nyquist carrier modulation. A novel rate-adaptive low-density parity-check coding was employed, so that the transmitted channels can exhibit different code rates, adapted by the concatenation of hard-decision and soft-decision forward error correcting codes for enhancing error-correction capability. To the best of our knowledge, we achieved the highest field trial capacity to date at 54.2 Tb/s in regional distances. Furthermore, in long-haul applications, the reported capacity \u00d7 distance product of 73.79 Pb/s\u00b7km is the highest to date.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2280396","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6701330/06595033.pdf","startPage":"776","endPage":"782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2280396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701330","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Terabit/s Nyquist Superchannels in High Capacity Fiber Field Trials Using DP-16QAM and DP-8QAM Modulation Formats","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595033/","displayDocTitle":"Terabit/s Nyquist Superchannels in High Capacity Fiber Field Trials Using DP-16QAM and DP-8QAM Modulation Formats","volume":"32","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14021120","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595033/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Terabit/s Nyquist Superchannels in High Capacity Fiber Field Trials Using DP-16QAM and DP-8QAM Modulation Formats","sourcePdf":"jlt-huang-2280396-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087056S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6701330","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6701330","articleId":"6595033","onlineDate":"10 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6595045,"authors":[{"name":"Valeria Arlunno","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Valeria","lastName":"Arlunno","id":"37708256300"},{"name":"Antonio Caballero","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Caballero","id":"37318946900"},{"name":"Robert Borkowski","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Borkowski","id":"37708257300"},{"name":"Darko Zibar","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Darko","lastName":"Zibar","id":"37269751000"},{"name":"Knud J.

The core component of such systems is the power supply, which is usually composed of a rectifier stage and a resonant inverter. In order to simplify and further optimize the performance of the power supply, a class-E direct ac-ac converter featuring multicycle modulations is proposed in this paper. The proposed converter is composed of two switching devices that enable the direct ac-ac conversion. Single- and multicycle operation modes have been analytically described to prove the benefits, in terms of peak voltage reduction and output power control capabilities. A prototype featuring SiC junction-gate field-effect transistor devices, which perfectly fit these applications, has been designed and built to prove the feasibility of the proposed converter. The experimental results match the analytical results and validate the benefits of this converter.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2281164","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6637065/06595049.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6637065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2281164","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","startPage":"2521","endPage":"2530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Class-E Direct AC\u2013AC Converter With Multicycle Modulation for Induction Heating Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Class-E Direct AC\u2013AC Converter With Multicycle Modulation for Induction Heating Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595049/","volume":"61","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6595049/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"13849458","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Class-E Direct AC\u2013AC Converter With Multicycle Modulation for Induction Heating Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-sarnago-2281164-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126066S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6637065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6637065","articleId":"6595049","onlineDate":"10 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6595052,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyi Li","affiliation":["College of Engineering, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6832663/6595052/li-2279534-small.gif","p":["Hongyi Li (M'13) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from Bohai University, Jinzhou, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D degree in intelligent control from the University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, U.K., in 2012.","He is currently a Professor at the College of Engineering, Bohai University.

This LP decoder can be used to decode error-correcting codes at bit-error-rates comparable to state-of-the-art belief propagation (BP) decoders, but with significantly stronger theoretical guarantees. However, LP decoding when implemented with standard LP solvers does not easily scale to the block lengths of modern error correcting codes. In this paper, we draw on decomposition methods from optimization theory, specifically the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), to develop efficient distributed algorithms for LP decoding. The key enabling technical result is a \u201ctwo-slice\u201d characterization of the parity polytope, the polytope formed by taking the convex hull of all codewords of the single parity check code. This new characterization simplifies the representation of points in the polytope. Using this simplification, we develop an efficient algorithm for Euclidean norm projection onto the parity polytope. This projection is required by the ADMM decoder and its solution allows us to use LP decoding, with all its theoretical guarantees, to decode large-scale error correcting codes efficiently. We present numerical results for LDPC codes of lengths more than 1000. The waterfall region of LP decoding is seen to initiate at a slightly higher SNR than for sum-product BP, however an error floor is not observed for LP decoding, which is not the case for BP. Our implementation of LP decoding using the ADMM executes as fast as our baseline sum-product BP decoder, is fully parallelizable, and can be seen to implement a type of message-passing with a particularly simple schedule.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2281372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2281372","startPage":"7870","endPage":"7886","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6670132/06595057.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decomposition Methods for Large Scale LP Decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595057/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Decomposition Methods for Large Scale LP Decoding","volume":"59","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13914290","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6595057/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decomposition Methods for Large Scale LP Decoding","sourcePdf":"tit-recht-2281372-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197118S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6670132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6670132","articleId":"6595057","onlineDate":"10 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6595059,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Luc\u00eda","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Communications, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6637065/6595059/6595059-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Oscar Luc\u00eda (S'04\u2013M'11) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain, in 2006 and 2010, respectively.","He is with the Department of Electronic Engineering and Communications at the University of Zaragoza, Spain, where he is currently an Assistant Professor.

Direct stamping lowers annealing temperature of silver nanoparticles and enhances mechanical flexibility. The directly stamped silver electrode reaches the silver nanoink's final conductivity at lower annealing temperature, 130 \u00b0C, than the As-sprayed silver electrode. And also the directly stamped silver electrodes have much lower resistance than the As sprayed one even before annealing of AgNPs. In addition, the touch sensor pads fabricated by direct stamping shows no significant decrease in sensitivity even after repeated bending stroke test at 1 Hz for 10 000 cycles. These results of mechanical stability and low annealing temperature are possible because the compressive force, which is applied to the AgNPs inside the trenches of a stamp during the direct stamping process, induces removal of pores between neighboring AgNPs, and subsequent, densification of the layers of AgNPs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6595115/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13881148","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"12","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Repeatedly Bendable Paper Touch Pad via Direct Stamping of Silver Nanoink With Pressure-Induced Low-Temperature Annealing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Repeatedly Bendable Paper Touch Pad via Direct Stamping of Silver Nanoink With Pressure-Induced Low-Temperature Annealing","sourcePdf":"tnano-kim-2281326-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055728S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6654294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6654294","articleId":"6595115","onlineDate":"10 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6595122,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Khabbazibasmenj","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6648447/6595122/6595122-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arash Khabbazibasmenj (S'08) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering (communications) from Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, and the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering (signal processing) from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in 2013.","He is currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta.

Using the principle of the worst-case performance optimization, such RAB problem leads to a difference-of-convex functions (DC) optimization problem. The existing approaches for solving the resulted non-convex DC problem are based on approximations and find only suboptimal solutions. Here, we aim at finding the globally optimal solution for the non-convex DC problem and clarify the conditions under which the solution is guaranteed to be globally optimal. Particularly, we rewrite the problem as the minimization of a one-dimensional optimal value function (OVF). Then, the OVF is replaced with another equivalent one, for which the corresponding optimization problem is convex. The new one-dimensional OVF is minimized iteratively via polynomial time DC (POTDC) algorithm. We show that the POTDC converges to a point that satisfies Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions, and such point is the global optimum under certain conditions. Towards this conclusion, we prove that the proposed algorithm finds the globally optimal solution if the presumed norm of the mismatch matrix that corresponds to the desired signal covariance matrix is sufficiently small. The new RAB method shows superior performance compared to the other state-of-the-art general-rank RAB methods.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2281301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6648447/06595122.pdf","startPage":"6103","endPage":"6117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2281301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6648447","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming for General-Rank Signal Model With Positive Semi-Definite Constraint via POTDC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595122/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming for General-Rank Signal Model With Positive Semi-Definite Constraint via POTDC","volume":"61","issue":"23","publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2013","accessionNumber":"13887027","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595122/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Adaptive Beamforming for General-Rank Signal Model With Positive Semi-Definite Constraint via POTDC","sourcePdf":"tsp-vorobyov-2281301-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165508S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2013","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6648447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6648447","articleId":"6595122","onlineDate":"10 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6595124,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Chasin","affiliation":["Interuniversitair Micro-Elektronica Centrum, Leuven, Vlaams-Brabant, BE"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6605590/6595124/6595124-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Adrian Chasin received the bachelor and master degree in electrical engineering from UFMG, Brazil and ESIEE-Paris, France, respectively, and master in nanotechnology from University of Leuven (KUL), Belgium.

In multicore systems, the locality of memory access stream is significantly reduced because of multiplexing of access streams from different running programs and hence, leakage energy-saving techniques such as decay cache, which rely on memory access locality, do not save a large amount of energy. The techniques based on way level allocation provide very coarse granularity and the techniques based on offline profiling become infeasible to use for large number of cores. We present a multicore cache energy saving technique using dynamic cache reconfiguration (MASTER) that uses online profiling to predict energy consumption of running programs at multiple LLC sizes. Using these estimates, suitable cache quotas are allocated to different programs using cache coloring scheme and the unused LLC space is turned off to save energy. Even for four core systems, the implementation overhead of MASTER is only 0.8% of L2 size. We evaluate MASTER using out-of-order simulations with multiprogrammed workloads from SPEC2006 and compare it with conventional cache leakage energy-saving techniques. The results show that MASTER gives the highest saving in energy and does not harm performance or cause unfairness. For twoand four-core simulations, the average savings in memory subsystem (which includes LLC and main memory) energy over shared baseline LLC are 15% and 11%, respectively. Also, the average values of weighted speedup and fair speedup are close to one (\u22650.98).","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2278289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6862109/06595137.pdf","startPage":"1653","endPage":"1665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2278289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6862109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MASTER: A Multicore Cache Energy-Saving Technique Using Dynamic Cache Reconfiguration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595137/","displayDocTitle":"MASTER: A Multicore Cache Energy-Saving Technique Using Dynamic Cache Reconfiguration","volume":"22","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14469470","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595137/","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-0834476 and CNS-1117604"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MASTER: A Multicore Cache Energy-Saving Technique Using Dynamic Cache Reconfiguration","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-mittal-2278289-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15503S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6862109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6862109","articleId":"6595137","onlineDate":"10 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6595138,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Hong","affiliation":["SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Tao Hong received his B.Eng. in automation from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, a M.S. in EE, a M.S. with co-majors in OR and IE, and a Ph.D. with co-majors in OR and EE from North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.","He is Senior Industry Consultant at SAS Institute, Cary, NC.

This low resolution, infrequent data can sometimes lead to inaccurate forecasts. Load forecasters often have a hard time explaining the errors based on the limited information available through the low resolution data. The increasing usage of smart grid and advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) technologies provides the utility load forecasters with high resolution, layered information to improve the load forecasting process. In this paper, we propose a modern approach that takes advantage of hourly information to create more accurate and defensible forecasts. The proposed approach has been deployed across many U.S. utilities, including a recent implementation at North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation (NCEMC), which is used as the case study in this paper. Three key elements of long term load forecasting are being modernized: predictive modeling, scenario analysis, and weather normalization.

We first consider a scenario with a single pair of source nodes, and minimum mean square error (MMSE) receiver is applied at each node. The global optimal precoding design based on the mean square error (MSE) criterion can be achieved by solving two independent convex optimization problems. To achieve a better tradeoff between performance and complexity, an alternative power optimization approach is proposed using a channel diagonalization technique. Then, we proceed to considering a more challenging bidirectional communication scenario with multiple pairs of source nodes. With intrapair coordination at the sources, we modify DNF-NC by employing a signal alignment technique to combat interpair interference. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DNF-NC schemes can significantly improve bit error rate (BER) performance in both two scenarios, and such performance gains can be achieved with relatively low computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2281330","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6739143/06595141.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2281330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6739143","startPage":"775","endPage":"788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Denoise-and-Forward Network Coding for Two-Way Relay MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Denoise-and-Forward Network Coding for Two-Way Relay MIMO Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14096878","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6595141/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Denoise-and-Forward Network Coding for Two-Way Relay MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-peng-2281330-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086868S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6739143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6739143","articleId":"6595141","onlineDate":"10 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6595144,"authors":[{"name":"Daehyun Kang","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Matawan, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6617737/6595144/6595144-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daehyun Kang received the B.S. degree in electronic and electrical engineering from Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 2012.

The impact on the nonlinearity of the cascode differential structure is studied and optimized. A proposed output transformer on the PCB minimizes the loss and enhances the efficiency of the PA. The ET on the gate of the common gate transistor is proposed to achieve high linearity and efficiency without using a digital pre-distortion technique. For a long-term evolution (LTE) signal at 1.85 GHz with a 10-MHz bandwidth and a 16QAM 7.5-dB peak-to-average power ratio, the ET CMOS PA module achieves a power-added efficiency of 34%, an error vector magnitude of 2.8%, and an adjacent channel leakage ratio of -34.2 dBc at an average output power of 26 dBm. The ET operation reduces the total current consumption by 10% to 34%, according to the power level, over that of the standalone PA for the LTE signal.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6617737/06595144.pdf","startPage":"3763","endPage":"3773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2280186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2280186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6617737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Envelope-Tracking CMOS Power Amplifier Module for LTE Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Transistors","CMOS integrated circuits","Logic gates","Linearity","Capacitance","Periodic structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Long Term Evolution","power amplifiers","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["envelope-tracking","CMOS power amplifier module","LTE applications","supply modulator","printed circuit board","long-term evolution signal","size 0.18 mum","frequency 1.85 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","efficient","envelope tracking (ET)","linear","handset","power amplifier (PA)","long-term evolution (LTE)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Envelope-Tracking CMOS Power Amplifier Module for LTE Applications","volume":"61","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6595144/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13796772","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Envelope-Tracking CMOS Power Amplifier Module for LTE Applications","sourcePdf":"tmtt-kang-2280186-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118463S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6617737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6617737","articleId":"6595144","onlineDate":"10 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6595147,"authors":[{"name":"Ozgur Inac","affiliation":["University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, US"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6617737/6595147/6595147-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ozgur Inac (S'09) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2008, the M.S degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California at San Diego (UCSD), La Jolla, CA, USA, in 2010, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at UCSD.","His research interests include RF and millimeter-wave integrated circuits in silicon technologies for phased-array systems and high data-rate wireless communications."]},"firstName":"Ozgur","lastName":"Inac","id":"37541240400"},{"name":"Fatih Golcuk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6617737/6595147/6595147-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Fatih Golcuk (S'11) received the B.S. degree in electronics and communication engineering and M.S. degree in electronics engineering from Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering at the University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.","From 2006 to 2010, he was an RF Integrated Circuit (RFIC)/Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) Design Engineer with the Hittite Microwave Corporation, Istanbul, Turkey.

This paper presents a self-start control strategy for the C-MMC-based HVDC link. The equivalent charging circuit for the uncontrolled precharging stage is derived and the behaviors of the CDSM are investigated. In addition, the selection of the current-limiting resistor is described. To fully charge the capacitors in submodules, a simple grouping sequentially controlled charge (GSCC) method is proposed. This method makes the capacitors be charged group by group so that each capacitor can share sufficient stored energy. In particular, detailed startup procedures are designed for the HVDC link under two conditions, that is, connecting to active grids and supplying the passive network. The feasibility of the GSCC scheme under cell failure conditions is discussed. The validity of the proposed strategies is verified by PSCAD/EMTDC simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Start Control With Grouping Sequentially Precharge for the C-MMC-Based HVDC System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2279106","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/6718038/06595152.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2279106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6718038","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595152","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595152/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Self-Start Control With Grouping Sequentially Precharge for the C-MMC-Based HVDC System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6595152/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14056540","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Start Control With Grouping Sequentially Precharge for the C-MMC-Based HVDC System","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-xue-2279106-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082783S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6718038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"6718038","articleId":"6595152","onlineDate":"10 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6595153,"authors":[{"name":"Emmanuel Boutillon","affiliation":["Lab-STICC Laboratory, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Bretagne, Lorient, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6609087/6595153/6595153-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emmanuel Boutillon was born in 1966 in France.

The proposed approach exploits a simple loop-shaped dual-mode resonator that is tapped and perturbed with varactor diodes to realize center frequency tunability and passband reconfigurabilty. The even- and odd-mode resonances of the resonator can be predominately controlled via the incorporated varactors, and the passband response reconfiguration is obtained with the proposed tunable external coupling mechanism, which resolves the return losses degradation attributed to conventional fixed external coupling mechanisms. The demonstrated approach leads to a relatively simple synthesis of the microwave BPF with an up to 33% center frequency tuning range, an excellent bandwidth tuning capability, as well as a high filter response reconfigurability, including an all-reject response.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6617737/06595155.pdf","startPage":"3590","endPage":"3600","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2280129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2280129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6617737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Center Frequency and Bandwidth Controllable Microstrip Bandpass Filter Design Using Loop-Shaped Dual-Mode Resonator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Bandwidth","Passband","Couplings","Band-pass filters","Varactors","Tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","microwave filters","varactors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-reject response","high filter response reconfigurability","bandwidth tuning capability","center frequency tuning range","microwave BPF synthesis","fixed external coupling mechanism","return losses degradation","tunable external coupling mechanism","passband response reconfiguration","odd-mode resonance","even-mode resonance","passband reconfigurabilty","center frequency tunability","varactor diodes","continuous control","microwave bandpass filter","loop-shaped dual-mode resonator","bandwidth controllable microstrip bandpass filter design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandpass filter (BPF)","dual mode","reconfigurable filter","tunable filter","varactor diode"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595155/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Center Frequency and Bandwidth Controllable Microstrip Bandpass Filter Design Using Loop-Shaped Dual-Mode Resonator","volume":"61","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6595155/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13796767","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Center Frequency and Bandwidth Controllable Microstrip Bandpass Filter Design Using Loop-Shaped Dual-Mode Resonator","sourcePdf":"tmtt-tsai-2280129-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.189082S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6617737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6617737","articleId":"6595155","onlineDate":"10 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6595161,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The use of subchannels, which are defined as group of subcarriers, leads to reducing the complexity of the bandwidth allocation compared with the commonly adopted subcarrier allocation. A goodput-based optimization function, which is derived by combining automatic repeat request (ARQ) and physical (PHY)-layer parameters, is used to perform RA for applications that demand error-free transmissions. Two transmission strategies are considered, with and without concatenation of subchannels, for which two different RA methods are developed, respectively. We also propose an algorithm that improves the complexity associated to both concatenation and nonconcatenation schemes, without appreciable performance loss.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2281367","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6766688/06595163.pdf","startPage":"1178","endPage":"1192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2281367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fairness-Adaptive Goodput-Based Resource Allocation in OFDMA Downlink with ARQ","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595163","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595163/","displayDocTitle":"Fairness-Adaptive Goodput-Based Resource Allocation in OFDMA Downlink with ARQ","volume":"63","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14159236","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595163/","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fairness-Adaptive Goodput-Based Resource Allocation in OFDMA Downlink with ARQ","sourcePdf":"tvt-escuderogarzas-2281367-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146523S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6766688","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6766688","articleId":"6595163","onlineDate":"10 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6595166,"authors":[{"name":"Josep F.

In conventional PET, this coincidence identification is usually carried out through a coincidence electronic unit. An accidental coincidence occurs when two photons arising from different annihilations are classified as a coincidence. Accidental coincidences are one of the main sources of image degradation in PET. Some novel systems allow coincidences to be selected post-acquisition in software, or in real time through a digital coincidence engine in an FPGA. These approaches provide the user with extra flexibility in the sorting process and allow the application of alternative coincidence sorting procedures. In this work a novel sorting procedure based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques has been developed. It has been compared to a conventional coincidence sorting algorithm based on a time coincidence window. The data have been obtained from Monte-Carlo simulations. A small animal PET scanner has been implemented to this end. The efficiency (the ratio of correct identifications) can be selected for both methods. In one case by changing the actual value of the coincidence window used, and in the other by changing a threshold at the output of the neural network. At matched efficiencies, the ANN-based method always produces a sorted output with a smaller random fraction. In addition, two differential trends are found: the conventional method presents a maximum achievable efficiency, while the ANN-based method is able to increase the efficiency up to unity, the ideal value, at the cost of increasing the random fraction. Images reconstructed using ANN sorted data (no compensation for randoms) present better contrast, and those image features which are more affected by randoms are enhanced. For the image quality phantom used in the paper, the ANN method decreases the spillover ratio by a factor of 18%.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2013.2274702","startPage":"3399","endPage":"3409","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/6594964/06595166.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2013.2274702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6594964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Artificial Neural Network for Reducing Random Coincidences in PET","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phantoms","Sorting","Artificial neural networks","Positron emission tomography","Photonics","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coincidence techniques","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","image reconstruction","medical image processing","Monte Carlo methods","neural nets","phantoms","positron emission tomography","sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PET random coincidence reduction","positron emission tomography","photon coincidence detection","positron annihilation","conventional PET","coincidence electronic unit","accidental coincidence","annihilation photon classification","PET image degradation","post-acquisition coincidence selection","software selection","real time selection","digital coincidence engine","FPGA","sorting process flexibility","alternative coincidence sorting procedure","artificial neural network technique","ANN technique","conventional coincidence sorting algorithm","time coincidence window","Monte Carlo simulation","small animal PET scanner","coincidence sorting algorithm efficiency","correct identification ratio","actual coincidence window value","neural network output threshold","ANN-based method","small random fraction","maximum achievable efficiency","image reconstruction","ANN sorted data","image contrast","image feature enhancement","image quality","phantom","spillover ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","image reconstruction","positron emission tomography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595166/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Application of Artificial Neural Network for Reducing Random Coincidences in PET","volume":"60","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6595166/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13810401","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Artificial Neural Network for Reducing Random Coincidences in PET","sourcePdf":"tns-oliver-2274702-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114223S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"6594964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6594964","articleId":"6595166","onlineDate":"10 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6595186,"authors":[{"name":"Yomna M.

Such repeated interactions, in which agents may or may not share the same preferences over outcomes, provide opportunities for the agents to adapt to each other to become more successful. Successful agents must be able to reason and learn given the dynamic behavior of others. This is challenging for artificial agents since the non-stationarity of the environment does not lend itself well to straight-forward application of traditional machine learning methods. In this paper, we study the performance of genetic algorithms (GAs) in repeated matrix games (RMGs) played against other learning agents. In so doing, we consider how particular variations in the GA affect its performance. Our results show the potential of using GAs to learn and adapt in RMGs, and highlight important characteristics of successful GAs in these games. However, the GAs we consider do not always perform effectively in RMGs. Thus, we also discuss and analyze how human input could potentially be used to improve their performance in RMGs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595186/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13766701","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595186/","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms in repeated matrix games: the effects of algorithmic modifications and human input with various associates","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms in repeated matrix games: the effects of algorithmic modifications and human input with various associates","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RP05SS0377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106856S","chronDate":"16-19 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588672","isNumber":"6595180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588672","xplore-issue":"6595180","articleId":"6595186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6595201,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This is mainly due to the constraints related with the transport crew scheduling, like inability to change crew in the intermediate points and to provide minimum rest time. There are several tools used for solving this problem, like heuristics, Mathematical programming, Knowledge-based approaches, Metaheuristics etc. Most of the commercial packages use a combination of Metaheuristics and linear programming, as evident from the literature survey. Among these, the use of Genetic Algorithm has got wide attention these days because of its power and flexibility. The major parameters considered in the above models are fleet utilization and cost of operation, whereas the uniformity of work distribution among the crew is not taken care of. The proposed model addresses this issue also, by considering a trade off between work distribution and cost of operation among a set of solutions generated by genetic algorithm. The studies with the proposed model show considerable improvement both in terms of cost and fleet utilization, thus boosting the overall financial performance of the firm. It also focuses in bringing out uniformity in work distribution among the crew.","doi":"10.1109/CIPLS.2013.6595201","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588694/6595191/06595201.pdf","startPage":"61","endPage":"69","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Production and Logistics Systems (CIPLS)","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Production and Logistics Systems (CIPLS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIPLS.2013.6595201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of crew scheduling with uniform work distribution: A new approach using genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595201/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of crew scheduling with uniform work distribution: A new approach using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13752118","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6595201/","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of crew scheduling with uniform work distribution: A new approach using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RP09SS0186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055016S","chronDate":"16-19 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588694","isNumber":"6595191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588694","xplore-issue":"6595191","articleId":"6595201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6595202,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Tummel","affiliation":["IMA, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Tummel","id":"37396384400"},{"name":"Tobias Pvttel","affiliation":["Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule Aachen, Aachen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Pvttel","id":"37087650639"},{"name":"Philipp Wolters","affiliation":["IMA, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Wolters","id":"37073916900"},{"name":"Eckart Hauck","affiliation":["IMA, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Eckart","lastName":"Hauck","id":"37601771700"},{"name":"Sabina Jeschke","affiliation":["IMA, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Sabina","lastName":"Jeschke","id":"37300097700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5905-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6595202","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Genetics","Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Vehicles","Sociology","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","genetic algorithms","logistics","mathematical operators","vehicle routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["line-based optimization","LTL-shipment","multistep genetic algorithm","cloud logistic-concept","less than truck load shipment","cooperation network","heuristical approach","multiobjective optimization problem","NP-hard","multidepot heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem","time window","assignment restriction","m-VRPTWAR","problem-specific genetic operator","generation-based approach","usage-based approach","mutation process","problem-specific crossover operator","genetic multistep approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","m-VRPTWAR","multi-objective","multi-step","LTL","generation-based","usage-based","Cloud Logistic"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595202","abstract":"Motivated by the so-called \u201cCloud Logistic\u201d-concept as an innovative, line-based way for dealing with less than truck load (LTL) shipments in cooperation networks, this paper introduces a genetic algorithm as a heuristical approach for dealing with multi-objective optimization problems.

In this sense, our work aims to investigate whether the prioritization of instances of three types of classical code anomalies, Divergent Change, God Class and Shotgun Surgery, can be improved when supported by architecture blueprints. These blueprints are informal models often available in software projects, and they are used to capture key architecture decisions. Moreover, we are also investigating what information may be useful in the design blueprints to help developers on prioritizing the most critical software anomalies. In many cases, developers indicated that it would be interesting the insertion of additional information on the blueprints in order to detect architecturally-relevant anomalies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prioritizing software anomalies with software metrics and architecture blueprints","publicationTitle":"2013 5th International Workshop on Modeling in Software Engineering (MiSE)","doi":"10.1109/MiSE.2013.6595301","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 5th International Workshop on Modeling in Software Engineering (MiSE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588674/6595284/06595301.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MiSE.2013.6595301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595284","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Prioritizing software anomalies with software metrics and architecture blueprints","conferenceDate":"18-19 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595301/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13766833","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prioritizing software anomalies with software metrics and architecture blueprints","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"p82guimaraes.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072231S","chronDate":"18-19 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588674","isNumber":"6595284","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588674","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6595284","articleId":"6595301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-02"},{"_id":6595320,"authors":[{"name":"Seyyed Mojtaba Ahmadi","affiliation":["Department Of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyyed Mojtaba","lastName":"Ahmadi","id":"37073933400"},{"name":"Behrooz Masoumi","affiliation":["Department Of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Behrooz","lastName":"Masoumi","id":"37401745700"},{"name":"Reza Pourshaikh","affiliation":["Department Of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Qazvin, Iran"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Pourshaikh","id":"37073886900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6315-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6314-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6595320","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognition","Nonhomogeneous media","Resource management","Learning automata","Computer aided software engineering","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["case-based reasoning","grid computing","learning automata","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","grid system","collective case based reasoning method","learning automata","scheduler agent","homogeneous agent effect","inhomogeneous agent effect","ICBR-LA procedure","max-min method","min-min method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Collective Case Based Reasoning","Learning Automata","Resource Allocation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595320","abstract":"At this article, we study the solutions about resources allocation in grid systems by means of synthetic method of collective case based on reasoning and learning automata.

To discover generic spaced motifs which have multiple conserved patterns separated by wild-cards called spacers, the genetic algorithm (GA) based GASMEN has been proposed and shown to outperform related methods. However, the over-generic modeling of any number of spacers increases the optimization difficulty in practice. In protein-DNA binding case studies, complicated spaced motifs are rare while dimers with single spacers are more common spaced motifs. Moreover, errors (mismatches) in a conserved pattern are not arbitrarily distributed as certain highly conserved nucleotides are essential to maintain bindings. Motivated by better optimization in real applications, we have developed a new method, which is GA for Dimer-led and Error-restricted Spaced Motifs (GADESM). Common spaced motifs are paid special attention to using dimer-led initialization in the population initialization. The results on real datasets show that the dimer-led initialization in GADESM achieves better fitness than GASMEN with statistical significance. With additional error-restricted motif occurrence retrieval, GADESM has shown better performance than GASMEN on both comprehensive simulation data and a real ChIP-seq case study.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595409/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13766880","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595409/","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm for dimer-led and error-restricted spaced motif discovery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm for dimer-led and error-restricted spaced motif discovery","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RP29SS0028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.21332S","chronDate":"16-19 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588686","isNumber":"6595379","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588686","xplore-issue":"6595379","articleId":"6595409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6595416,"authors":[{"name":"Shen Quanhua","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering College, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shen","lastName":"Quanhua","id":"37073926500"},{"name":"Xia Fei","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering College, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Fei","id":"37073860500"},{"name":"Zhu Qianghua","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering College, Naval University of Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Qianghua","id":"37073940300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5875-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6595416","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proteins","Field programmable gate arrays","Random access memory","Arrays","Acceleration","Power demand","Bioinformatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","biological techniques","field programmable gate arrays","lab-on-a-chip","molecular configurations","parallel algorithms","proteins"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protein tertiary structure analysis","protein conformation sampling","computational problem","protein database","FPGA chips","application accelerator","bioinformatics algorithm acceleration","fine-grained custom design","fine-grained parallel hardware implementation","FPGA XC5VLX330 chip","BackboneDBN program","realistic protein conformation","local structural bias","PC platform","Intel E7400 dual-core","FPGA power consumption","general-purpose CPU"]}],"abstract":"In the era of tertiary protein structure prediction, the most successful protein structure prediction methods involve sampling protein conformations which is a computational problem due to the increasing scale of the protein database.

Here, we present a new Probability Collectives MOO algorithm, MOPC/D, based on a decomposition strategy that exploits the search operators which arise naturally from the use of a probabilistic Gaussian mixture model formulation. Evaluation of this approach, using the 2-and 3- objective unconstrained problems from the CEC2009 benchmark suite, found MOPC/D to perform competitively with the state of the art (across these problems it has the best mean rank and rank standard deviation of 14 algorithms in the CEC2009 competition, e.g. above MOEA/D), and significantly outperform the (only) previously published MOO algorithm in the PC framework.

The diversity of services provided by the cloud infrastructure increases their vulnerability to security incidents and attacks. In fact, security components such as confidentiality, privacy, authentication and availability must be respected when designing or deploying a cloud solution. The cloud is certainly an instrument for optimization but the research in this area has just taken its first impulse and it yet to be mature.

For low-speed targets, e.g., the movement of clouds, synchronization is insignificant and, depending on the application, may be disregarded. Real-time asynchronous fusion is a demanding task in sensor networks when the sensors are not synchronous in sampling-rate or in sampling-phase. In the method proposed in this paper, an estimator in the fusion center estimates the actual time of the sample with respect to the time-reference of the fusion center upon receiving the data from a sensor. Then, the computer of the fusion center uses predictions to transfer all the received data to the data corresponding to the start of the next fusion period. This process synchronizes the data, which is necessary for real-time uncorrelated track-to-track fusion. Finally, the pseudo-synchronized data of all the sensors are fused with an element-wise linear minimum variance unbiased estimator algorithm before the start of the next fusion period. Simulation and comparison with some benchmark algorithms are demonstrated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6650036","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2281394","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6650036/06595530.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"217","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2281394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Track-to-Track Fusion by Direct Estimation of Time of Sample in Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Track-to-Track Fusion by Direct Estimation of Time of Sample in Sensor Networks","volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6595530/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13875760","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595530/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Track-to-Track Fusion by Direct Estimation of Time of Sample in Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-talebi-2281394-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060132S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6650036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6650036","articleId":"6595530","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6595531,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Jun Zheng","affiliation":["Zhejiang University of Technology, College of Computer Science and Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/6725695/6595531/6595531-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Jun Zheng (M'06) received the bachelor's and master's degrees from the Academy of Armored Force Engineering, Beijing, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2010.","He is an Engineer with the Zhejiang University of Technology, Zhejiang, China.

However, real-world data of fire evacuation is often noisy, incomplete, and inconsistent, and the response time of population classification is very limited. In this paper, we propose an effective multiobjective particle swarm optimization method for population classification in fire evacuation operations, which simultaneously optimizes the precision and recall measures of the classification rules. We design an effective approach for encoding classification rules, and use a comprehensive learning strategy for evolving particles and maintaining diversity of the swarm. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method performs better than some state-of-the-art methods for classification rule mining, especially on the real-world fire evacuation dataset. This paper also reports a successful application of our method in a real-world fire evacuation operation that recently occurred in China. The method can be easily extended to many other multiobjective rule mining problems.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/6725695/06595531.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Population Classification in Fire Evacuation: A Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization Approach","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6725695","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281396","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595531/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Population Classification in Fire Evacuation: A Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization Approach","dateOfInsertion":"27 January 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14057263","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6595531/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Population Classification in Fire Evacuation: A Multiobjective Particle Swarm Optimization Approach","sourcePdf":"tevc-zheng-2281396-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.212849S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6725695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"6725695","articleId":"6595531","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6595532,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Hsiang Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6862109/6595532/peng-2278706-small.gif","p":["Chih-Hsiang Peng received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electronics Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2008, and the M.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2010.

However, during hardware implementation of the SMO algorithm, enhancing chip performance without excessively increasing chip area is often a crucial issue. The solution proposed in this paper is a novel reconfigurable and efficient chip design with SMO-based training accelerator (REC-STA). Two novel methods used in the proposed REC-STA are trimode coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (TCRA) and triple finite-state-machine with dynamic scheduling The first method modifies the baseline SMO design by developing trimode reconfigurable architectures with parallel and pipeline computing capabilities. The second method provides a schedule for efficient reconfiguration of the TCRA. Use of these methods can remove kernel cache design. For chip manufacturing, the implementation of the REC-STA is synthesized, placed, and routed using the TSMC 0.18-\u03bcm technology library. The core size is 2.94 mm \u00d7 2.94 mm and the power consumption is 77.3 mW. Compared with the baseline design, the FPGA simulation results show that the proposed architecture requires 50% less memory and 31% fewer gate counts but provides a 16-fold improvement in training performance. The experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed architecture and methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6862109/06595532.pdf","startPage":"1791","endPage":"1802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2278706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2278706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6862109","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"REC-STA: Reconfigurable and Efficient Chip Design With SMO-Based Training Accelerator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Complexity theory","Arrays","Hardware","Support vector machines","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","finite state machines","logic design","optimisation","reconfigurable architectures","sequential circuits","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["REC-STA","SMO-based training accelerator","sequential minimal optimization","Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition","learning problems","support vector machines","hardware implementation","trimode coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture","TCRA","finite-state-machine","dynamic scheduling","trimode reconfigurable architectures","pipeline computing capabilities","kernel cache design","TSMC technology library","FPGA simulation","size 0.18 mum","size 2.94 mm","power 77.3 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable computing","sequential minimal optimization (SMO)","speaker recognition","support vector machine (SVM)","trimode coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (TCRA)","triple finite-state-machine with dynamic scheduling (TFDS)","VLSI."]},{"kwd":["Reconfigurable computing","sequential minimal optimization (SMO)","speaker recognition","support vector machine (SVM)","trimode coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture (TCRA)","triple finite-state-machine with dynamic scheduling (TFDS)","VLSI"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"REC-STA: Reconfigurable and Efficient Chip Design With SMO-Based Training Accelerator","volume":"22","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6595532/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14469469","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"REC-STA: Reconfigurable and Efficient Chip Design With SMO-Based Training Accelerator","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-peng-2278706-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112179S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6862109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6862109","articleId":"6595532","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6595535,"authors":[{"name":"Keyong Han","affiliation":["Preston M.

This limit is mainly determined by two parameters: the diversity order and the coding gain. With linear precoding, full diversity on a block fading channel can be achieved without error-correcting code. However, the effect of precoding on the coding gain is not well known, mainly due to the complicated expression of the outage probability. Using a geometric approach, this paper establishes simple upper bounds on the outage probability, the minimization of which yields to precoding matrices that achieve very good performance. For discrete alphabets, it is shown that the combination of constellation expansion and precoding is sufficient to closely approach the minimum possible outage achieved by an i.i.d. Gaussian input distribution, thus essentially maximizing the coding gain.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2281418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2281418","startPage":"8250","endPage":"8266","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6670132/06595547.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding for Outage Probability Minimization on Block Fading Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Precoding for Outage Probability Minimization on Block Fading Channels","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","volume":"59","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13914283","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595547/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding for Outage Probability Minimization on Block Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-duyck-2281418-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032495S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","isNumber":"6670132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6595547","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6595549,"authors":[{"name":"Hai-Lin Liu","affiliation":["Guangdong University of Technology, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Hai-Lin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537714600"},{"name":"Fangqing Gu","affiliation":["Guangdong University of Technology, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Fangqing","lastName":"Gu","id":"37528340800"},{"name":"Qingfu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR"],"firstName":"Qingfu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37275872700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-778X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0026"}],"articleNumber":"6595549","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":391,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4936},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Sociology","Statistics","Vectors","Approximation methods","Approximation algorithms","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOP","MOEA-D-M2M","multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm-based decomposition","population diversity","classic MOEA/D","NSGA-II"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiobjective optimization","decomposition","hybrid algorithms"]},{"kwd":["Decomposition","hybrid algorithms","multiobjective optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595549","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/6821278/06595549.pdf","startPage":"450","endPage":"455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281533","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6821278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decomposition of a Multiobjective Optimization Problem Into a Number of Simple Multiobjective Subproblems","abstract":"This letter suggests an approach for decomposing a multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) into a set of simple multiobjective optimization subproblems. Using this approach, it proposes MOEA/D-M2M, a new version of multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm-based decomposition. This proposed algorithm solves these subproblems in a collaborative way. Each subproblem has its own population and receives computational effort at each generation. In such a way, population diversity can be maintained, which is critical for solving some MOPs. Experimental studies have been conducted to compare MOEA/D-M2M with classic MOEA/D and NSGA-II. This letter argues that population diversity is more important than convergence in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for dealing with some MOPs.

The massively parallel execution model has been effective to hide the long latency of off-chip memory accesses in graphics and other general computing applications exhibiting regular memory behaviors. With the fast-growing demand for general purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU), GPU workloads are becoming highly diversified, and thus requiring a synergistic coordination of both computing and memory resources to unleash the computing power of GPUs. Accordingly, recent graphics processors begin to integrate an on-die level-2 (L2) cache. The huge number of threads on GPUs, however, poses significant challenges to L2 cache design. The experiments on a variety of GPGPU applications reveal that the L2 cache may or may not improve the overall performance depending on the characteristics of applications. In this paper, we propose efficient techniques to improve GPGPU performance by orchestrating both L2 cache and memory in a unified framework. The basic philosophy is to exploit the temporal locality among the massive number of concurrent memory requests and minimize the impact of memory divergence behaviors among simultaneously executed groups of threads. Our major contributions are twofold. First, a priority-based cache management is proposed to maximize the chance of frequently revisited data to be kept in the cache. Second, an effective memory scheduling is introduced to reorder memory requests in the memory controller according to the divergence behavior for reducing average waiting time of warps. Simulation results reveal that our techniques enhance the overall performance by 10% on average for memory intensive benchmarks, whereas the maximum gain can be up to 30%.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6862109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/6862109/06595566.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2278025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2013.2278025","startPage":"1803","endPage":"1814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orchestrating Cache Management and Memory Scheduling for GPGPU Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595566/","displayDocTitle":"Orchestrating Cache Management and Memory Scheduling for GPGPU Applications","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595566/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"14469471","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orchestrating Cache Management and Memory Scheduling for GPGPU Applications","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-mu-2278025-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071914S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6862109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6862109","articleId":"6595566","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6595567,"authors":[{"name":"Himanshu Jain","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/6866949/6595567/jain-2281534-small.gif","p":["Himanshu Jain is a P.h.D student in Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.

In this paper, we extend NSGA-III to solve generic constrained many-objective optimization problems. In the process, we also suggest three types of constrained test problems that are scalable to any number of objectives and provide different types of challenges to a many-objective optimizer. A previously suggested MOEA/D algorithm is also extended to solve constrained problems. Results using constrained NSGA-III and constrained MOEA/D show an edge of the former, particularly in solving problems with a large number of objectives. Furthermore, the NSGA-III algorithm is made adaptive in updating and including new reference points on the fly. The resulting adaptive NSGA-III is shown to provide a denser representation of the Pareto-optimal front, compared to the original NSGA-III with an identical computational effort. This, and the original NSGA-III paper, together suggest and amply test a viable evolutionary many-objective optimization algorithm for handling constrained and unconstrained problems. These studies should encourage researchers to use and pay further attention in evolutionary many-objective optimization.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6866949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/6866949/06595567.pdf","startPage":"602","endPage":"622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm Using Reference-Point Based Nondominated Sorting Approach, Part II: Handling Constraints and Extending to an Adaptive Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"An Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm Using Reference-Point Based Nondominated Sorting Approach, Part II: Handling Constraints and Extending to an Adaptive Approach","volume":"18","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595567/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14485705","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595567/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization Algorithm Using Reference-Point Based Nondominated Sorting Approach, Part II: Handling Constraints and Extending to an Adaptive Approach","sourcePdf":"tevc-deb-2281534-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104018S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6866949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"580","xplore-issue":"6866949","articleId":"6595567","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6595568,"authors":[{"name":"Duckseoung Kang","affiliation":["Interuniversity Semiconductor Research Center and School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Duckseoung","lastName":"Kang"},{"name":"Kyunghwan Lee","affiliation":["Interuniversity Semiconductor Research Center and School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyunghwan","lastName":"Lee"},{"name":"Seongjun Seo","affiliation":["Interuniversity Semiconductor Research Center and School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seongjun","lastName":"Seo"},{"name":"Shinhyung Kim","affiliation":["Product Quality Assurance Team, Memory Division, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"firstName":"Shinhyung","lastName":"Kim"},{"name":"Ji-Seok Lee","affiliation":["Product Quality Assurance Team, Memory Division, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"firstName":"Ji-Seok","lastName":"Lee"},{"name":"Dong-Seok Bae","affiliation":["Product Quality Assurance Team, Memory Division, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Seok","lastName":"Bae"},{"name":"Dong Hua Li","affiliation":["Product Quality Assurance Team, Memory Division, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"firstName":"Dong Hua","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Yuchul Hwang","affiliation":["Product Quality Assurance Team, Memory Division, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Gyeonggi-Do, Korea"],"firstName":"Yuchul","lastName":"Hwang"},{"name":"Hyungcheol Shin","affiliation":["Interuniversity Semiconductor Research Center and School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyungcheol","lastName":"Shin"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6595568","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correction to \u201cGeneration Dependence of Retention Characteristics in Extremely Scaled NAND Flash Memory\u201d [Sep 13 1139-1141]","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595568","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memories","Integrated circuits","Electron traps","Tunneling"]}],"abstract":"In the above paper (ibid., vol. 34, no. 9, pp. 1139-1141, Sep. 2013), the corresponding authors are not correctly indicated.

In this letter, the missing or noisy information in Aqua MODIS band 6 is successfully completed using a robust multilinear regression (M-estimator) based on the spectral relations between working detectors in band 6 and all the other spectra. The experimental results indicate that the proposed robust M-estimator multiregression (RMEMR) algorithm can effectively complete the large areas of missing information while retaining the edges and textures, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dead Pixel Completion of Aqua MODIS Band 6 Using a Robust M-Estimator Multiregression","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2013.2278626","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/6678086/06595575.pdf","startPage":"768","endPage":"772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2013.2278626","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6678086","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595575","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595575/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Dead Pixel Completion of Aqua MODIS Band 6 Using a Robust M-Estimator Multiregression","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6595575/","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2013","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"13952119","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dead Pixel Completion of Aqua MODIS Band 6 Using a Robust M-Estimator Multiregression","sourcePdf":"lgrs-shen-2278626-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077477S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6678086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6678086","articleId":"6595575","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6595589,"authors":[{"name":"Michael D.

We derive new sampling schemes exploiting this assumption and give theoretical lower bounds on the number of measurements required to reconstruct HSI data and recover their source model parameters. This allows us to segment HSIs into their source abundance maps directly from compressed measurements. We also propose efficient optimization algorithms and perform extensive experimentation on synthetic and real datasets, which reveals that our approach can be used to encode HSI with far less measurements and computational effort than traditional compressive sensing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2013.2281405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6609090/06595593.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2013.2281405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609090","startPage":"5096","endPage":"5110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Source Separation: Theory and Methods for Hyperspectral Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Source Separation: Theory and Methods for Hyperspectral Imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595593/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13821681","pubMedId":"24043385","dateOfInsertion":"04 October 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6595593/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Source Separation: Theory and Methods for Hyperspectral Imaging","sourcePdf":"tip-golbabaee-2281405-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109566S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6609090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6609090","articleId":"6595593","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6595595,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiyong Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278570700"},{"name":"Hai-Tao Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control, School of Automation, and the State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hai-Tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293127900"},{"name":"Ming-Can Fan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control, School of Automation, and the State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ming-Can","lastName":"Fan","id":"37071533400"},{"name":"Dan Wang","affiliation":["School of Marine Engineering, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086625700"},{"name":"Dinggen Li","affiliation":["School of Energy and Power Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Dinggen","lastName":"Li","id":"37086624231"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6536"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0865"},{"format":"CD","value":"2374-0159"}],"articleNumber":"6595595","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":641},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aerospace electronics","Synchronization","Joints","Robot kinematics","Trajectory","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-robot systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiagents","bounded space","natural systems","engineering applications","flocking formulation","velocity consensus","bouncing boundaries","robots"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Collective motion","consensus","cooperative control","multiagent systems","nonholonomic vehicles."]},{"kwd":["Collective motion","consensus","cooperative control","multiagent systems","nonholonomic vehicles"]}],"abstract":"In most scenarios encountered in both natural systems and engineering applications, collective motions are always confined in a bounded space.

The microdispenser consists of two active valves and a dispenser chamber, all actuated by the volume change associated with the solid-to-liquid phase transition of paraffin wax. It is fabricated using stainless steel sheets, a flexible printed circuit board, and a polyimide membrane. All are covered with Parylene C for insulation and fusion bonding at assembly. A finite element method (FEM) model of the paraffin actuator is used to predict the resulting flow characteristics. The results show dispensing of well-defined volumes of 350 and 540 nL, with a good repeatability between dispensing sequences, as well as reproducibility between devices. In addition, the flow characteristics show no back-pressure dependence of the dispensed flow in the interval 0.5-2.0 MPa. The FEM model can be used to predict the flow characteristics qualitatively.","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2013.2279976","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/84/6781020/06595598.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2013.2279976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6781020","startPage":"452","endPage":"458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microdispenser With Continuous Flow and Selectable Target Volume for Microfluidic High-Pressure Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Microdispenser With Continuous Flow and Selectable Target Volume for Microfluidic High-Pressure Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595598/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14210090","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6595598/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microdispenser With Continuous Flow and Selectable Target Volume for Microfluidic High-Pressure Applications","sourcePdf":"jmems-boden-2279976-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056931S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"6781020","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6781020","articleId":"6595598","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6595603,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Iqbal","affiliation":["Evolutionary Computation Research Group, School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/6866949/6595603/iqbal-2281537-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Iqbal (M'11) received the master's degree in computer science from the National University of Sciences and Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, in 2008.

In the work presented here, a genetic programming like rich encoding scheme has been constructed to identify building blocks of knowledge in a learning classifier system. The fitter building blocks from the learning system trained against smaller problems have been utilized in a higher complexity problem in the domain to achieve scalable learning. The proposed system has been examined and evaluated on four different Boolean problem domains: 1) multiplexer, 2) majority-on, 3) carry, and 4) even-parity problems. The major contribution of this paper is to successfully extract useful building blocks from smaller problems and reuse them to learn more complex large-scale problems in the domain, e.g., 135-bit multiplexer problem, where the number of possible instances is 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">135</sup>\n \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">40</sup>\n, is solved by reusing the extracted knowledge from the learned lower level solutions in the domain. Autonomous scaling is, for the first time, shown to be possible in learning classifier systems. It improves effectiveness and reduces the number of training instances required in large problems, but requires more time due to its sequential build-up of knowledge.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281537","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/6866949/06595603.pdf","startPage":"465","endPage":"480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6866949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reusing Building Blocks of Extracted Knowledge to Solve Complex, Large-Scale Boolean Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595603/","displayDocTitle":"Reusing Building Blocks of Extracted Knowledge to Solve Complex, Large-Scale Boolean Problems","volume":"18","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14485699","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595603/","dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Marsden Fund of New Zealand Government","grantNumber":"VUW0806"},{"fundingName":"University Research Fund, Victoria University of Wellington","grantNumber":"108738/3046"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reusing Building Blocks of Extracted Knowledge to Solve Complex, Large-Scale Boolean Problems","sourcePdf":"tevc-iqbal-2281537-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100337S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6866949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6866949","articleId":"6595603","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6595608,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Richter","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Richter","id":"37397695200"},{"name":"Rahman Nouroozi","affiliation":["Universitat Paderborn, Paderborn, Nordrhein-Westfalen, DE"],"firstName":"Rahman","lastName":"Nouroozi","id":"37319405800"},{"name":"Hubertus Suche","affiliation":["University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Hubertus","lastName":"Suche","id":"37281701000"},{"name":"Wolfgang Sohler","affiliation":["University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Sohler","id":"37270977400"},{"name":"Colja Schubert","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Colja","lastName":"Schubert","id":"37265973400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6595608","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical wavelength conversion","Bandwidth","Optical transmitters","Optical fibers","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","lithium compounds","optical frequency conversion","optical tuning","optical waveguides","optical wavelength conversion","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PPLN-waveguide","optical wavelength conversion tuning","QAM data","C-Band","quadrature amplitude modulated signal","cascaded sum frequency generation","difference frequency generation","periodically-poled lithium niobate module","bit-error ratio measurements","bit rate 40 Gbit/s","LiNbO3"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","difference-frequency generation","periodically-poled lithium niobate","sum-frequency generation","wavelength conversion"]}],"abstract":"Tunable optical wavelength conversion of a 40 Gb/s 16-ary quadrature amplitude modulated signal within the C-band is demonstrated by cascaded sum frequency generation and difference frequency generation in a periodically-poled lithium niobate module.

In theory, the idea of co-adapted subcomponents is desirable for solving large-scale optimization problems. However, in practice, without prior knowledge about the problem, it is not clear how the problem should be decomposed. In this paper, we propose an automatic decomposition strategy called differential grouping that can uncover the underlying interaction structure of the decision variables and form subcomponents such that the interdependence between them is kept to a minimum. We show mathematically how such a decomposition strategy can be derived from a definition of partial separability. The empirical studies show that such near-optimal decomposition can greatly improve the solution quality on large-scale global optimization problems. Finally, we show how such an automated decomposition allows for a better approximation of the contribution of various subcomponents, leading to a more efficient assignment of the computational budget to various subcomponents.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6821278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281543","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/6821278/06595612.pdf","startPage":"378","endPage":"393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Co-Evolution With Differential Grouping for Large Scale Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Co-Evolution With Differential Grouping for Large Scale Optimization","volume":"18","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","dateOfInsertion":"26 May 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595612/","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14332010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595612/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/J017515/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Co-Evolution With Differential Grouping for Large Scale Optimization","sourcePdf":"tevc-omidvar-2281543-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167085S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6821278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"338","xplore-issue":"6821278","articleId":"6595612","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6595613,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew J.

To evaluate the applicability of the proposed FMM-CART model, an evaluation with a benchmark data set pertaining to electrical motor bearing faults is first conducted. The results obtained are equivalent to those reported in the literature. Then, a laboratory experiment for detecting and diagnosing eccentricity faults in an induction motor is performed. In addition to producing accurate results, useful rules in the form of a decision tree are extracted to provide explanation and justification for the predictions from FMM-CART.

We establish a connection between the beneficial NLNS effect and the recently reported phase-conjugated twin wave (PCTW) concept and further generalize the PCTW concept to vector twin waves that are traveling through a fiber link along orthogonal dimensions such as time and space. Moreover, we apply the PCTW concept to wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) superchannel transmission by treating the entire WDM superchannel as a twin wave to further mitigate interchannel nonlinear effects.

Moreover, the experimental performance is also very competitive, compared with existing exact hypervolume algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2013.2281525","startPage":"481","endPage":"502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/6866949/06595628.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6866949","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quick Hypervolume","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Quick Hypervolume","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 July 2014","accessionNumber":"14485703","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6595628/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Funds through FCT-Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia","grantNumber":"PEst-OE/EEI/LA0021/2013, TAGS PTDC/EIA-EIA/112283/2009, NetDynPTDC/EIA-EIA/118533/2010, HELIX and PTDC/EEA-ELC/113999/2009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Quick Hypervolume","sourcePdf":"tevc-russo-2281525-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124341S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"6866949","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6866949","articleId":"6595628","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":6595639,"authors":[{"name":"Yunquan Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunquan","lastName":"Dong","id":"37714541300"},{"name":"Pingyi Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pingyi","lastName":"Fan","id":"37277801500"},{"name":"Khaled Ben Letaief","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, ClearWater Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Khaled Ben","lastName":"Letaief","id":"37273525100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6595639","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1138},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Rail transportation","Base stations","Fading","Channel capacity","Optimization","Communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","railway communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed railway wireless communications","high HSR communication mobility","cellular communications","power allocation","transmission rate","base station","time-varying data rate service","channel inversion allocation achieves","power efficiency","proportional fairness","temporal proportional-fair PA scheme","\u03b5-optimal allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel service","high-speed railway (HSR) communication","power allocation (PA)","proportional fairness (PF) along times"]}],"abstract":"High-speed railways (HSRs) have been widely deployed all over the world in recent years. Different from traditional cellular communications, the high mobility of HSR communication makes it essential to implement power allocation (PA) along time. In the HSR case, the transmission rate greatly depends on the distance between the base station (BS) and the train. As a result, the train receives a time-varying data rate service when passing by a BS. It is clear that the most efficient PA will spend all the power when the train is nearest the BS, which will cause great unfairness along time. On the other hand, channel inversion allocation achieves the best fairness in terms of constant rate transmission. However, its power efficiency is much lower. Therefore, power efficiency and fairness along time are two incompatible objects. For the HSR cellular system considered in this paper, a tradeoff between the two is achieved by proposing a temporal proportional-fair PA scheme. In addition, a near-optimal closed-form solution and one algorithm finding \u03b5-optimal allocation are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2281401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6739143/06595639.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2281401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6739143","startPage":"925","endPage":"930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Speed Railway Wireless Communications: Efficiency Versus Fairness","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Speed Railway Wireless Communications: Efficiency Versus Fairness","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595639/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14096859","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6595639/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed Railway Wireless Communications: Efficiency Versus Fairness","sourcePdf":"tvt-fan-2281401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073641S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6739143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6739143","articleId":"6595639","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6595643,"authors":[{"name":"Robert W.

The measurement results demonstrate that a system employing the dynamic timing control technique can operate in a wider frequency and voltage range.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595650/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","volume":"61","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"13998709","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6595650/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Timing Error Prevention Technique in Pipelines With Time Borrowing and Clock Stretching","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Timing Error Prevention Technique in Pipelines With Time Borrowing and Clock Stretching","sourcePdf":"tcsi-chae-2268272-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052693S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6704325","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6704325","articleId":"6595650","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6595652,"authors":[{"name":"Yunni Xia","affiliation":["School of Computers, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/7000614/6595652/6595652-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["YunNi Xia received the B.S. degree of computer science from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Peking University (PKU), Beijing, China, in 2008.","Since August 2008, he has been an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China.

In a cloud environment, service requests from users go through numerous provider-specific steps from the instant it is submitted to when the requested service is fully delivered. Quality modeling and analysis of clouds are not easy tasks because of the complexity of the automated provisioning mechanism and dynamically changing cloud environment. This work proposes an analytical model-based approach for quality evaluation of Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud by considering expected request completion time, rejection probability, and system overhead rate as key quality metrics. It also features with the modeling of different warm-up and cool-down strategies of machines and the ability to identify the optimal balance between system overhead and performance. To validate the correctness of the proposed model, we obtain simulative quality-of-service (QoS) data and conduct a confidence interval analysis. The result can be used to help design and optimize industrial cloud computing systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595652/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 September 2013","volume":"12","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"14836007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595652/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Modeling and Quality Evaluation of Infrastructure-as-a-Service Clouds","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Modeling and Quality Evaluation of Infrastructure-as-a-Service Clouds","sourcePdf":"tase-zhou-2276477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073465S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"7000614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"7000614","articleId":"6595652","onlineDate":"11 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6595729,"authors":[{"name":"David A.

In this paper, we propose the use of chirp modulation technique in a MIMO system, as the modulated signals have inherent interference rejection capability and immunity against Doppler shift and fading due to multipath propagation. The performance of chirp-based MIMO system is examined using Monte Carlo simulations over Rayleigh fading channel. For example, it is shown that a simple 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO system can offer a significant gain in performance relative to maximal ratio combining (MRC) using chirp modulation. Next, a multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) system is proposed, where each user is assigned a unique orthogonal chirp signal that efficiently modulates each user's incoming data as well as identifies them at the receiver. Numerical results show that chirp modulation is very effective in MU-MIMO system in eliminating the effects of multiple-access interference (MAI).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of multiuser MIMO communication system using chirp modulation","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588700/6595732/06595750.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance of multiuser MIMO communication system using chirp modulation","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595750/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13752165","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of multiuser MIMO communication system using chirp modulation","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"31SPECTS13paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079449S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588700","isNumber":"6595732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588700","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6595732","articleId":"6595750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Society for Modeling & Simulation International","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6595752,"authors":[{"name":"Sattar Hussain","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Sattar","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37402335400"},{"name":"Xavier Fernando","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Fernando","id":"37273307500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-56555-351-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-56555-352-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6595752","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595752","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Cognitive radio","Relays","Accuracy","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","bandwidth allocation","cognitive radio","diversity reception","Nakagami channels","probability","relay networks (telecommunication)","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay-based cognitive radio network","diversity channel","nonidentical fading channel","Nakagami-m fading channel","detect-amplify-and-forward strategy","DAF strategy","bandwidth requirement","statistical approach","detection probability","false alarm probability"]}],"publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (SPECTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588700/6595732/06595752.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel strategy for cognitive radio networks with diversity and non-identical fading channels","abstract":"This paper presents a novel approach for a relay-based cognitive radio (CR) networks with diversity and nonidentical Nakagami-m fading channels.

We also introduce a statistical approach to derive new closed-form expressions for average detection probability and average false alarm probability. The study clearly reveals that DAF strategy outperforms AF strategy in all suggested scenarios. The study shows that with DAF strategy, refraining the heavily faded relays improves the detection accuracy while reducing the bandwidth requirement of the relaying links.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595752/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13752167","publicationDate":"July 2013","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595752/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel strategy for cognitive radio networks with diversity and non-identical fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel strategy for cognitive radio networks with diversity and non-identical fading channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"34SPECTS13paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078499S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588700","isNumber":"6595732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588700","xplore-issue":"6595732","articleId":"6595752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Society for Modeling & Simulation International","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6595765,"authors":[{"name":"Chaoli Sun","affiliation":["Complex System and Computational Intelligence Laboratory, Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Chaoli","lastName":"Sun","id":"37404727100"},{"name":"Jianchao Zeng","affiliation":["Complex System and Computational Intelligence Laboratory, Taiyuan University of Science and Technology, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Jianchao","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37274478800"},{"name":"Jengshyang Pan","affiliation":["Shenzhen Graduate School, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Jengshyang","lastName":"Pan","id":"37277290900"},{"name":"Yaochu Jin","affiliation":["Department of Computing, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK"],"firstName":"Yaochu","lastName":"Jin","id":"37276322600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5849-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6595765","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Particle swarm optimization","Optimization","Linear programming","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","evolutionary computation","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","surrogate-assisted evolutionary","meta-heuristic optimization algorithms","fitness evaluations","similarity-based evolution control method","fitness estimation strategy","FESPSO","computationally expensive fitness function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595765","abstract":"Evolution control in the surrogate-assisted evolutionary and other meta-heuristic optimization algorithms is essential for their success in efficiently achieving the global optimum.

The training of the individual neural networks is controlled and a variance range is used to determine if the surrogates have been adequately trained to predict diverse and accurate solutions. Heterogeneous ensemble members are used due to the limited data available and results show that for certain parameters, predictions can be made to within 5% of the converged data's final output, using approximately 40% of the iterations needed for convergence. The implications of the method and results presented are that it is possible to use ensembles of Recurrent Neural Networks to provide accurate fitness predictions for an evolutionary algorithm and that they could be used to reduce the time needed to achieve optimal designs based on time-consuming Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations.","doi":"10.1109/CIDUE.2013.6595766","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Dynamic and Uncertain Environments (CIDUE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588695/6595763/06595766.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Dynamic and Uncertain Environments (CIDUE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIDUE.2013.6595766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent neural network ensembles for convergence prediction in surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Computational fluid dynamics","Data models","Predictive models","Accuracy","Recurrent neural networks","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational fluid dynamics","evolutionary computation","flow simulation","learning (artificial intelligence)","prediction theory","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network ensembles","convergence prediction","surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization","evolutionary algorithms","robust surrogate","computational fluid dynamics data","neural networks training","heterogeneous ensemble members","fitness predictions","optimal designs","computational fluid dynamics simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent neural network ensembles for convergence prediction in surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595766/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 2013","accessionNumber":"13752134","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent neural network ensembles for convergence prediction in surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RP02SS0495.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07092S","chronDate":"16-19 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588695","isNumber":"6595763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588695","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6595763","articleId":"6595766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6595767,"authors":[{"name":"Mard\u00e9 Helbig","affiliation":["CSIR: Meraka Institute Brummeria, South Africa; and University of Pretoria, Computer Science Pretoria, South Africa"],"firstName":"Mard\u00e9","lastName":"Helbig","id":"38243255500"},{"name":"Andries P.

The evaluation uncertainties and burden, however, greatly restrict the applications of IGA in complicated situations. Surrogate model approximating to the evaluation of the user has been generally applied to alleviate the evaluation burden of the user. The evaluation uncertainties, however, are not taken into account in existing research, therefore, a weighted multi-output gaussian process is here proposed to build the surrogate model by incorporating the uncertainty so as to enhance the performance of IGA. First, an IGA with interval fitness evaluation is adopted to depict the evaluation uncertainty, and the evaluation noise is defined based on the assignment. With the evaluation noise, the weight of each training sample is calculated and used to train a gaussian process which has two outputs to approximate the upper and lower values of the interval fitness, respectively. The trained gaussian process is treated as a fitness function and used to estimate the fitness of individuals generated in the subsequent evolutions. The proposed algorithm is applied to a benchmark function and a real-world fashion design to experimentally demonstrate its strength in searching.","doi":"10.1109/CIDUE.2013.6595769","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588695/6595763/06595769.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"38","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Dynamic and Uncertain Environments (CIDUE)","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Dynamic and Uncertain Environments (CIDUE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIDUE.2013.6595769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595763","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surrogate enhanced interactive genetic algorithm with weighted Gaussian process","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Surrogate enhanced interactive genetic algorithm with weighted Gaussian process","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13752137","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6595769/","conferenceDate":"16-19 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surrogate enhanced interactive genetic algorithm with weighted Gaussian process","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"RP05SS1007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075346S","chronDate":"16-19 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588695","isNumber":"6595763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588695","xplore-issue":"6595763","articleId":"6595769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6595776,"authors":[{"name":"Mard\u00e9 Helbig","affiliation":["CSIR: Meraka Institute Brummeria, South Africa; and University of Pretoria, Computer Science Pretoria, South Africa"],"firstName":"Mard\u00e9","lastName":"Helbig","id":"38243255500"},{"name":"Andries P.

Since all the processes on image recognition performed on a smart-phone, the system does not need to send images to a server and runs on an ordinary smartphone in a real-time way. To recognize food items, a user draws bounding boxes by touching the screen first, and then the system starts food item recognition within the indicated bounding boxes. To recognize them more accurately, we segment each food item region by GrubCut, extract a color histogram and SURF-based bag-of-features, and finally classify it into one of the fifty food categories with linear SVM and fast 2 kernel. In addition, the system estimates the direction of food regions where the higher SVM output score is expected to be obtained, show it as an arrow on the screen in order to ask a user to move a smartphone camera. This recognition process is performed repeatedly about once a second. We implemented this system as an Android smartphone application so as to use multiple CPU cores effectively for real-time recognition. In the experiments, we have achieved the 81.55% classification rate for the top 5 category candidates when the ground-truth bounding boxes are given. In addition, we obtained positive evaluation by user study compared to the food recording system without object recognition.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6595336/6595838/06595843.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2013.5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2013.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595838","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Mobile Food Recognition System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Image color analysis","Image recognition","Histograms","Kernel","Feature extraction","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","feature extraction","mobile computing","object recognition","operating systems (computers)","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile food recognition system","food calorie","food nutrition","image recognition","smart phone","food item recognition","GrubCut","color histogram extraction","SURF-based bag-of-feature","speeded up robust feature","linear SVM","support vector machines","Android smartphone application","ground-truth bounding box","object recognition","user eating habit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["food recognition","mobile image recognition","Android application"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595843/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Mobile Food Recognition System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595843/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13752182","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Mobile Food Recognition System","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"4990a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042907S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6595336","isNumber":"6595838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6595336","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6595838","articleId":"6595843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6595856,"authors":[{"name":"Xingjie Wei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Xingjie","lastName":"Wei","id":"37070257800"},{"name":"Chang-Tsun Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Chang-Tsun","lastName":"Li","id":"37278180500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4990-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"6595856","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Databases","Training","Probes","Time complexity","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphics","face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fixation based face recognition","saccade based face recognition","occlusions","expressions","biometric traits","fingerprint","iris","biological nature","human visual perception","FRGC","AR databases"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face recognition","occlusion","expression","biometrics","human visual perception","fixation","saccade","face"]}],"abstract":"Face recognition technique is widely used in the real-world applications over the past decade. Different from other biometric traits such as fingerprint and iris, face is the biological nature for humans to recognise a person even met just once. In this paper, we propose a novel method, which simulates the mechanism of fixations and saccades in human visual perception, to handle the face recognition from single image per person problem. Our method is robust to the local deformations of the face (i.e., expression changes and occlusions). Especially for the occlusion related problems, which have not received enough attentions compared with other challenging variations of illumination, expression and pose, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches despite various types of occlusions. Experimental results on the FRGC and the AR databases confirm the effectiveness of our method.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2013.18","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6595336/6595838/06595856.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2013.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595838","startPage":"70","endPage":"75","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fixation and Saccade Based Face Recognition from Single Image per Person with Various Occlusions and Expressions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595856","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fixation and Saccade Based Face Recognition from Single Image per Person with Various Occlusions and Expressions","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595856/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13752183","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6595856/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixation and Saccade Based Face Recognition from Single Image per Person with Various Occlusions and Expressions","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"4990a070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084969S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6595336","isNumber":"6595838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6595336","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6595838","articleId":"6595856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6595861,"authors":[{"name":"Samarth Bharadwaj","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Samarth","lastName":"Bharadwaj","id":"37531400300"},{"name":"Tejas I.

Several techniques have been proposed to counter face spoofing, however a robust solution that is computationally efficient is still unavailable. This paper presents a new approach for spoofing detection in face videos using motion magnification. Eulerian motion magnification approach is used to enhance the facial expressions commonly exhibited by subjects in a captured video. Next, two types of feature extraction algorithms are proposed: (i) a configuration of LBP that provides improved performance compared to other computationally expensive texture based approaches and (ii) motion estimation approach using HOOF descriptor. On the Print Attack and Replay Attack spoofing datasets, the proposed framework improves the state-of-art performance, especially HOOF descriptor yielding a near perfect half total error rate of 0%and 1.25% respectively.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2013.23","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6595336/6595838/06595861.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2013.23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595838","startPage":"105","endPage":"110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computationally Efficient Face Spoofing Detection with Motion Magnification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Computationally Efficient Face Spoofing Detection with Motion Magnification","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595861/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13767008","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6595861/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally Efficient Face Spoofing Detection with Motion Magnification","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"4990a105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065656S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6595336","isNumber":"6595838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6595336","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6595838","articleId":"6595861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6595863,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathon M.

However, the definition of a periocular region is subject to interpretation. This paper investigates the question of what is the best periocular region for recognition by identifying sub-regions of the ocular image when using near-infrared (NIR) or visible light (VL) sensors. To determine the best periocular region, we test two fundamentally different algorithms on challenging periocular datasets of contrasting build on four different periocular regions. Our results indicate that system performance does not necessarily improve as the ocular region becomes larger. Rather in NIR images the eye shape is more important than the brow or cheek as the image has little to no skin texture (leading to a smaller accepted region), while in VL images the brow is very important (requiring a larger region).","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2013.25","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6595336/6595838/06595863.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2013.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"What Is a \"Good\" Periocular Region for Recognition?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595863/","displayDocTitle":"What Is a \"Good\" Periocular Region for Recognition?","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13767034","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595863/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What Is a \"Good\" Periocular Region for Recognition?","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"4990a117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058685S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6595336","isNumber":"6595838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6595336","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6595838","articleId":"6595863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6595870,"authors":[{"name":"Jianjun Qian","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Qian","id":"37651446800"},{"name":"Jian Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280205100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4990-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"6595870","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Face recognition","Face","Databases","Testing","Robustness","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image classification","image coding","image reconstruction","image representation","iterative methods","regression analysis","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","regularized coding-based classification method","SRC","CRC","general regression and representation model","classification performance enhancement","GRR","leave-one-out strategy","k nearest neighbors","iterative algorithm","feature weights","test sample","reconstruction error","public face image databases"]}],"abstract":"Recently, the regularized coding-based classification method (e.g. SRC and CRC) shows a great potential for face recognition. However, most existing coding methods ignore the statistical information from the training data, which actually plays an important role in classification. To address this problem, we develop a general regression and representation model (GRR) for classification. GRR not only has advantages of CRC, but also introduces the prior information and the specific information to enhance the classification performance. In GRR, we combine the leave-one-out strategy with K Nearest Neighbors to learn the prior information from the training data. Meanwhile, the specific information is obtained by using the iterative algorithm to update the feature weights of the test sample. Finally, we classify the test sample based on the reconstruction error of each class. The proposed model is evaluated on public face image databases. And the experimental results demonstrate the advantages of GRR over state-of-the-art methods.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2013.32","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6595336/6595838/06595870.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2013.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General Regression and Representation Model for Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595870/","displayDocTitle":"General Regression and Representation Model for Face Recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13752205","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595870/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General Regression and Representation Model for Face Recognition","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"4990a166.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093693S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6595336","isNumber":"6595838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6595336","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6595838","articleId":"6595870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6595880,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun Soo Park","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Hyun Soo","lastName":"Park","id":"37086214937"},{"name":"Yu Wang","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37089065946"},{"name":"Eriko Nurvitadhi","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Eriko","lastName":"Nurvitadhi","id":"37393992500"},{"name":"James C.

Given a training image set that is representative of common views of a scene, our approach identifies a compact subset of the 3D point cloud for efficient localization, while achieving comparable localization performance to using the full 3D point cloud.

The descriptors proposed are easy to implement, produce relatively small-sized feature sets, and the multi-class classification scheme is fast and suitable for real-time applications. We intuitively characterize actions using pairwise affinities between view-invariant joint angles features over the performance of an action. Additionally, a new descriptor for spatio-temporal feature extraction from color and depth images is introduced.

A number of approaches have been proposed that extract representative features from 3D depth data, a reconstructed 3D surface mesh or more commonly from the recovered estimate of the human skeleton. Recent advances in neuroscience have discovered a neural encoding of static 3D shapes in primate infero-temporal cortex that can be represented as a hierarchy of medial axis and surface features. We hypothesize a similar neural encoding might also exist for 3D shapes in motion and propose a hierarchy of dynamic medial axis structures at several spatio-temporal scales that can be modeled using a set of Linear Dynamical Systems (LDSs). We then propose novel discriminative metrics for comparing these sets of LDSs for the task of human activity recognition. Combined with simple classification frameworks, our proposed features and corresponding hierarchical dynamical models provide the highest human activity recognition rates as compared to state-of-the-art methods on several skeletal datasets.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6595336/6595838/06595916.pdf","startPage":"471","endPage":"478","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2013.153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2013.153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595838","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired Dynamic 3D Discriminative Skeletal Features for Human Action Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Three-dimensional displays","Feature extraction","Measurement","Joints","Time series analysis","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gesture recognition","mesh generation","neural nets","pattern classification","shape recognition","solid modelling","surface fitting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired dynamic 3D discriminative skeletal features","human action recognition","Kinect","human gesture recognition","3D data","representative feature extraction","3D depth data","reconstructed 3D surface mesh","human skeleton","neuroscience","neural encoding","static 3D shapes","primate infero-temporal cortex","surface features","dynamic medial axis structures","spatio-temporal scales","linear dynamical systems","LDS","discriminative metrics","classification frameworks","hierarchical dynamical models","human activity recognition rates","state-of-the-art methods","skeletal datasets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired Dynamic 3D Discriminative Skeletal Features for Human Action Recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595916/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13767028","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired Dynamic 3D Discriminative Skeletal Features for Human Action Recognition","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"4990a471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068441S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6595336","isNumber":"6595838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6595336","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6595838","articleId":"6595916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6595917,"authors":[{"name":"Lorenzo Seidenari","affiliation":["University of Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Seidenari","id":"37393644800"},{"name":"Vincenzo Varano","affiliation":["University of Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Varano","id":"37073888800"},{"name":"Stefano Berretti","affiliation":["University of Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Berretti","id":"37269290400"},{"name":"Alberto Del Bimbo","affiliation":["University of Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Del Bimbo","id":"37326231100"},{"name":"Pietro Pala","affiliation":["University of Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Pietro","lastName":"Pala","id":"37271329700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4990-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"6595917","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":103,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":481},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joints","Three-dimensional displays","Torso","Cameras","Kinematics","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","gesture recognition","image representation","pattern classification","position measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["depth cameras","3D position estimation","skeletal joints","depth maps","human action recognition","body skeleton","kinematic chains","reference system","body translations","multi-part bag-of-poses approach","nearest-neighbor classification","Florence 3D Action dataset","MSR Daily Activity dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["action recognition","RGB-D","depth cameras"]}],"abstract":"Recently released depth cameras provide effective estimation of 3D positions of skeletal joints in temporal sequences of depth maps.

We are able to process 64 high resolution images (1920 \u00d7 1080 pixels) per second at 18 scales with a latency of less than 150 u s. 1.79 million HOG descriptors and their SVM classifications can be calculated per second and per scale, which outperforms current FPGA implementations by a factor of 4.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2013.95","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6595336/6595838/06595939.pdf","startPage":"629","endPage":"635","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2013.95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595838","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Based Real-Time Pedestrian Detection on High-Resolution Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595939/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Real-Time Pedestrian Detection on High-Resolution Images","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595939/","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13752233","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Real-Time Pedestrian Detection on High-Resolution Images","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"4990a629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049157S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6595336","isNumber":"6595838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6595336","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6595838","articleId":"6595939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6595958,"authors":[{"name":"Radu Dondera","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Dondera","id":"37945769500"},{"name":"Vlad Morariu","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Vlad","lastName":"Morariu","id":"38565091500"},{"name":"Larry Davis","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Larry","lastName":"Davis","id":"37271076500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4990-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"6595958","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"abstract":"We propose a learning-based method for detecting carried objects that generates candidate image regions from protrusion, color contrast and occlusion boundary cues, and uses a classifier to filter out the regions unlikely to be carried objects.

It scans a video with windows of variable shape and size. The abnormality of each window is measured by a likelihood ratio test statistic, which compares two hypotheses about whether or not the characteristics of the observations inside and outside the window are different. A semiparametric density ratio method is used to model the observations, which is applicable to a wide variety of data. To reduce the search complexity of the sliding window based scanning, a fast two-round scanning algorithm is proposed.

For each subject enrolled in the gallery, we acquire a high-resolution 3D model from which we generate a series of rendered face images of varying viewpoint. The result of regularly sampling face pose for all subjects is a redundant basis that over represents each target. To recognize an unknown probe image, we perform a sparse reconstruction of SIFT features extracted from the probe using a basis of SIFT features from the gallery. While directly collecting images over varying pose for all enrolled subjects is prohibitive at enrollment, the use of high speed, 3D acquisition systems allows our face recognition system to quickly acquire a single model, and generate synthetic views offline. Finally we show, using two publicly available datasets, how our approach performs when using rendered gallery images to recognize 2D rendered probe images and 2D probe images acquired using PTZ cameras.","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2013.116","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6595336/6595838/06595960.pdf","startPage":"775","endPage":"780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2013.116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using 3D Models to Recognize 2D Faces in the Wild","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595960/","displayDocTitle":"Using 3D Models to Recognize 2D Faces in the Wild","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13752219","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595960/","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using 3D Models to Recognize 2D Faces in the Wild","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"4990a775.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062842S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6595336","isNumber":"6595838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6595336","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6595838","articleId":"6595960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6595972,"authors":[{"name":"F.

For the first aspect, the proposed schemes were heuristically driven. For the second aspect, the difficulty resides in finding an accurate mapping that transfers unseen data samples into an existing manifold. Past works addressing these two aspects were heavily parametric in the sense that the optimal performance is only reached for a suitable parameter choice that should be known in advance. In this paper, we demonstrate that sparse coding theory not only serves for automatic graph reconstruction as shown in recent works, but also represents an accurate alternative for out-of-sample embedding. Considering for a case study the Laplacian Eigenmaps, we applied our method to the face recognition problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed out-of-sample embedding, experiments are conducted using the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Kernel Support Vector Machines (KSVM) classifiers on four public face databases. The experimental results show that the proposed model is able to achieve high categorization effectiveness as well as high consistency with non-linear embeddings/manifolds obtained in batch modes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2013.127","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6595336/6595838/06595972.pdf","startPage":"862","endPage":"868","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2013.127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Out-of-Sample Embedding for Manifold Learning Applied to Face Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Out-of-Sample Embedding for Manifold Learning Applied to Face Recognition","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6595972/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13767027","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595972/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Out-of-Sample Embedding for Manifold Learning Applied to Face Recognition","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"4990a862.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060884S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6595336","isNumber":"6595838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6595336","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6595838","articleId":"6595972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6595977,"authors":[{"name":"Christos Sagonas","affiliation":["Computer Department, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Sagonas","id":"38235030100"},{"name":"Georgios Tzimiropoulos","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, London, GB"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Tzimiropoulos","id":"37396761900"},{"name":"Stefanos Zafeiriou","affiliation":["Computer Department, Imperial College London, UK"],"firstName":"Stefanos","lastName":"Zafeiriou","id":"37299691200"},{"name":"Maja Pantic","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, London, GB"],"firstName":"Maja","lastName":"Pantic","id":"37273162000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4990-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-7516"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-7508"}],"articleNumber":"6595977","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":212,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":562},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases","Face","Shape","Deformable models","Training","Lighting","Face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image retrieval","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["facial landmark annotation","deformable face model development","massive annotated facial databases","cross-database experiments","semiautomatic annotation methodology","MultiPIE database","XM2VTS database","AR database","FRGC Ver. 2 database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face analysis Facial point detection"]}],"abstract":"Developing powerful deformable face models requires massive, annotated face databases on which techniques can be trained, validated and tested. Manual annotation of each facial image in terms of landmarks requires a trained expert and the workload is usually enormous. Fatigue is one of the reasons that in some cases annotations are inaccurate. This is why, the majority of existing facial databases provide annotations for a relatively small subset of the training images. Furthermore, there is hardly any correspondence between the annotated land-marks across different databases. These problems make cross-database experiments almost infeasible. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a semi-automatic annotation methodology for annotating massive face datasets. This is the first attempt to create a tool suitable for annotating massive facial databases. We employed our tool for creating annotations for MultiPIE, XM2VTS, AR, and FRGC Ver. 2 databases. The annotations will be made publicly available from http://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/ resources/facial-point-annotations/. Finally, we present experiments which verify the accuracy of produced annotations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Semi-automatic Methodology for Facial Landmark Annotation","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","doi":"10.1109/CVPRW.2013.132","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6595336/6595838/06595977.pdf","startPage":"896","endPage":"903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPRW.2013.132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595838","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6595977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6595977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-28 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Semi-automatic Methodology for Facial Landmark Annotation","conferenceDate":"23-28 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6595977/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13752213","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Semi-automatic Methodology for Facial Landmark Annotation","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"4990a896.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059368S","chronDate":"23-28 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6595336","isNumber":"6595838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6595336","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"6595838","articleId":"6595977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6596051,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Neisse","affiliation":["European Commission Joint Research Center, Institute for Protection and Security of Citizen, Ispra, Italy"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Neisse","id":"37266867700"},{"name":"Joerg Doerr","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Joerg","lastName":"Doerr","id":"37282588700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5839-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6596051","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Concrete","Supply chains","System analysis and design","Engines","Security","Operating systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","business data processing","formal specification","supply chains"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-based specification","usage control policies refinement","authorizations","obligations","policy specifications","high-level usage control policies","abstract system model","implementation-level policies","concrete system model","supply chain scenario","BPMN engine","business process model and notation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596051","doi":"10.1109/PST.2013.6596051","publicationTitle":"2013 Eleventh Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust","abstract":"In existing usage control policy frameworks, policies consisting of authorizations and obligations are specified at a low level of abstraction. As a consequence, these policy specifications become long and complex since they reference many technical elements of the system such as operating system calls or web-service invocations. Due to this complexity, it is difficult for policy authors to assess if the policies they specify are complete and correct in order to achieve their high-level usage control goals. In this paper we describe our approach for specification and refinement of usage control policies that addresses this complexity problem. In our approach, high-level usage control policies are specified considering an abstract system model and automatically refined with the help of policy refinement rules to implementation-level policies. The input of our refinement rules is the abstract system model, the concrete system model, the system refinement steps from abstract to concrete, and the abstract usage control policies. We show the application of our approach in a case study of a supply chain scenario implemented using BPMN. In our case study high-level usage control policies are automatically refined to implementation-level policies that can be enforced in a BPMN engine.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PST.2013.6596051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596025","startPage":"169","endPage":"176","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Eleventh Annual Conference on Privacy, Security and Trust","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589044/6596025/06596051.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-based specification and refinement of usage control policies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6596051/","displayDocTitle":"Model-based specification and refinement of usage control policies","conferenceDate":"10-12 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13767004","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-based specification and refinement of usage control policies","confLoc":"Tarragona, Spain","sourcePdf":"31152000S036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063105S","chronDate":"10-12 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589044","isNumber":"6596025","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589044","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6596025","articleId":"6596051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6596069,"authors":[{"name":"Puripong Suthisopapan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Khon Kaen University, Thailand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6672059/6596069/6596069-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Puripong Suthisopapan received the B.Eng degree in Electrical Engineering from Khon Kaen University, Thailand in 2007.

In order to attain near capacity region with reasonable complexity, low-complexity detector with soft-output generation is necessary for coded large MIMO systems. We show in this paper that the non-binary LDPC codes and well-known soft-output MMSE detector can be utilized to significantly reduce the gap to capacity. We also propose a novel soft-output MF-based detector for the non-binary LDPC coded large MIMO systems. With this proposed detector, capacity approaching performance, i.e., the gap to capacity of 1.6 dB, can be achieved with ultra low-complexity detection, e.g., just 0.28% of MMSE detection. Moreover, use of the proposed scheme in large MIMO systems is found to be robust to the presence of imperfect channel estimation and spatial fading correlation which are both the realistic scenarios for large MIMO systems.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.090513.122056","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6672059/06596069.pdf","startPage":"5185","endPage":"5199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.090513.122056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Achieving Near Capacity of Non-Binary LDPC Coded Large MIMO Systems with a Novel Ultra Low-Complexity Soft-Output Detector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","displayDocTitle":"Achieving Near Capacity of Non-Binary LDPC Coded Large MIMO Systems with a Novel Ultra Low-Complexity Soft-Output Detector","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596069/","publicationDate":"October 2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13918191","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6596069/","volume":"12","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Achieving Near Capacity of Non-Binary LDPC Coded Large MIMO Systems with a Novel Ultra Low-Complexity Soft-Output Detector","sourcePdf":"5185-tw1310-puri.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109818S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6672059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6672059","articleId":"6596069","onlineDate":"12 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6596070,"authors":[{"name":"Michal Cierny","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6672059/6596070/6596070-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michal \u010cierny received his Be.

To manage this interference 3GPP introduced almost blank subframe (ABSF), a subframe in which the interferer tier is not allowed to transmit data. Vulnerable users thus get a chance to be scheduled in ABSFs with reduced cross-tier interference. We analyze downlink scenarios using stochastic geometry and formulate a condition for the required number of ABSFs based on base station placement statistics and user throughput requirement. The result is a semi-analytical formula that serves as a good initial estimate and offers an easy way to analyze impact of network parameters. We show that while in macro/femto scenario the residue ABSF interference can be well managed, in macro/pico scenario it affects the number of required ABSFs strongly. The effect of ABSFs is subsequently demonstrated via user throughput simulations. Especially in the macro/pico scenario, we find that using ABSFs is advantageous for the system since victim users no longer suffer from poor performance for the price of relatively small drop in higher throughput percentiles.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Macrocell networks","Femtocells","Downlink","Throughput","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cochannel interference","femtocellular radio","interference suppression","microcellular radio","picocellular radio","statistical analysis","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous cellular network","macrocell","femtocell","cochannel cross-tier interference reduction","3GPP","almost blank subframe","stochastic geometry","base station placement statistics","user throughput requirement","network parameter estimation","residue ABSF interference","picocells"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Almost blank subframe","interference management","heterogeneous network","HetNet"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596070","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.090513.121756","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6672059/06596070.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.090513.121756","startPage":"5061","endPage":"5073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Number of Almost Blank Subframes in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Number of Almost Blank Subframes in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596070/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","volume":"12","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6596070/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13918193","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Number of Almost Blank Subframes in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"5061-tw1310-michal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094796S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6672059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6672059","articleId":"6596070","onlineDate":"12 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6596071,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Zhong","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, P.

In this work, we consider the joint estimation of an unknown node's location and clock parameters by incorporating the effect of imperfections in node oscillators, which render a time varying nature to the clock parameters. The data exchange mechanism is based on a two-way message exchange with anchor nodes. In order to alleviate the computational complexity associated with the optimal maximum a-posteriori estimator, two iterative approaches are proposed as simpler alternatives. The first approach utilizes an Expectation-Maximization (EM) based algorithm which iteratively estimates the clock parameters and the location of the unknown node. The EM algorithm is further simplified by a non-linear processing of the data to obtain a closed form solution of the location estimation problem using least squares (LS). The performance of the estimation algorithms is benchmarked by deriving the Hybrid Cramer-Rao lower bound (HCRB) on the mean square error (MSE) of the estimators. The theoretical findings are corroborated by simulation studies which reveal that the LS estimator closely matches the performance of the EM algorithm for small time of arrival measurement noise, and is well suited for implementation in low cost sensor networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Node Localization and Time-Varying Clock Synchronization in Wireless Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.090413.130324","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6672059/06596074.pdf","startPage":"5322","endPage":"5333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.090413.130324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596074/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","displayDocTitle":"Joint Node Localization and Time-Varying Clock Synchronization in Wireless Sensor Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6596074/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13918177","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Node Localization and Time-Varying Clock Synchronization in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"5322-tw1310-ahmad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14674S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6672059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6672059","articleId":"6596074","onlineDate":"12 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6596076,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Han Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6672059/6596076/6596076-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Han Yang (S'06) received his B.S. in electrical engineering in 2004, and two M.S. degrees in computer science and communication engineering in 2007, from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.

A key problem in wireless access network selection is to study the rational strategy considering the negative network externality, i.e, the influence of subsequent users' decisions on an individual's throughput due to the limited available resources. In this work, we formulate the wireless network selection problem as a stochastic game with negative network externality and show that finding the optimal decision rule can be modelled as a multi-dimensional Markov Decision Process (MDP). A modified value iteration algorithm is proposed to efficiently obtain the optimal decision rule with a simple threshold structure, which enables us to reduce the storage space of the strategy profile. We further investigate the mechanism design problem with incentive compatibility constraints, which enforce the networks to reveal the truthful state information. The formulated problem is a mixed integer programming problem which in general lacks an efficient solution. Exploiting the optimality of substructures, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm that can optimally solve the problem in the two-network scenario. For the multi-network scenario, the proposed algorithm can outperform the heuristic greedy approach in a polynomial-time complexity. Finally, simulation results are shown to validate the analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms..","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.090513.122033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6672059/06596076.pdf","startPage":"5048","endPage":"5060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.090513.122033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Access Network Selection Game with Negative Network Externality","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596076","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596076/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Access Network Selection Game with Negative Network Externality","volume":"12","issue":"10","publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13918207","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6596076/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Access Network Selection Game with Negative Network Externality","sourcePdf":"5048-tw1310-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138786S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6672059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6672059","articleId":"6596076","onlineDate":"12 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6596077,"authors":[{"name":"Lakshmi Prasad Natarajan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6672059/6596077/6596077-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lakshmi Prasad Natarajan was born in Tamil Nadu, India.

A number of FFSs are available in the literature that provably attain full-diversity. However, there is no known full-diversity criterion that universally applies to all FFSs. In this paper a universal necessary condition for any FFS to achieve full-diversity is given, and based on this criterion the notion of Feedback-Transmission duration optimal (FT-optimal) FFSs is introduced, which are schemes that use minimum amount of feedback N for the given transmission duration T, and minimum T for the given N to achieve full-diversity. When there is no feedback (N = 1) an FT-optimal scheme consists of a single STBC, and the proposed condition reduces to the well known necessary and sufficient condition for an STBC to achieve fulldiversity. Also, a sufficient criterion for full-diversity is given for FFSs in which the component STBC yielding the largest minimum Euclidean distance is chosen, using which full-rate (N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n complex symbols per channel use) full-diversity FT-optimal schemes are constructed for all N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">t</sub>\n > 1.

To do so, the issue of imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter is considered when frequency-division duplexing is used, for which the feedback channel is limited. We first introduce a regret based learning approach to optimize the transmit beamforming parameters for the cases when the feedback channel is temporarily unavailable during deep fades. We then propose a coalition formation game model to cluster the small cell base stations so that they can perform cluster-wise joint beamforming. We take the \\tit{recursive core} as the solution concept of the coalition formation game. To obtain the recursive core, we first consider a typical merge-split algorithm. However, we show that this algorithm can be unstable.

Finally, we analyze the average number and the average size of coalitions that can form during such a coalition formation process.

This relationship has been used to get network coding maps satisfying the exclusive law. But, only the scenario in which the end nodes use M-PSK signal sets has been addressed previously. In this paper, we address the case in which the end nodes use M-QAM signal sets. In a fading scenario, for certain channel conditions \u03b3e\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j\u03b8</sup>\n, termed singular fade states, the end-to-end performance is greatly reduced. By formulating a procedure for finding the exact number of singular fade states for QAM, we show that square QAM signal sets give lesser number of singular fade states compared to PSK signal sets. This reduces the computational complexity at the relay node. It is shown that the criterion for partitioning the complex plane, for the purpose of using a particular network code for a particular fade state, is different from that used for M-PSK. Using a modified criterion, we describe a procedure to analytically partition the complex plane representing the channel condition. We show that when M-QAM (M >4) signal set is used, the conventional XOR network mapping fails to remove the ill effects of \u03b3e\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">j\u03b8</sup>\n=1, which is a singular fade state for all signal sets of arbitrary size. We show that a doubly block circulant Latin Square removes this singular fade state for M-QAM. Finally it is shown that M-QAM gives superior performance over M-PSK.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6672059/06596080.pdf","startPage":"5074","endPage":"5086","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.090413.122093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.090413.122093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Layer Network Coding for Two-Way Relaying with QAM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Relays","Network coding","Constellation diagram","Physical layer","Phase shift keying","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","network coding","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical layer network coding","two-way relaying","quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","network coding maps","M-PSK signal sets","singular fade states","computational complexity","relay node","doubly block circulant latin square"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Latin square","network coding","relay channel","two-way relaying","wireless network coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596080/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Physical Layer Network Coding for Two-Way Relaying with QAM","volume":"12","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6596080/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13918183","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Layer Network Coding for Two-Way Relaying with QAM","sourcePdf":"5074-tw1310-vishnu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096933S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6672059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6672059","articleId":"6596080","onlineDate":"12 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6596081,"authors":[{"name":"ChunSheng Xin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6672059/6596081/6596081-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["ChunSheng Xin is an Associate Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Old Dominion University.

Therefore, PUs are unwilling to cooperate with secondary users (SUs) and intend to set up stringent requirements on SUs' spectrum access. This diminishes the benefit of dynamic spectrum access and hinders its commercialization success. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for dynamic spectrum access networks, termed incentivized cooperative dynamic spectrum access network (IC-DSAN), to motivate PUs to cooperate with SUs, such that both PUs and SUs achieve significantly higher performance. In an IC-DSAN, SU nodes serve as relays between PU nodes and while relaying PU packets, utilize network coding to encode SU packets onto PU packets, i.e., SU packets get a `free ride' via network coding. To further improve the performance, we propose a new network coding scheme termed coding over coded packets. At last, an optimization model is developed to analyze the throughput gain of IC-DSAN. The performance evaluation indicates that the throughputs of both PUs and SUs significantly increase.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.090413.122052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672059","startPage":"5154","endPage":"5161","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6672059/06596081.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Incentivized Cooperative Architecture for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6596081/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Incentivized Cooperative Architecture for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13918185","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Incentivized Cooperative Architecture for Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks","sourcePdf":"5154-tw1310-xin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084537S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6672059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6672059","articleId":"6596081","onlineDate":"12 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596082,"authors":[{"name":"Harpreet S.

In particular, we consider and compare space division multiple access (SDMA), single user beamforming (SU-BF), and baseline single-input single-output (SISO) transmission. For this general model, the main contributions are: (i) ordering results for both coverage probability and per user rate in closed form for any BS distribution for the three considered techniques, using novel tools from stochastic orders, (ii) upper bounds on the coverage probability assuming a Poisson BS distribution, and (iii) a comparison of the area spectral efficiency (ASE). The analysis concretely demonstrates, for example, that for a given total number of transmit antennas in the network, it is preferable to spread them across many single-antenna BSs vs. fewer multi-antenna BSs. Another observation is that SU-BF provides higher coverage and per user data rate than SDMA, but SDMA is in some cases better in terms of ASE.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.090513.130142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.090513.130142","startPage":"5208","endPage":"5222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6672059/06596082.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink MIMO HetNets: Modeling, Ordering Results and Performance Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Downlink MIMO HetNets: Modeling, Ordering Results and Performance Analysis","volume":"12","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13918192","publicationDate":"October 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6596082/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink MIMO HetNets: Modeling, Ordering Results and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"5208-tw1310-dhillon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158255S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6672059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"197","xplore-issue":"6672059","articleId":"6596082","onlineDate":"12 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6596083,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Sakzad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6672059/6596083/6596083-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amin Sakzad (M'12) was born in Iran where he received the B.Sc., M.Sc. and Ph.D. degree from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2005, 2007, and 2011 respectively, all in pure and applied Mathematics.

We further assume that the destination chooses N relays with power gains exceeding a threshold to do transmit beamforming and feeds back B bits to specify a precoding vector from a randomly generated precoder codebook. For the given average feedback bits per relay, B\u0305 = B/M, we find the optimal threshold that maximizes the capacity of a decode-and-forward (DF) system when the number of relays is asymptotically large. We show that the system using this asymptotically optimal threshold has a larger capacity than a system using all relays for finite B\u0305, especially for small values of B\u0305. We also obtain numerically the optimal thresholds for systems with a finite number of relays. A simplified approach that uses a fixed number of relays is also proposed and leads to significant improvements. Given a fixed power budget, the power allocation between two phases is also examined in networks with asymptotically large numbers of relays, and the optimal power allocation fraction can be found numerically.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596084/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","volume":"12","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"13918198","publicationDate":"October 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6596084/","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Relay Subset Selection in Cooperative Systems with Beamforming and Limited Feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay Subset Selection in Cooperative Systems with Beamforming and Limited Feedback","sourcePdf":"5271-tw1310-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080249S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6672059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6672059","articleId":"6596084","onlineDate":"12 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6596091,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, P.R.

The embedding of source compression into modulation brings significant throughput gain when the physical layer data contain non-negligible redundancy. The kernel of CCM is a new random projection (RP) code inspired by the compressive sensing (CS) theory. The RP code generates multilevel symbols from source binaries through weighted sum operations. Then, the generated RP symbols are mapped into a dense constellation for transmission. The receiver performs joint decoding based on received symbols. As the number of RP symbols can be adjusted in fine granularity, the rate adaptation becomes seamless. Two key design issues in the proposed CCM are addressed in this paper. First, we consider the RP code design for sources with different redundancies. Three principles are established and a concrete implementation is given. Second, we devise a linear-time decoding algorithm for the proposed RP code. In this belief propagation (BP) algorithm, we find that computing convolution in time domain is more efficient than that in frequency domain for binary variable nodes. Moreover, we invent a ZigZag deconvolution to further reduce the complexity. Analysis show that the proposed decoding algorithm is nearly 20 times faster than the state-of-the-art BP algorithm for CS called CS-BP. Emulations on traced data show that CCM achieves significant throughput gain, up to 33% and 70%, respectively, over the Hybrid ARQ with compression and BICM with compression, under practical time-varying wireless channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6672059/06596091.pdf","startPage":"4892","endPage":"4904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.090413.121308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.090413.121308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672059","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596091","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Coded Modulation for Seamless Rate Adaptation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Decoding","Wireless communication","Channel coding","Wireless sensor networks","Redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","binary codes","combined source-channel coding","compressed sensing","decoding","deconvolution","interleaved codes","modulation coding","random codes","time-varying channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive coded modulation","seamless rate adaptation","joint source-channel coding","source compression","physical layer data","nonnegligible redundancy","random projection code","compressive sensing","multilevel symbols","joint decoding","linear-time decoding algorithm","belief propagation algorithm","binary variable nodes","ZigZag deconvolution","throughput gain","hybrid ARQ","BICM","time-varying wireless channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modulation","JSCC","rate adaptation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"October  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Coded Modulation for Seamless Rate Adaptation","volume":"12","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6596091/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"October 2013","accessionNumber":"13918189","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Coded Modulation for Seamless Rate Adaptation","sourcePdf":"4892-tw1310-cui.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137115S","chronDate":"October  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6672059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6672059","articleId":"6596091","onlineDate":"12 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596130,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zhou","affiliation":["SCI Institute and the School of Computing, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37073908100"},{"name":"Charles Hansen","affiliation":["SCI Institute and the School of Computing, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Hansen","id":"37266777200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4797-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-8765"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-8773"}],"articleNumber":"6596130","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Feature extraction","Histograms","Joints","Transfer functions","Rendering (computer graphics)","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","feature extraction","Gaussian processes","interactive systems","query processing","rendering (computer graphics)","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transfer function design","user selected samples","intuitive multivariate volume exploration","multivariate volumetric datasets","TF design approach","multivariate volumetric data visualization","spatial domain","high dimensional transfer functions","HDTF","kernel density estimation","KDE","2D Gaussian TF","dimensionality reduced space","feature extraction","volume rendering view","segmentation brushes","seismic data sets"]},{"kwd":["Computer Graphics [I.3.7]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism\u2014Color, shading, shadowing and texture","Image Processing and Computer Vision [I.4.10]: Image Representation\u2014Volumetric"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596130","abstract":"Multivariate volumetric datasets are important to both science and medicine. We propose a transfer function (TF) design approach based on user selected samples in the spatial domain to make multivariate volumetric data visualization more accessible for domain users. Specifically, the user starts the visualization by probing features of interest on slices and the data values are instantly queried by user selection. The queried sample values are then used to automatically and robustly generate high dimensional transfer functions (HDTFs) via kernel density estimation (KDE). Alternatively, 2D Gaussian TFs can be automatically generated in the dimensionality reduced space using these samples. With the extracted features rendered in the volume rendering view, the user can further refine these features using segmentation brushes. Interactivity is achieved in our system and different views are tightly linked. Use cases show that our system has been successfully applied for simulation and complicated seismic data sets.","doi":"10.1109/PacificVis.2013.6596130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis.2013.6596130","startPage":"73","endPage":"80","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588673/6596110/06596130.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transfer function design based on user selected samples for intuitive multivariate volume exploration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 27 2013-March 1 2013","displayDocTitle":"Transfer function design based on user selected samples for intuitive multivariate volume exploration","conferenceDate":"27 Feb.-1 March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6596130/","accessionNumber":"13766812","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596130/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transfer function design based on user selected samples for intuitive multivariate volume exploration","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"073080zhou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079468S","chronDate":"Feb. 27 2013-March 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588673","isNumber":"6596110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588673","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6596110","articleId":"6596130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":6596237,"authors":[{"name":"Ervin Kamenar","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Centre for Micro and Nano Sciences and Technologies, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia"],"firstName":"Ervin","lastName":"Kamenar","id":"37074203000"},{"name":"Sa\u0161a Zelenika","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Centre for Micro and Nano Sciences and Technologies, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia"],"firstName":"Sa\u0161a","lastName":"Zelenika","id":"38193232900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-233-073-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-953-233-076-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6596237","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"abstract":"In this paper a micropositioning mechatronics system is conceived and described. Its mechanical design is optimized in order to achieve high precision displacements. High speed closed-loop feedback control is obtained by using both PID and ramp control algorithms programmed as virtual instruments (VI) on an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) module. User controls are programmed in an independent Host VI. A Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) is employed as a position feedback sensor, while positioning accuracy and repeatability are experimentally assessed by using a Michelson-type laser Doppler interferometric system. Different experiments with point-to-point positioning are conducted. In the first set of experiments, positioning with 100 \u03bcm steps is performed. In a second step, 10 mm positioning experiments are done. The system shows a marked nonlinearity when longer positioning steps are used; this nonlinearity influences significantly the output error. It is hence found that the main contribution to system's nonlinearity is caused by the LVDT. The error is compensated via system linearization by an experimentally obtained analytical function which is programmed in the LabVIEW Host VI. Positioning accuracy and repeatability are finally assessed experimentally again and true micrometric positioning is achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 36th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588635/6596208/06596237.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"130","publicationTitle":"2013 36th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596208","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Micropositioning mechatronics system based on FPGA architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Mechatronics","Accuracy","Actuators","PD control","Optical interferometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","differential transformers","displacement control","feedback","field programmable gate arrays","mechatronics","Michelson interferometers","micropositioning","precision engineering","sensors","three-term control","virtual instrumentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["micropositioning mechatronics system","FPGA architecture","mechanical design","high precision displacements","high speed closed-loop feedback control","PID control algorithms","ramp control algorithms","virtual instruments","field programmable gate array module","FPGA module","linear variable differential transformer","LVDT","position feedback sensor","Michelson-type laser Doppler interferometric system","point-to-point positioning","positioning experiments","output error","system nonlinearity","analytical function","LabVIEW Host VI","positioning accuracy","positioning repeatability","micrometric positioning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Micropositioning mechatronics system based on FPGA architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6596237/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13768130","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Micropositioning mechatronics system based on FPGA architecture","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"01250130.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124453S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588635","isNumber":"6596208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588635","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6596208","articleId":"6596237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MIPRO","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596306,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad M.

Depletion of this energy depends on not only the long-distance communications between the sensors and sink node, but also the active state period length. Power consumption of each sensor is the most important factor that affects the network lifetime severely. In other words, decreasing the long-distance exchanges between sensors and sink node leads to prolong the network lifetime and increase the network performance. Clustering method is considered one of the best well-known approaches that efficiently helps in increasing the overall network lifetime. In this paper, we incorporate genetic algorithm (GA) with hierarchical clustering for the sake of reducing the long-distance communications.

The cognitive radio has been proposed to meet the ever increasing demand of the radio spectrum by allocating the spectrum dynamically to allow unlicensed access on non-interfering basis. But, the conventional spectrum sensing methods are seeking for spectrum opportunities in either of three dimensions viz. time, frequency and space. However, other dimensions like `Code' and `Angle' need to be explored further for spectrum opportunity. This paper investigates the performance of Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation algorithms like MUSIC, Capon and ESPRIT in cognitive radio networks. The adaptive thresholding has been proposed to improve the performance of DOA algorithms. The results show that the performance of the algorithms improves with increasing number of array elements, increasing number of snapshots and increasing signal to-noise ratio. This new approach of DoA estimation of licensed user, increases channel capacity and improves frequency reuse capability by multiplexing licensed and unlicensed users into the same channel at the same time in the same geographical area by forming the beam of unlicensed user in the direction other than the licensed users' DoA direction.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 36th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588635/6596208/06596312.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596208","publicationTitle":"2013 36th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)","startPage":"507","endPage":"512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of DoA estimation algorithms in cognitive radio networks: -A new approach in spectrum sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of DoA estimation algorithms in cognitive radio networks: -A new approach in spectrum sensing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596312/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6596312/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13768273","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","conferenceDate":"20-24 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of DoA estimation algorithms in cognitive radio networks: -A new approach in spectrum sensing","confLoc":"Opatija, Croatia","sourcePdf":"05070512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063339S","chronDate":"20-24 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588635","isNumber":"6596208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588635","xplore-issue":"6596208","articleId":"6596312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MIPRO","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6596492,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science in Beijing Jiaoto University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6948290/6596492/6596492-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Wang received the PhD and MS degrees in electronic engineering in 2010 and 2006 from Xi'an Jiaotong University, China.

The proposed method utilizes a two-dimensional convolution algorithm to interpolate bivariate functions from tabulated function values in the complex domain. To reduce the memory requirements for lookup tables, the interpolation is decomposed into independent row and column computations, such that the same coefficient table can be shared. Three different interpolation kernels from degree-1 (linear) to degree-2 (quadratic Lagrange) and degree-3 (cubic Lagrange) are explored to find the optimal design parameters and the most acceptable trade-offs between performance and hardware resources. Moreover, a generic hardware architecture is designed to provide scalable implementation capabilities for computation precision and interpolation degree. To verify the proposed architecture, eight complex reciprocal and eight complex exponential design instances are implemented. The ASIC- and FPGA-based experimental results show that the proposed scheme can efficiently approximate the complex reciprocal and exponential functions with up to 16-bit precision, as well as achieve a considerable reduction of memory requirements compared with traditional bipartite and multipartite schemes. The proposed method is also applicable to other complex functions.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2013.181","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/6948290/06596492.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6948290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2013.181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"2948","endPage":"2960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex Function Approximation Using Two-Dimensional Interpolation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Complex Function Approximation Using Two-Dimensional Interpolation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596492/","volume":"63","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6596492/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14710060","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex Function Approximation Using Two-Dimensional Interpolation","sourcePdf":"tc-wang-181-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125719S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6948290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6948290","articleId":"6596492","onlineDate":"12 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6596496,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Tan","affiliation":["IBM T.J.

The 4-way interleaved ADC consists of a pair of frontend variable gain amplifiers (VGAs) driving four sets of track-and-hold (T/H) switches, followed by fine VGAs that drive 6-bit comparator arrays.

Also integrated is an 8-bit calibration DAC that is used as a reference to nullify the accumulated offset of the entire signal path, as well as to compensate for the nominal nonlinearity of the fine VGA and the resistor ladder.

Accurate and reliable electricity market price forecasting is essential to facilitate various decision making activities of market participants in the future smart grid environment. However, due to the nonstationarities involved in market clearing prices (MCPs), it is rather difficult to accurately predict MCPs in advance. The challenge is getting intensified as more and more renewable energy and other new technologies emerged in smart grids. Therefore transformation from traditional point forecasts to probabilistic interval forecasts can be of great importance to quantify the uncertainties of potential forecasts, thus effectively supporting the decision making activities against uncertainties and risks ahead. This paper proposes a hybrid approach to construct prediction intervals of MCPs with a two-stage formulation. In the first stage, extreme learning machine (ELM) is applied to estimate point forecasts of MCPs and model uncertainties involved. In the second stage, the maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the noise variance. A generalized and comprehensive evaluation framework for probabilistic electricity price forecasting is proposed in this paper. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method has been validated through comprehensive tests using real price data from Australian electricity market.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2013.2274465","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6693741/06596510.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"470","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2013.2274465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6693741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Approach for Probabilistic Forecasting of Electricity Price","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Approach for Probabilistic Forecasting of Electricity Price","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","accessionNumber":"13998158","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6596510/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Approach for Probabilistic Forecasting of Electricity Price","sourcePdf":"tsg-xu-2274465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07397S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6693741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"6693741","articleId":"6596510","onlineDate":"12 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":6596515,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher T.

To combat this problem, this paper introduces an approach for predicting and eliminating such transient oscillations in pulsed PAs. Root causes for the transient oscillations are identified and contrasted with other time-domain pulse-distortion phenomena. Effective analytical techniques are presented for predicting transient instability during the PA design process. These techniques are demonstrated using a series of monolithic GaAs HBT Class-A and Class-C ultra-wideband (UWB) pulsed PA RF integrated circuits (RFICs). RFIC variants designed to exhibit no transient oscillations successfully show no such effects; RFIC variants designed without considering transient stability as a design tradeoff do indeed generate pulsed transients with measured oscillation frequencies and damping ratio parameters in less than 2% error with predictions. These results should greatly facilitate the design of pulsed transmitters for wideband/UWB communications and radar applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient analysis","Oscillators","Radio frequency","Stability analysis","Wideband","Modulation","Circuit stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterojunction bipolar transistors","power amplifiers","radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient oscillations","ultrawideband pulsed power amplifiers","pulsed radiofrequency output","monolithic HBT","RF integrated circuits","GaAs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microwave stability analysis","pulse modulation","radiofrequency integrated circuit (RFIC) design","ultra-wideband (UWB) technology"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2013.2280114","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6617737/06596515.pdf","startPage":"3733","endPage":"3742","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6617737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2013.2280114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Techniques for the Analysis and Elimination of Transient Oscillations in Wideband and Ultra-Wideband Pulsed Power Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Techniques for the Analysis and Elimination of Transient Oscillations in Wideband and Ultra-Wideband Pulsed Power Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596515/","volume":"61","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6596515/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13796762","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Techniques for the Analysis and Elimination of Transient Oscillations in Wideband and Ultra-Wideband Pulsed Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-rodenbeck-2280114-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081142S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6617737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6617737","articleId":"6596515","onlineDate":"12 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6596518,"authors":[{"name":"Guanghui Wen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6722960/6596518/6596518-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guanghui Wen (S'11\u2013M'13) received the B.Sc. degree in information and computing science from Liaoning Technical University, China, in 2005, the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical systems and control from Peking University, China, in 2012.","From December 2009 to March 2010, November 2010 to February 2011, May 2011 to July 2011, and December 2011 to March 2012, he was a Research Assistant in the City University of Hong Kong.

The main contribution of this work is solving the consensus tracking problem without the assumption that the topology among followers is strongly connected and fixed. By using tools from M-matrix theory, a class of consensus tracking protocols based only on the relative states among neighboring agents is designed. By appropriately constructing Lyapunov function, it is proved that consensus tracking in the closed-loop multi-agent systems with a fixed topology having a directed spanning tree can be achieved if the feedback gain matrix and the coupling strength are suitably selected. Furthermore, with the assumption that each possible topology contains a directed spanning tree, it is theoretically shown that consensus tracking under switching directed topologies can be achieved if the control parameters are suitably selected and the dwell time is larger than a positive threshold. The results are then extended to the case where the communication topology contains a directed spanning tree only frequently as the system evolves with time. Finally, some numerical simulations are given to verify the theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2268091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6722960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2268091","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6722960/06596518.pdf","startPage":"499","endPage":"511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consensus Tracking of Multi-Agent Systems With Lipschitz-Type Node Dynamics and Switching Topologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Consensus Tracking of Multi-Agent Systems With Lipschitz-Type Node Dynamics and Switching Topologies","volume":"61","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6596518/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14056325","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596518/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus Tracking of Multi-Agent Systems With Lipschitz-Type Node Dynamics and Switching Topologies","sourcePdf":"tcsi-wen-2268091-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17244S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6722960","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"539","xplore-issue":"6722960","articleId":"6596518","onlineDate":"12 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-20"},{"_id":6596540,"authors":[{"name":"Gerard H.

The gains in MIMO capacity are sensitive to the presence of spatial and temporal correlation introduced by the radio environment. In this paper, we examine how MIMO capacity is influenced by a number of factors e.g., a) temporal correlation b) various combinations of low/high spatial correlations at either end, c) combined spatial and temporal correlations. In all cases, we compare the channel capacity that would be achievable under independent fading. We investigate the behaviour of \u201ccapacity fades,\u201d examine how often the capacity experiences the fades, develop a method to determine level crossing rates and average fade durations and relate these to antenna numbers. We also evaluate the influence of channel correlation on the capacity autocorrelation and assess the fit of a Gaussian random process to the temporal capacity sequence. Finally we note that the particular spatial correlation structure of the MIMO channel is influenced by a large number of factors. For simplicity, it is desirable to use a single overall correlation measure which parameterizes the effect of correlation on capacity. We verify this single parameter concept by simulating a large number of different spatially correlated channels.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2003.6596556","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596555/06596556.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2003.6596556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596555","startPage":"104","endPage":"115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO capacity, level crossing rates and fades: The impact of spatial/temporal channel correlation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596556","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","displayDocTitle":"MIMO capacity, level crossing rates and fades: The impact of spatial/temporal channel correlation","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596556/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2003","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2003","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6596556/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO capacity, level crossing rates and fades: The impact of spatial/temporal channel correlation","sourcePdf":"104.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074211S","chronDate":"June  2003","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6596555","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6596555","articleId":"6596556","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"KICS","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596557,"authors":[{"name":"Mathini Sellathurai","affiliation":["Communications Research Centre, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6596555/6596557/6596557-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mathini Sellathurai received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, in 2001, and the Technical Licentiate degree in electrical engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 1997.

Furthermore, it is assumed that the receiver knows the instantaneous fading channel states but the transmitter does not have access to them. It is well known that, in theory, minimum-mean-square error (MMSE) based successive decoding of multiple access (in multi-user communications) and MIMO channels achieves the total channel capacity. However, for this scheme to perform optimally, the optimal rates of each antenna (per-antenna rates) must be known at the transmitter. We show that the optimal per-antenna rates at the transmitter can be estimated using only the statistical characteristics of the MIMO channel in time-varying Rayleigh MIMO channel environments. Based on the results, multirate codes are designed using punctured turbo codes for a horizontal coded MIMO system. Simulation results show performances within about one to two dBs of MIMO channel capacity.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2003.6596557","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596555/06596557.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2003.6596557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approaching near-capacity on a multi-antenna channel using successive decoding and interference cancellation receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2003","displayDocTitle":"Approaching near-capacity on a multi-antenna channel using successive decoding and interference cancellation receivers","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6596557/","volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2003","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approaching near-capacity on a multi-antenna channel using successive decoding and interference cancellation receivers","sourcePdf":"116.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038258S","chronDate":"June  2003","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6596555","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6596555","articleId":"6596557","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"KICS","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6596558,"authors":[{"name":"Marvin K.

The performance of asynchronous as well as synchronous system is studied over a correlated Rayleigh multipath slow fading channel. A simplified array-processing algorithm suitable for slow fading situation is investigated to overcome the heavy computational complexity associated with Eigen solutions. The effect of variable data rate in the system performance is considered and effectiveness of antenna array to handle high data rate is discussed. A brief investigation on the system performance degradation due to correlated channel is also carried out. Based on the extensive simulation carried out, the performance of the asynchronous uplink system is found dramatically improved with antenna array and multiuser detection. Asynchronicity and channel correlation are found to affect the system performance significantly. The investigated simplified algorithm produces similar results as Eigen solutions in slow fading situation with much reduced complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of multicarrier-CDMA uplink with antenna arrays and multiuser detection","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2003.6596561","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596555/06596561.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2003.6596561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  2003","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2003","displayDocTitle":"Performance of multicarrier-CDMA uplink with antenna arrays and multiuser detection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6596561/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","publicationDate":"June 2003","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of multicarrier-CDMA uplink with antenna arrays and multiuser detection","sourcePdf":"150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058766S","chronDate":"June  2003","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6596555","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","xplore-issue":"6596555","articleId":"6596561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596565,"authors":[{"name":"Ezio Biglieri","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6596555/6596565/6596565-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ezio Biglieri was born in Aosta (Italy).

The rotational invariance is a good property to have that may alleviate the task of the carrier phase tracking circuit in the receiver. The transmitted data stream is segmented into eight bit blocks and quadrature amplitude modulated using a 256 point 4-D signal constellation whose 2-D constituent constellation is a 16 point square constellation doubly partitioned. The 4-D signal constellation is simply the Cartesian product of the 2-D signal constellation with itself and has 32 subsets. The partition is performed on one side into four subsets A, B, C, and D with increased minimum-squared Euclidian distance, and on the other side into four rings, where each ring includes four points of equal energy. We propose both linear and nonlinear ST trellis codes and perform simulations using an appropriate multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel model. The 4-D ST codes constructed here demonstrate about the same frame error rate (FER) performance as their 2-D counterparts, having however the added value of rotational invariance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2004","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596582/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2004","volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6596582/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Rotationally invariant space-time trellis codes with 4-D rectangular constellations for high data rate wireless communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rotationally invariant space-time trellis codes with 4-D rectangular constellations for high data rate wireless communications","sourcePdf":"258.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127397S","chronDate":"Sept.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6596574","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6596574","articleId":"6596582","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596597,"authors":[{"name":"Serge Willenegger","affiliation":["Qualcomm International, Inc., Switzerland"],"firstName":"Serge","lastName":"Willenegger","id":"37418499000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1229-2370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1976-5541"}],"articleNumber":"6596597","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":378},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Physical layer","Synchronization","Bandwidth","Transmitting antennas","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3G","IMT-2000","radio interface","CDMA","CDMA-MC","cdma2000","IS-95"]}],"abstract":"cdma2000 offers several enhancements as compared to TIA/EIA-95, although it remains fully compatible with TIA/EIA-95 systems and allows for a smooth migration from one to the other. Major new capability include: 1) connectivity to GSM-MAP in addition to IP and IS-41 networks; 2) new layering with new LAC and MAC architectures for improved service multiplexing and QoS management and efficient use of radio resource; 3) new bands and bandwidths of operation in support of various operator needs and constraints, as well as desire for a smooth and progressive migration to cdma2000; and 4) flexible channel structure in support of multiple services with various QoS and variable transmission rates at up to 1 Mbps per channel and 2 Mbps per user. Given the phenomenal success of wireless services and desire for higher rate wireless services, improved spectrum efficiency was a major design goal in the elaboration of cdma2000. Major capacity enhancing features include: 1) turbo coding for data transmission; 2) fast forward link power control; 3) forward link transmit diversity; 4) support of directive antenna transmission techniques; 5) coherent reverse link structure; and 6) enhanced access channel operation. As users increasingly rely on their cell phone at work and at home for voice and data exchange, the stand-by time and operation-time are essential parameters that can influence customer's satisfaction and service utilization. Another major goal of cdma2000 was therefore to enable manufacturers to further optimize power utilization in the terminal. Major battery life enhancing features include: 1) improved reverse link performance (i.e., reduced transmit power per information bit); 2) new common channel structure and operation; 3) quick paging channel operation; 4) reverse link gated transmission; and 5) new MAC states for efficient and ubiquitous idle time operation. This article provides additional details on those enhancements. The intent is not to duplicate the detailed cdma2000 radio access network specification, but rather to provide some background on the new features of cdma2000 and on the qualitative improvements as compared to the TIA/EIA-95 based systems. The article is focused on the physical layer structure and associated procedures. It therefore does not cover the MAC, LAC, radio resource management [1], or any other signaling protocols in any detail. We assume some familiarity with the basic CDMA concepts used in TIA/EIA-95.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2000.6596597","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596593/06596597.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2000.6596597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"cdma2000 physical layer: An overview","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596597","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596597/","displayDocTitle":"cdma2000 physical layer: An overview","volume":"2","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"cdma2000 physical layer: An overview","sourcePdf":"5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047089S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"6596593","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"19","articleId":"6596597","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6596598,"authors":[{"name":"Byoung-Hoon Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byoung-Hoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37334268000"},{"name":"Byeong-Kook Jeong","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byeong-Kook","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37073917700"},{"name":"Byeong Gi Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byeong Gi","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281113300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1229-2370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1976-5541"}],"articleNumber":"6596598","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Correlation","Multiaccess communication","3G mobile communication","Spread spectrum communication","Generators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Correlation-aided distributed sample acquisition","state symbol correlation process","comparison-correction based synchronization process","primary synchronization code (PSC)","igniter code","3GPP 3-step synchronization approach"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce the correlation-aided distributed sample acquisition (CDSA) scheme for fast cell search in IMT-2000 W-CDMA cellular systems. The proposed scheme incorporates the state symbol correlation process into the comparison-correction based synchronization process of the original DSA scheme to enable fast acquisition even under very poor channel environment. For its realization, each mobile station (MS) has to store in its memory a set of state sample sequences, which are determined by the long-period scrambling sequences used in the system and the sampling interval of the state samples. CDSA based cell search is carried out in two stages: First, the MS first acquires the slot timing by using the primary synch code (PSC) and then identifies the igniter code which conveys the state samples of the current cell. Secondly, the MS identifies the scrambling code and frame timing by taking the comparison-correction based synchronization approach and, if the identification is not done satisfactorily within preset time, it initiates the state symbol correlation process which correlates the received symbol sequence with the pre-stored state sample sequences for a successful identification. As the state symbol SNR is relatively high, the state symbol correlation process enables reliable synchronization even in very low chip-SNR environment. Simulation results show that the proposed CDSA scheme outperforms the 3GPP 3-step approach, requiring the signal power of about 7 dB less for achieving the same acquisition time performance in low-SNR environment. Furthermore, it turns out very robust in the typical synchronization environment where large frequency offset exists.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2000.6596598","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596593/06596598.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2000.6596598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of correlation-aided DSA(CDSA) technique to fast cell search in IMT-2000 W-CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2000","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596598/","displayDocTitle":"Application of correlation-aided DSA(CDSA) technique to fast cell search in IMT-2000 W-CDMA systems","volume":"2","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2000","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of correlation-aided DSA(CDSA) technique to fast cell search in IMT-2000 W-CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"58.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02656S","chronDate":"March  2000","isNumber":"6596593","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6596598","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2000","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596612,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed S.

All four models have the same mathematical structure, differing only in their numerical parameters.

We extend some of our recent results in sampling of certain classes of parametric non-bandlimited signals and develop a frequency domain method for channel estimation and synchronization in ultra-wideband systems, which uses sub-Nyquist uniform sampling and well-studied computational procedures. In particular, the proposed method can be used for identification of more realistic channel models, where different propagation paths undergo different frequency-selective fading. Moreover, we show that it is possible to obtain high-resolution estimates of all relevant channel parameters by sampling a received signal below the traditional Nyquist rate. Our approach leads to faster acquisition compared to current digital solutions, allows for slower A/D converters, and potentially reduces power consumption of digital UWB receivers significantly.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2003.6596614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596610","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596610/06596614.pdf","endPage":"327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-sampling rate UWB channel characterization and synchronization","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2003.6596614","startPage":"319","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2003","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2003","displayDocTitle":"Low-sampling rate UWB channel characterization and synchronization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596614/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2003","htmlLink":"/document/6596614/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-sampling rate UWB channel characterization and synchronization","sourcePdf":"319.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066668S","chronDate":"Dec.  2003","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6596610","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6596610","articleId":"6596614","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596631,"authors":[{"name":"Bazil Taha-Ahmed","affiliation":["Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, ETSI de Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6596630/6596631/6596631-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bazil Taha-Ahmed was born in Mosul, Iraq, in 1960.

Adaptive modulated OFDM system is promising technique for increasing the throughput. In the pilot symbol assisted high-speed packet transmission system, the data symbol duration is generally considered to be small compared to the coherence time. However, OFDM symbol duration is longer than the symbol duration of a single carrier system, so that the packet duration of the pilot symbol assisted high speed packet transmission system is long. In this case, the change of channel conditions is too fast to be accurately estimated by channel estimator at the receiver in high Doppler frequency, so that many errors occur during demodulation, especially with the data symbols at the end of each packet. In this paper, we consider the BER at various instantaneous E\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">b</inf>\n/N\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</inf>\n that includes the demodulation errors in high Doppler frequency. When the coherence time is ten times longer than the duration of a single packet, the channel can be closely approximated as an AWGN channel. Otherwise, the approximation breaks down and the above-mentioned errors that occur during demodulation must be taken into consideration. In this paper, we propose the pilot symbol assisted high speed packet transmission system based on adaptive OFDM using a novel lookup table to consider the demodulated errors and evaluate the throughput performance.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2003.6596676","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596673/06596676.pdf","startPage":"25","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2003.6596676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot symbol assisted high speed packet transmission system based on adaptive OFDM in broadband mobile channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2003","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596676/","displayDocTitle":"Pilot symbol assisted high speed packet transmission system based on adaptive OFDM in broadband mobile channel","volume":"5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2003","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6596676/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot symbol assisted high speed packet transmission system based on adaptive OFDM in broadband mobile channel","sourcePdf":"25.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05889S","chronDate":"March  2003","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6596673","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","xplore-issue":"6596673","articleId":"6596676","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596677,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Buzzi","affiliation":["DAEIMI, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Cassino, Cassino, Frosinone, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6596673/6596677/6596677-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefano Buzzi was born in Piano di Sorrento, Italy on December 10, 1970.

The first stage of the receiver is a linear filter, aimed at suppressing the effect of the unwanted (i.e., out-of-group) users' signals, while the second stage is a non-linear block, implementing a ML detection rule on the set of desired users signals. As to the linear stage, we consider both the decorrelating and the minimum mean square error approaches. Interestingly, the proposed detection structure turns out to be a generalization of Varanasi's group detector, to which it reduces when the system is synchronous, the signatures are linearly independent and the first stage of the receiver is a decorrelator. The issue of blind adaptive receiver implementation is also considered, and implementations of the proposed receiver based on the LMS algorithm, the RLS algorithm and subspace-tracking algorithms are presented. These adaptive receivers do not rely on any knowledge on the out-of-group users' signals, and are thus particularly suited for rejection of out-of-cell interference in the base station. Simulation results confirm that the proposed structure achieves very satisfactory performance in comparison with previously derived receivers, as well as that the proposed blind adaptive algorithms achieve satisfactory performance.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2003.6596677","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596673/06596677.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2003.6596677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596673","startPage":"33","endPage":"42","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-stage ML-based group detection for direct-sequence CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","displayDocTitle":"Two-stage ML-based group detection for direct-sequence CDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596677/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2003","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2003","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6596677/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-stage ML-based group detection for direct-sequence CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"33.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082443S","chronDate":"March  2003","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6596673","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","xplore-issue":"6596673","articleId":"6596677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6596681,"authors":[{"name":"Hongrui Jiang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Technology and Telecommunications, Inha University, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6596673/6596681/6596681-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongrui Jiang received the BS degree in Microwave Telecommunication Engineering from Xidian University, Xian City, China in 1997, and the MS degree in Processing of Signal & Information from Guilin Institute of Electronic Technology, Guilin City, China in 2000, and the Ph.D degree in electronic telecommunication engineering from Inha University, Korea in 2003.

We show the solutions for the forward link channel powers by including fade margins to improve link reliability in lognormal shadowing.

We derive system capacity expressions as functions of link margins for specified reliability requirements and the corresponding minimum transmitter power levels.

While the primitive distributed sample acquisition(DSA) scheme can be employed only for the binary signaling systems which transmit one bit per symbol, the proposed BDSA scheme extends its applicability to the general signaling systems allowing multi-bit transmission per symbol. Since the BDSA contains the primitive DSA as a special case of M=2, it may be regarded as a generalized DSA system. For the construction of the BDSA system, we resort to the igniter sequence concept and the non-uniform sampling and correction scheme of the distributed sample scrambling(DSS). In the BDSA receiver the igniter sequence is synchronized first, which takes very short time due to its short period, and then the state symbol composed of log\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\nM state samples of the transmitter main shift register generator(SRG) is decoded successively and supplied for the synchronization of the receiver main SRG. The DSS technique imbedded in the BDSA scheme enables synchronizing the receiver main SRG in a few state symbol transmissions. Through a design study we confirm that the BDSA scheme contributes to speeding up the acquisition time as well as to saving the hardware cost by enabling the reuse of the data transceiver circuitry for the synchronization process.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596691/06596698.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"62","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/JCN.1999.6596698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.1999.6596698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596691","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596698","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Batch distributed sample acquisition for M-ary signaling DS/CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Vectors","Receivers","Connectors","Multiaccess communication","Nickel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Batch distributed sample acquisition(BDSA)","distributed sample acquisition(DSA)","igniter sequence","distributed sample scrambling(DSS)","shift register generator(SRG)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596698/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1999","displayDocTitle":"Batch distributed sample acquisition for M-ary signaling DS/CDMA systems","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1999","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Batch distributed sample acquisition for M-ary signaling DS/CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"52.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048791S","chronDate":"March  1999","isNumber":"6596691","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6596698","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596708,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph M.

The resulting detectors are termed as the array low-rate decorrelator (ALRD) and the array high-rate decorrelator (AHRD). In AHRD, maximal ratio combining on N consecutive decorrelated outputs is applied for the low-rate users. Asymptotic performance is compared numerically in the context of channel coding with two different types of spreading code assignments. In the worst-case random assignment, both detectors are sensitive to the interferers' directions of arrivals. Especially, performance degradation of the low-rate user is noticeable. In the cyclic assignment of the maximal-length shift register code for the low-rate users, ALRD is less sensitive to the spatial distributions of the interferers, whereas AHRD is sensitive to the distributions of the low-rate users and less sensitive to the distributions of the high-rate users. We confirm that both detectors show the near-far resistant property and good asymptotic performance depending on the spatial distributions of the interferers and spreading code assignments.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2001.6596793","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596789/06596793.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2001.6596793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596789","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded performance of dual-rate decorrelators combined with an array of antennas for synchronous multiuser DS/CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596793","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","displayDocTitle":"Coded performance of dual-rate decorrelators combined with an array of antennas for synchronous multiuser DS/CDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2001","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596793/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2001","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2001","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6596793/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded performance of dual-rate decorrelators combined with an array of antennas for synchronous multiuser DS/CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"219.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073289S","chronDate":"Sept.  2001","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6596789","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6596789","articleId":"6596793","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596794,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We consider approximations to the SINR expressions that are justified in typical operating scenarios to obtain a more intuitive understanding of the SINR performance of the HPIC detector. We consider the case where a specific SINR requirement is given for each user in the system and derive expressions for the set of transmit powers necessary to meet this requirement when two-stage LPIC or HPIC detection is used. We also derive expressions for a measure of the theoretical system capacity using LPIC and HPIC detection, defined as the maximum number of users possible in a system with finite available transmit power. Numerical results are presented that compare the HPIC and LPIC detectors to the hard-decision successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector and matched filter (MF) detector.

This approach fully utilizes all known users' information, performs interference cancellation (IC) to suppress the interferers within the cell, and exploits blind adaptive decision-directed (DD) MMSE detector to suppress the inter-cell interference. This process can be made iterative and in the multistage process, the tentative decision bits from DD-MMSE detectors can be fed back to the IC part to make interference regeneration more accurate. A simplified RLS (SRLS) algorithm is derived particularly for DD-MMSE detectors and steady-state SIR performance of the SRLS algorithm is analyzed. It is shown that the proposed detector with SRLS algorithm is sufficient to perform accurate multiuser detection and has significant performance gain over that of the pure blind detectors and the non-blind detectors for the given scenario. Moreover, compared with the conventional RLS algorithm, the SRLS algorithm has lower computational complexity and the convergence speed is faster. We also develop two group-blind channel estimation methods to estimate the effective signature waveforms in multipath fading channel. It is seen that the group-blind channel estimation methods using updated received signal correlation matrix can effectively combat the mismatch problem faced by pure blind detectors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multistage group-blind adaptive multiuser detector for reverse link in direct-sequence CDMA systems","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2001.6596795","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596789/06596795.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2001.6596795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596789","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596795/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2001","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2001","displayDocTitle":"Multistage group-blind adaptive multiuser detector for reverse link in direct-sequence CDMA systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6596795/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2001","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multistage group-blind adaptive multiuser detector for reverse link in direct-sequence CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"238.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05955S","chronDate":"Sept.  2001","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6596789","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6596789","articleId":"6596795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2001","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6596797,"authors":[{"name":"Marvin K.

The relative performance gain between Reed-Solomon (RS) code and convolutional code (CC) is well known in [1] for the single user, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. In this case, RS codes outperform CC's at high signal-to-noise ratios. We find that this is not the case for the multiuser interference channel mentioned above. For useful error rates, we find that soft-decision CC's to be uniformly better than RS codes when used with DS-CDMA modulation in multiuser space-time channels. In our development, we use the Gaussian approximation on the interference to determine performance error bounds for systems with low number of users. Then, we check their accuracy in error rate estimation via system's simulation. These performance bounds will in turn allow us to consider a large number of users where we can estimate the gain in user-capacity due to channel coding. Lastly, the use of turbo codes is considered where it is shown that they offer a coding gain of 2.5 dB relative to soft-decision CC.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2003.6596812","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596811/06596812.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2003.6596812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596811","startPage":"187","endPage":"196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error control coding and space-time MMSE multiuser detection in DS-CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596812","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","displayDocTitle":"Error control coding and space-time MMSE multiuser detection in DS-CDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2003","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596812/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2003","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2003","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6596812/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error control coding and space-time MMSE multiuser detection in DS-CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"187.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103367S","chronDate":"Sept.  2003","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6596811","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6596811","articleId":"6596812","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2003","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596833,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Hu","affiliation":["Nokia Mobile Phones A/S, San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6596830/6596833/6596833-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ming Hu received his Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University in Aug. 2004.

We first examine the impact of spatial diversity on the MAC design, and devise a MIMO MAC protocol accordingly. We then develop analytical methods to characterize the corresponding saturation throughput for MIMO multi-hop networks. Building on the throughout analysis, we study the impact of MIMO MAC on routing. We characterize the optimal hop distance that minimizes the end-to-end delay in a large network. For completeness, we also study MAC design using directional antennas for the case where the channel has a strong line of sight (LOS) component.

We develop a systematic methodology for studying this problem in the asymptotic region when the number of nodes n in the network is large. We first identify a number of key parameters for a large class of scheduling schemes, and investigate the inherent tradeoffs among the capacity, the delay, and these scheduling parameters. Based on these inherent tradeoffs, we are able to compute the upper bound on the maximum per-node capacity of a large mobile wireless network under given delay constraints. Further, in the process of proving the upper bound, we are able to identify the optimal values of the key scheduling parameters. Knowing these optimal values, we can then develop scheduling schemes that achieve the upper bound up to some logarithmic factor, which suggests that our upper bound is fairly tight. We have applied this methodology to both the i.i.d. mobility model and the random way-point mobility model. In both cases, our methodology allows us to develop new scheduling schemes that can achieve larger capacity than previous proposals under the same delay constraints. In particular, for the i.i.d. mobility model, our scheme can achieve \u0398(n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u22121/3</sup>\n/log\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3/2</sup>\n n) per-node capacity with constant delay.

Moreover, network-oriented feedbacks to handle route disconnection events may impair packet forwarding capability by adding to MAC layer congestion and also dissipate considerable network resources at reluctant intermediate nodes. Here, we propose a new TCP scheme that does not require the participation of intermediate nodes. It is a purely end-to-end scheme using TCP timestamps to deduce link conditions. It also eliminates spurious reductions of the transmission window in cases of timeouts and fast retransmits. The scheme incorporates a receiver-oriented rate controller (rater), and a congestion window delimiter for the 802.11 MAC protocol. In addition, the transient nature of medium availability due to medium contention during the connection time is addressed by a freezing timer (freezer) at the receiver, which freezes the sender whenever heavy contention is perceived. Finally, the sender-end is modified to comply with the receiver-end enhancements, as an optional deployment. Simulation studies show that our modification of TCP for ad hoc networks offers outstanding performance in terms of goodput, as well as throughput.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Receivers","Throughput","Delays","Bandwidth","Routing protocols"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["End-to-end rate control","Freeze TCP","receiver advertised window","TCP timestamps","802.11 MAC"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JCN.2004.6596838","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596830/06596838.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2004.6596838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient transport protocol for ad hoc networks: An end-to-end freeze TCP with timestamps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596838","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","displayDocTitle":"An efficient transport protocol for ad hoc networks: An end-to-end freeze TCP with timestamps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596838/","volume":"6","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2004","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6596838/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2004","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  2004","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient transport protocol for ad hoc networks: An end-to-end freeze TCP with timestamps","sourcePdf":"376.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077008S","chronDate":"Dec.  2004","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6596830","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","xplore-issue":"6596830","articleId":"6596838","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596858,"authors":[{"name":"L.

However, due to unknown multipath distortion, different interferences may exist in the received data, such as multiuser interference, intersymbol interference and interblock interference. To estimate channel parameters for a desired user, we employ all structured signature waveforms associated with different symbols of that user and apply subspace techniques. Therefore better performance of channel estimator can be achieved than the conventional subspace method based only on the signature of the current symbol. The delay for that user can also be jointly estimated. Channel identifiability conditions and asymptotic channel estimation error are investigated in detail.

Several rate scheduling algorithms are developed, the common factor of which is that part of the decision on which users to serve is based on a function of the deadline of their head-of-line packets. An approach of Andrews et al., in which the basic Earliest-Deadline-First algorithm is studied for similar systems, is extended to result in better performance by considering a more efficient power usage and by allowing service of more than one user per timeslot if the power resources permit it.

MCN preserves the benefit of conventional single-hop cellular networks (SCN) where the service infrastructure is constructed by fixed bases or access points (APs), and it also incorporates the flexibility of ad-hoc networks where wireless transmission through mobile stations in multiple hops is allowed. MCN can reduce the required number of bases or APs and improve the throughput performance, while limiting path vulnerability encountered in ad-hoc networks. In addition, MCN and SCN are analyzed, in terms of mean hop count, hop-by-hop throughput, end-to-end throughput, and mean number of channels (i.e., simultaneous transmissions) under different traffic localities and transmission ranges. Numerical results demonstrate that throughput of MCN exceeds that of SCN and the former also increases as the transmission range decreases. The above results can be accounted for by the different orders, linear and square, at which mean hop count and mean number of channels increase, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2002.6596930","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596927/06596930.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2002.6596930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multihop cellular: A novel architecture for wireless data communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2002","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596930/","displayDocTitle":"Multihop cellular: A novel architecture for wireless data communications","volume":"4","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2002","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6596930/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multihop cellular: A novel architecture for wireless data communications","sourcePdf":"30.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063393S","chronDate":"March  2002","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6596927","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6596927","articleId":"6596930","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2002","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596948,"authors":[{"name":"Sang G.

Each user employs a rate 1/n convolutional code for channel coding for the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The array receiver structure is composed of beamformers in the users' directions followed by a bank of matched filters. The decoder is implemented using a Viterbi algorithm whose states depend on the number of users and the constraint length of the convolutional code. The asymptotic array multiuser coding gain (AAMCG) is defined to encompass the asymptotic multiuser coding gain and the spatial information on users' locations in the system. We derive the upper and lower bounds of the AAMCG. As an example, the upper and lower bounds of AAMCG are obtained for the two user case where each user employes the maximum free distance convolutional code with rate 1/2. The near-far resistance property is also investigated considering the number of antenna elements and user separations in the space.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596943/06596948.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"188","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/JCN.1999.6596948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.1999.6596948","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596943","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6596948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic performance of ML sequence estimator using an array of antennas for coded synchronous multiuser DS-CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Maximum likelihood estimation","Antenna arrays","Vectors","Encoding","Measurement","Convolutional codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel coding","jointly maximum-likelihood sequence estimation","multiuser detection","asymptotic array multiuser coding gain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596948/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1999","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1999","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic performance of ML sequence estimator using an array of antennas for coded synchronous multiuser DS-CDMA systems","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1999","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic performance of ML sequence estimator using an array of antennas for coded synchronous multiuser DS-CDMA systems","sourcePdf":"182.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029904S","chronDate":"Sept.  1999","isNumber":"6596943","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"9","articleId":"6596948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1999","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6596983,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Mississippi, University Park, MS, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6596981/6596983/6596983-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Cao received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from Hefei University of Technology, China in 1990, the M.S. degree in computer science from University of Science and Technology of China in 1993, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from University of Missouri-Columbia in 2002.

First, the initial blind channel estimation is accomplished by incorporating the list parallel Viterbi algorithm with the least mean square (LMS) updating approach. In this operation, multiple trellis mappings are preserved simultaneously and ranked in terms of path metrics. Equivalently, multiple channel estimates are maintained and updated once a single symbol is received. Second, the best channel estimate from the above operation will be adopted to set up the whole trellis. The conventional adaptive Viterbi algorithm is then applied to detect the signal and further update the channel estimate alternately. A small delay is introduced for the symbol detection and the decision feedback to smooth the noise impact. An automatic switch between the above two operations is also proposed by exploiting the evolution of path metrics and the linear constraint inherent in the trellis mapping. Simulation has shown an overall excellent performance of the proposed scheme in terms of mean square error (MSE) for channel estimation, robustness to the initial channel guess, computational complexity, and channel equalization.","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/6596981/06596983.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"25","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2004.6596983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2004.6596983","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A trellis-based technique for blind channel estimation and equalization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6596983/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2004","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2004","displayDocTitle":"A trellis-based technique for blind channel estimation and equalization","htmlLink":"/document/6596983/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2004","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2013","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A trellis-based technique for blind channel estimation and equalization","sourcePdf":"19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047249S","chronDate":"March  2004","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6596981","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6596981","articleId":"6596983","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2004","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6597113,"authors":[{"name":"Jack Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science at the College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Li","id":"37899055300"},{"name":"Qingyang Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science at the College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Qingyang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37714565300"},{"name":"Deepal Jayasinghe","affiliation":["School of Computer Science at the College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Deepal","lastName":"Jayasinghe","id":"37670800600"},{"name":"Junhee Park","affiliation":["School of Computer Science at the College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Junhee","lastName":"Park","id":"37677898000"},{"name":"Tao Zhu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science at the College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37074187700"},{"name":"Calton Pu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science at the College of Computing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Calton","lastName":"Pu","id":"37279927300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5006-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-7703"}],"articleNumber":"6597113","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":939},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Virtual machine monitors","Throughput","Market research","Virtual machining","Virtualization","Radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","parallel programming","virtual machines","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance overhead","cloud environment","Hadoop MapReduce benchmark","Xen hypervisor","KVM hypervisor","commercial hypervisor","workload type","workload size","VM placement","virtual machine","Word Count benchmark","TestDSFIO benchmark","TeraSort benchmark"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hypervisors","virtualization","hadoop","mapreduce","performance comparison"]}],"abstract":"Hyper visors are widely used in cloud environments and their impact on application performance has been a topic of significant research and practical interest. We conducted experimental measurements of several benchmarks using Hadoop MapReduce to evaluate and compare the performance impact of three popular hyper visors: a commercial hyper visor, Xen, and KVM. We found that differences in the workload type (CPU or I/O intensive), workload size and VM placement yielded significant performance differences among the hyper visors. In our study, we used the three hyper visors to run several MapReduce benchmarks, such as Word Count, TestDSFIO, and TeraSort and further validated our observed hypothesis using micro benchmarks. In our observation for CPU-bound benchmark, the performance difference between the three hyper visors was negligible, however, significant performance variations were seen for I/O-bound benchmarks. Moreover, adding more virtual machines on the same physical host degraded the performance on all three hyper visors, yet we observed different degradation trends amongst them. Concretely, the commercial hyper visor is 46% faster at TestDFSIO Write than KVM, but 49% slower in the TeraSort benchmark. In addition, increasing the workload size for TeraSort yielded completion times for CVM that were two times that of Xen and KVM.

Cloud computing provides a way to enable massive amounts of data to work together as data-intensive services. Considering Big Data and the cloud together, which is a practical and economical way to deal with Big Data, will accelerate the availability and acceptability of analysis of the data. Providing an efficient mechanism for optimized data-intensive services will become critical to meet the expected growth in demand. Because the competition is an extremely important factor in the marketplace, the cost model for data-intensive service provision is the key to provide a sustainable service market. As data play the dominant role in execution of data-intensive service composition, the cost and access response time of data sets influence the quality of the service that requires the data sets. In this paper, a data replica selection optimization algorithm based on an ant colony system is proposed. The performance of the data replica selection algorithm is evaluated by simulations. The background application of the work is the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer experiment, which involves large amounts of data being transferred, organized and stored. It is critical and challenging to be cost and time aware to manage the data and services in this intensive research environment.","doi":"10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.41","startPage":"247","endPage":"254","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.41","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6597101","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596172/6597101/06597144.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost and Time Aware Ant Colony Algorithm for Data Replica in Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer Experiment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6597144/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cost and Time Aware Ant Colony Algorithm for Data Replica in Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer Experiment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6597144/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13769445","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2013-July 2 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost and Time Aware Ant Colony Algorithm for Data Replica in Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer Experiment","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5006a247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071069S","chronDate":"June 27 2013-July 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596172","isNumber":"6597101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596172","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6597101","articleId":"6597144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6597149,"authors":[{"name":"Apostolos Papageorgiou","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories Europe, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Apostolos","lastName":"Papageorgiou","id":"37316703400"},{"name":"Mischa Schmidt","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories Europe, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Mischa","lastName":"Schmidt","id":"37287288500"},{"name":"Jaeseung Song","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories Europe, Heidelberg, Germany"],"firstName":"Jaeseung","lastName":"Song","id":"37085405993"},{"name":"Nobuharu Kami","affiliation":["NEC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuharu","lastName":"Kami","id":"37713334500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5006-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-7703"}],"articleNumber":"6597149","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":309},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Filtering","Information management","Data handling","Data storage systems","Sensors","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","information filtering","information filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart M2M data filtering","domain-specific filtering thresholds","domain-agnostic platforms","machine-to-machine platform","globally-intended multilayer solutions","technology-specific tasks","data-handling systems","Big Data","data selection","filtering logic","filtering flows","filtering algorithm","heterogeneous filters","utility-monitoring domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["M2M","filtering","Big Data","platform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6597149","abstract":"Due to the demand for homogeneous, intelligent, and automated access to data measured anywhere and from any device, Machine-to-Machine (M2M) platforms are evolving as globally-intended multi-layer solutions that provide such access, abstracting from all technology-specific tasks. In order to preserve the stability of their potentially huge data-handling systems and the usefulness of their Big Data, M2M platforms must maintain some data selection and filtering logic. A challenge that appears in modern M2M platforms is related to the decoupling of the front end (devices, area networks) from the backend (applications, databases). Because of this decoupling, domain-specific tricks cannot be applied any more for filtering at the front end. This paper presents a solution using domain-specific filtering thresholds in a domain-agnostic platform, as well as filtering flows and algorithms tailored to modern M2M platforms. Their combination assembles the first filtering solution that supports the unified handling of heterogeneous filters. In an evaluation from the utility-monitoring domain, instances of our approach showed high efficiency of configuration and were the only ones to achieve, for example, forwarding less than 25% of the captured data maintaining a coverage ratio bigger than 50% for all considered applications.","doi":"10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData.Congress.2013.45","startPage":"286","endPage":"293","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596172/6597101/06597149.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Congress on Big Data","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6597101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart M2M Data Filtering Using Domain-Specific Thresholds in Domain-Agnostic Platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2013-July 2 2013","displayDocTitle":"Smart M2M Data Filtering Using Domain-Specific Thresholds in Domain-Agnostic Platforms","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6597149/","accessionNumber":"13769430","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6597149/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart M2M Data Filtering Using Domain-Specific Thresholds in Domain-Agnostic Platforms","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5006a286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058415S","chronDate":"June 27 2013-July 2 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596172","isNumber":"6597101","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596172","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6597101","articleId":"6597149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6597158,"authors":[{"name":"Lijuan Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Systems and Technology, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Lijuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"38248087500"},{"name":"Jun Shen","affiliation":["School of Information Systems and Technology, University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Shen","id":"37279547000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5006-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-7703"}],"articleNumber":"6597158","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Quality of service","Optimization","Sociology","Statistics","Genetic algorithms","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","genetic algorithms","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["economical data-intensive service provision","genetic algorithm","digital data","data-intensive service composition solution","negotiation process","crossover operator","mutation operator","local optima","Web services"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data-intensive service composition","genetic algorithm","quality of service"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6597158","abstract":"The explosion of digital data and the dependence on data-intensive services have been recognized as the most significant characteristics of the decade.

In particular, we discuss to what extent the elicitation of security requirements and the Y-chart partitioning approach, a central design methodology in embedded systems, can mutually enrich each other. We also show how SysML, which is already commonly used to engineer requirements in embedded systems, can also represent security requirements, assets, and threats with only a few extensions and thus support a more comprehensive requirements engineering methodology. We illustrate the use of our overall methodology and toolkit with examples from the automotive embedded system field in order to demonstrate the relevance of our approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6597254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MoDRE.2013.6597264","publicationTitle":"2013 3rd International Workshop on Model-Driven Requirements Engineering (MoDRE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 3rd International Workshop on Model-Driven Requirements Engineering (MoDRE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589046/6597254/06597264.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"64","doi":"10.1109/MoDRE.2013.6597264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards the model-driven engineering of security requirements for embedded systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-15 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Towards the model-driven engineering of security requirements for embedded systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-15 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6597264/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13769325","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6597264/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards the model-driven engineering of security requirements for embedded systems","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"p55roudier.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069098S","chronDate":"15-15 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589046","isNumber":"6597254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589046","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6597254","articleId":"6597264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6597290,"authors":[{"name":"Meihua Bi","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratoryof Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Meihua Bi","id":"38010876800"},{"name":"Hao He","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratoryof Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Hao He","id":"37404582300"},{"name":"Shilin Xiao","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratoryof Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Shilin Xiao","id":"37404041900"},{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratoryof Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jun Li","id":"37598871100"},{"name":"Weisheng Hu","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratoryof Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Weisheng Hu","id":"37273483200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-271-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-8507"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-8515"}],"articleNumber":"6597290","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"abstract":"A symmetric 40-Gb/s stacked WDM-OFDM-PON system by using our designed TBF for downstream wavelength selection and upstream chirp management is experimentally demonstrated.

This image sensor includes photodiodes, pixel sensing circuits, sense amplifiers, pixel-activated decoders, Time-to-Digital Converters (TDC) and a TDC readout unit. A negative feedback mechanism in pixel sensing circuits is used to accelerate sensing response. The bus-shared topology is employed to minimize the overhead of parallel reading. By using the TSMC 0.35\u03bcm CMOS technology, a 44\u00d736-pixel 3D image sensor was successfully implemented to have detection speed of 32ns and depth resolution up to 4 cm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-efficiency 3D CMOS image sensor","publicationTitle":"2013 18th OptoElectronics and Communications Conference held jointly with 2013 International Conference on Photonics in Switching (OECC/PS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 18th OptoElectronics and Communications Conference held jointly with 2013 International Conference on Photonics in Switching (OECC/PS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589034/6597268/06597546.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6597268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6597546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6597546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2013-July 4 2013","displayDocTitle":"High-efficiency 3D CMOS image sensor","conferenceDate":"30 June-4 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6597546/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13768798","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-efficiency 3D CMOS image sensor","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"1843TuPK1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063853S","chronDate":"June 30 2013-July 4 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589034","isNumber":"6597268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589034","xplore-issue":"6597268","articleId":"6597546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6597567,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Nowadays, more and more bloggers are willing to share information with others. Therefore, it is desirable that related blogs can be connected. Clustering is often used for establishing connections between blogs. Full-text keywords retrieval process (FKRP) is generally used to obtain the keywords of posts, and the keywords were then used to cluster posts. Another approach is to use tags or categories chosen by bloggers for their posts. However, the overhead of FKRP is relatively high and the use of tagging is associated with synonymy related issues. More recently, there is an emerging concept called social tagging, which is about having web resources tagged by the general public together. Similar to this concept, we developed a blog connect platform that collects queried keywords used by the people for searching for a post. With the queried keywords, formal concept analysis (FCA) associated with agglomerative hierarchical clustering method is used to cluster posts. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the proposed approach is better than those of other studies.","doi":"10.1109/ISBAST.2013.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6597649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBAST.2013.3","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Biometrics and Security Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Biometrics and Security Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6597099/6597649/06597658.pdf","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Blog Clustering Approach Based on Queried Keywords","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6597658/","displayDocTitle":"A Blog Clustering Approach Based on Queried Keywords","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13769539","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6597658/","publicationDate":"July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Blog Clustering Approach Based on Queried Keywords","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"5010a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050602S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6597099","isNumber":"6597649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6597099","xplore-issue":"6597649","articleId":"6597658","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6597679,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulhaseeb Ahmed","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Air University, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Abdulhaseeb","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37088407194"},{"name":"Hafiz Malik","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Michigan-Dearborn, Dearborn, USA"],"firstName":"Hafiz","lastName":"Malik","id":"38528002900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5314-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-5010-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6597679","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iris recognition","Robustness","Databases","Access control","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy","image coding","iris recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics security","multimodal approach","BACS","biometric based access control system","identity verification","privacy concern","biometric template","human iris template security","channel coding","low density parity check coding","CASIA database","access control process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biometric","Security","Privacy","BACS","Channel Coding","LDPC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6597679","doi":"10.1109/ISBAST.2013.24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBAST.2013.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6597649","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Biometrics and Security Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Biometrics and Security Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6597099/6597649/06597679.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security of Biometrics Using Multimodal Approach","abstract":"Biometric based access control systems (BACS) are widely used for robust and reliable identity verification, but these systems also raise some serious privacy concerns. The biometric templates, used for access control process, are stored in the system database which is vulnerable to variety of attacks. This paper presents a two stage solution for securing human iris templates used for BACS. The proposed method first models the fuzziness of iris template bits, which is used to select a set of stable template bits. Channel coding based on low density parity check coding is then applied to the selected stable bits to protect template against adversary attacks. To enhance the security of the proposed method further, both human irises are used for the access control process. Security performance of the developed algorithm is evaluated using publicly available CASIA database.

Computing services, such as data, storage, software, computing, and application, are delivered to local devices through Internet. The major security issue of cloud computing is that the cloud provider must ensure that their infrastructure is secure, and that prevent illegal data accesses from outsiders, other clients, or even the unauthorized cloud employees. In this paper, we deal with cloud security services including key agreement and authentication. By using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and symmetric bivariate polynomial based secret sharing, we design the secure cloud computing (SCC). Two types of SCC are proposed. One requires a trusted third party (TTP), and the other does not need a TTP. Also, our SCC can be extended to multi-server SCC (MSCC) to fit an environment, where each multi-server system contains multiple servers to collaborate for serving applications. Due to the strong security and operation efficiency, the proposed SCC and MSCC are extremely suitable for use in cloud computing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Biometrics and Security Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6597099/6597649/06597700.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"266","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Biometrics and Security Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ISBAST.2013.46","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBAST.2013.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6597649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6597700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protecting Data Privacy and Security for Cloud Computing Based on Secret Sharing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Authentication","Polynomials","Cryptography","Cloud computing","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data privacy","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data privacy protection","data security","secure cloud computing","symmetric bivariate polynomial based secret sharing","Internet-based computing","cloud security services","key agreement","authentication","elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman","ECDH","trusted third party","TTP","multiserver SCC","MSCC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","authentication","secret sharing","key agreement","symmetric bivariate polynomial","homomorphism"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6597700/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Protecting Data Privacy and Security for Cloud Computing Based on Secret Sharing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6597700/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13769519","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","conferenceDate":"2-5 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protecting Data Privacy and Security for Cloud Computing Based on Secret Sharing","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"5010a259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094269S","chronDate":"2-5 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6597099","isNumber":"6597649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6597099","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6597649","articleId":"6597700","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6597747,"authors":[{"name":"Dmitry Gavinsky","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Dmitry","lastName":"Gavinsky","id":"38053417500"},{"name":"Tsuyoshi Ito","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Tsuyoshi","lastName":"Ito","id":"38527906800"},{"name":"Guoming Wang","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories America Inc, Princeton, NJ, US"],"firstName":"Guoming","lastName":"Wang","id":"37074232400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4997-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1093-0159"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0159"}],"articleNumber":"6597747","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"abstract":"We study shared randomness in the context of multi-party number-in-hand communication protocols in the simultaneous message passing model. We show that with three or more players, shared randomness exhibits new interesting properties that have no direct analogues in the two-party case. First, we demonstrate a hierarchy of modes of shared randomness, with the usual shared randomness where all parties access the same random string as the strongest form in the hierarchy. We show exponential separations between its levels, and some of our bounds may be of independent interest. For example, we show that the equality function can be solved by a protocol of constant length using the weakest form of shared randomness, which we call XOR-shared randomness. Second, we show that quantum communication cannot replace shared randomness in the k-party case, where k \u2265 3 is any constant. We demonstrate a promise function GP\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</sub>\n that can be computed by a classical protocol of constant length when (the strongest form of) shared randomness is available, but any quantum protocol without shared randomness must send n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u03a9(1)</sup>\n qubits to compute it.

Due to its flexible and adaptive ability, EHW-based solutions receive a lot of attention in industrial applications. One of the obstacles to realize an EHW-based method is its very long training time. This study deals with the parallelism of EHW-based design of image filters using graphic processing units (GPUs). The design process is analyzed and decomposed into some smaller processes that can run in parallel. Pixel-based data for training and verifying EHW solutions are partitioned according to the architecture of GPU. Several strategies for deploying parallel processes are developed and implemented. With the proposed method, significant improvements on the efficiency of training EHW models are gained. Using a GPU with 240 cores, a speedup of 64 times is obtained.

Owing to attractive features of USMs, they are expected to be applied widely in industrial world. However, in the applications of USMs, control performances are limited by characteristic variation and nonlinearity of USMs. To overcome the problems, many control methods have been proposed in previous research. In this paper, a scheme of internal model control (IMC)-PID control combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO) type neural network (NN) is studied for control of USM. In the method, an NN controller is designed for adjusting the control parameter in IMC-PID controller. Meanwhile, the weights of NN are updated by PSO algorithm on-line. By employing the proposed method, the characteristic changes and nonlinearity of USM can be ompensated. On the other hand, the application of PSO algorithm in NN's learning avoids the problem of Jacobian estimation in conventional NNs which apply back-propagation (BP) method. The effectiveness of the method is confirmed by experiments.","doi":"10.1109/SNPD.2013.66","pdfPath":"/iel7/6598367/6598425/06598527.pdf","startPage":"605","endPage":"610","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 14th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing","publicationTitle":"2013 14th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2013.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6598425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent Control of Ultrasonic Motor Using PSO Type Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6598527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Intelligent Control of Ultrasonic Motor Using PSO Type Neural Network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13769645","publicationDate":"July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6598527/","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent Control of Ultrasonic Motor Using PSO Type Neural Network","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"5005a605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061801S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6598367","isNumber":"6598425","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6598367","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6598425","articleId":"6598527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6598528,"authors":[{"name":"Huimin Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Huimin","lastName":"Lu","id":"37533922000"},{"name":"Yujie Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Yujie","lastName":"Li","id":"38482077900"},{"name":"Shota Nakashima","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Yamaguchi University, Ube, Japan"],"firstName":"Shota","lastName":"Nakashima","id":"37531245000"},{"name":"Shiyuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Shiyuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37598423800"},{"name":"Lifeng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Kyushu Institute of Technology, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292623600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5005-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6598528","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiresolution analysis","Biomedical imaging","Image fusion","Indexes","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","image fusion","image reconstruction","image resolution","medical image processing","trees (mathematics)","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiframe medical images enhancement","dual tree complex wavelet transform domain","multiresolution analysis tool","multiresolution expansion","directional expansion","medical image fusion","weighted soft threshold","DTCWT reconstruction","human visual analysis","quantitative analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image fusion","dual tree complex wavelet transform","medical image"]}],"abstract":"As a novel of multi-resolution analysis tool, dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) provides flexible multiresolution and directional expansion for medical image fusion.

Although recent studies have primarily focused on harnessing live migration of VMs to achieve load balancing and power saving among different servers, there has been little attention on the incurred performance interference and cost on both source and destination servers during and after such VM migration. To avoid potential violations of service-level-agreement (SLA) demanded by cloud applications, this paper proposes iAware, a lightweight interference-aware VM live migration strategy. It empirically captures the essential relationships between VM performance interference and key factors that are practically accessible through realistic experiments of benchmark workloads on a Xen virtualized cluster platform. iAware jointly estimates and minimizes both migration and co-location interference among VMs, by designing a simple multi-resource demand-supply model. Extensive experiments and complementary large-scale simulations are conducted to validate the performance gain and runtime overhead of iAware in terms of I/O and network throughput, CPU consumption, and scalability, compared to the traditional interference-unaware VM migration approaches. Moreover, we demonstrate that iAware is flexible enough to cooperate with existing VM scheduling or consolidation policies in a complementary manner, such that the load balancing or power saving can still be achieved without sacrificing performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2013.185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6948290","startPage":"3012","endPage":"3025","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/6948290/06598665.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"iAware: Making Live Migration of Virtual Machines Interference-Aware in the Cloud","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6598665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6598665/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"iAware: Making Live Migration of Virtual Machines Interference-Aware in the Cloud","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14710056","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"iAware: Making Live Migration of Virtual Machines Interference-Aware in the Cloud","sourcePdf":"tc-liu-185-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098451S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6948290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"128","xplore-issue":"6948290","articleId":"6598665","onlineDate":"13 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6598666,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Le","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6980145/6598666/6598666-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuan Le received the MS degree in computer science from The George Washington University in 2010.

Because the notion of fairness is not universal and there lacks a rigorous analysis on the relationships among the four types of most popular fairness criteria, we first mathematically prove that there exist certain connections between these types of fairness criteria. We then propose an efficient medium access algorithm that aims at achieving time fairness and throughput enhancement in a fully distributed manner. The core idea of our proposed algorithm lies in that each station needs to select an appropriate contention window size so as to fairly share the channel occupancy time and maximize the throughput under the time fairness constraint.

This paper presents PERFUME, a system that simultaneously guarantees power and performance targets with flexible tradeoffs and service differentiation among co-hosted applications while assuring control accuracy and system stability. Based on the proposed fuzzy MIMO control technique, it effectively controls both the throughput and percentile-based response time of multi-tier applications due to its novel self-adaptive fuzzy modeling that integrates the strengths of fuzzy logic, MIMO control and artificial neural network. Furthermore, we address an important challenge of pro-actively avoiding violations of power and performance targets in anticipation of future workload changes. We implement PERFUME in a testbed of virtualized blade servers hosting multi-tier RUBiS applications. Performance evaluation based on synthetic and real-world Web workloads demonstrates its control accuracy, flexibility in selecting tradeoffs between conflicting targets, service differentiation capability and robustness against highly dynamic and bursty workloads. It outperforms a representative utility based approach in providing guarantee of the system throughput, percentile-based response time and power budget.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/6980145/06598671.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2013.184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2013.184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980145","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6598671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Power and Performance Guarantee with Fuzzy MIMO Control in Virtualized Server Clusters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Power demand","MIMO","Time factors","Adaptation models","Accuracy","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","Internet","MIMO systems","power aware computing","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinated power","performance guarantee","fuzzy MIMO control","multiple input multiple output control","multi-tier Internet applications","power consumption","virtualized server clusters","PERFUME system","artificial neural network","fuzzy logic","virtualized blade servers","representative utility based approach","system throughput","percentile-based response time","power budget"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power budget","performance guarantee","multi-tier internet services","fuzzy MIMO control","proactive control","self adaptation","server virtualization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6598671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Power and Performance Guarantee with Fuzzy MIMO Control in Virtualized Server Clusters","volume":"64","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6598671/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14810430","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Power and Performance Guarantee with Fuzzy MIMO Control in Virtualized Server Clusters","sourcePdf":"tc-lama-184-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115557S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6980145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6980145","articleId":"6598671","onlineDate":"13 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6598672,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Amokrane","affiliation":["LIP6/UPMC\u2014University of Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/6383186/6598672/6598672-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Amokrane received the graduation degree with honors from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure dlnformatique (ESI), Algeria, and Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan (ENS Cachan), France, the engineering degree in computer science from ESI in 2010, and the MSc degree in computer science from ENS Cachan, in 2011, respectively.

However, most cloud providers simply offer virtual machines (VMs) without bandwidth and delay guarantees, which may hurt the performance of the deployed services. Recently, some proposals suggested remediating such limitation by offering virtual data centers (VDCs) instead of VMs only. However, they have only considered the case where VDCs are embedded within a single data center. In practice, infrastructure providers should have the ability to provision requested VDCs across their distributed infrastructure to achieve multiple goals including revenue maximization, operational costs reduction, energy efficiency, and green IT, or to simply satisfy geographic location constraints of the VDCs. In this paper, we propose Greenhead, a holistic resource management framework for embedding VDCs across geographically distributed data centers connected through a backbone network. The goal of Greenhead is to maximize the cloud provider's revenue while ensuring that the infrastructure is as environment-friendly as possible. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal, we conducted extensive simulations of four data centers connected through the NSFNet topology. Results show that Greenhead improves requests' acceptance ratio and revenue by up to 40 percent while ensuring high usage of renewable energy and minimal carbon footprint.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/6383186/06598672.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"49","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2013.5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2013.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6383186","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6598672","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Greenhead: Virtual Data Center Embedding across Distributed Infrastructures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data processing","Distributed processing","Network architecture","Virtual systems","Green computing","Distributed databases","Resource management","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","embedded systems","green computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Greenhead","virtual data center embedding","distributed infrastructures","cloud computing","on-demand computing","networking resources","virtual machines","VMs","VDCs","revenue maximization","operational cost reduction","energy efficiency","green IT","geographic location constraints","holistic resource management framework","geographically distributed data centers","backbone network","cloud provider revenue","NSFNet topology","request acceptance ratio","renewable energy","minimal carbon footprint"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Green computing","energy efficiency","cloud computing","virtual data center","distributed infrastructure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6598672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-June  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Greenhead: Virtual Data Center Embedding across Distributed Infrastructures","volume":"1","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6598672/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-June 2013","accessionNumber":"13934237","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Greenhead: Virtual Data Center Embedding across Distributed Infrastructures","sourcePdf":"tcc2013010036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113104S","chronDate":"Jan.-June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"6383186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"6383186","articleId":"6598672","onlineDate":"13 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6598676,"authors":[{"name":"Rikard Laxhammar","affiliation":["Saab AB, J\u00e4rf\u00e4lla, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6822661/6598676/laxha-172-small.gif","p":["Rikard Laxhammar received the Ph.D. degree in computer science at University of Sk\u00f6vde, Sk\u00f6vde, Sweden, in 2014.

Various algorithms based on learning of normal trajectory patterns have been proposed for this problem. Yet, these algorithms typically suffer from one or more limitations: They are not designed for sequential analysis of incomplete trajectories or online learning based on an incrementally updated training set. Moreover, they typically involve tuning of many parameters, including ad-hoc anomaly thresholds, and may therefore suffer from overfitting and poorly-calibrated alarm rates. In this article, we propose and investigate the Sequential Hausdorff Nearest-Neighbor Conformal Anomaly Detector (SHNN-CAD) for online learning and sequential anomaly detection in trajectories. This is a parameter-light algorithm that offers a well-founded approach to the calibration of the anomaly threshold. The discords algorithm, originally proposed by Keogh et al. , is another parameter-light anomaly detection algorithm that has previously been shown to have good classification performance on a wide range of time-series datasets, including trajectory data. We implement and investigate the performance of SHNN-CAD and the discords algorithm on four different labeled trajectory datasets. The results show that SHNN-CAD achieves competitive classification performance with minimum parameter tuning during unsupervised online learning and sequential anomaly detection in trajectories.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2013.172","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/6822661/06598676.pdf","startPage":"1158","endPage":"1173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2013.172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6822661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online Learning and Sequential Anomaly Detection in Trajectories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6598676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6598676/","displayDocTitle":"Online Learning and Sequential Anomaly Detection in Trajectories","volume":"36","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14331994","pubMedId":"26353278","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6598676/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online Learning and Sequential Anomaly Detection in Trajectories","sourcePdf":"tpami-laxhammar-172-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092082S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6822661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6822661","articleId":"6598676","onlineDate":"13 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6598677,"authors":[{"name":"Bumjoon Seo","affiliation":["Emerging Technology Laboratory, Samsung SDS Co., LTD., Seoul, Korea","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6948290/6598677/6598677-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bumjoon Seo is an advisory researcher with the Emerging Technology Laboratory at Samsung SDS, Co., LTD., Seoul, Korea.

Even so, the issue still deserves investigation because of the continued introduction of novel storage devices such as solid-state drives (SSDs), which have different characteristics from traditional hard disks. We propose novel IO workload characterization and classification schemes, aiming at addressing three major issues: (i) deciding right mining algorithms for IO traffic analysis, (ii) determining a feature set to properly characterize IO workloads, and (iii) defining essential IO traffic classes state-of-the-art storage devices can exploit in their internal management. The proposed characterization scheme extracts basic attributes that can effectively represent the characteristics of IO workloads and, based on the attributes, finds representative access patterns in general workloads using various clustering algorithms. The proposed classification scheme finds a small number of representative patterns of a given workload that can be exploited for optimization either in the storage stack of the operating system or inside the storage device.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6598677/","volume":"63","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6598677/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14710051","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"IO Workload Characterization Revisited: A Data-Mining Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IO Workload Characterization Revisited: A Data-Mining Approach","sourcePdf":"tc-yoon-187-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152284S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6948290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6948290","articleId":"6598677","onlineDate":"13 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6598678,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Min Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Radio Communication Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Min","lastName":"Kim","id":"37900601000"},{"name":"Young Geun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Radio Communication Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Young Geun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085377786"},{"name":"Sung Woo Chung","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Radio Communication Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Woo","lastName":"Chung","id":"37404238500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"6598678","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1713},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"43KB","file":"/ielx7/12/6980145/6598678/graphical_abstract/tc-gagraphic-188.jpg","coverImage":""},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System-on-chip","Thermal management","Performance evaluation","Mobile handsets","Program processors","Cooling","Temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power aware computing","smart phones","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CPU frequency","temperature aware DVFS","off the shelf mobile devices","dynamic voltage frequency scaling","dynamic thermal management","Android based mobile devices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic thermal management","power management","dynamic voltage and frequency scaling","smartphone"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6598678","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilizing CPU Frequency and Voltage for Temperature-Aware DVFS in Mobile Devices","doi":"10.1109/TC.2013.188","startPage":"286","endPage":"292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/6980145/06598678.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2013.188","abstract":"Recent mobile devices adopt high-performance processors to support various functions. As a side effect, higher performance inevitably leads to power density increase, eventually resulting in thermal problems. In order to alleviate the thermal problems, off-the-shelf mobile devices rely on dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS)-based dynamic thermal management (DTM) schemes. Unfortunately, in the DVFS-based DTM schemes, an excessive number of DTM operations worsen not only performance but also power efficiency. In this paper, we propose a temperature-aware DVFS scheme for Android-based mobile devices to optimize power or performance depending on the option. We evaluate our scheme in the off-the-shelf mobile device. Our evaluation results show that our scheme saves energy consumption by 12.7%, on average, when we use the power optimizing option. Our scheme also enhances the performance by 6.3%, on average, by using the performance optimizing scheme, still reducing the energy consumption by 6.7%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6598678/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","volume":"64","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14810418","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6598678/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stabilizing CPU Frequency and Voltage for Temperature-Aware DVFS in Mobile Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilizing CPU Frequency and Voltage for Temperature-Aware DVFS in Mobile Devices","sourcePdf":"tc-chung-188-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03371S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","isNumber":"6980145","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"34","articleId":"6598678","onlineDate":"13 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6598994,"authors":[{"name":"Emad Alsusa","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/6605682/6598994/6598994-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Emad Alsusa (M'06\u2013SM'07) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Bath University, Bath, U.K., in 2000.","He then joined the School of Engineering and Electronics, Edinburgh University, Edinburgh, U.K., as a MobileVCE Postdoctoral Research Fellow, working on industrially led projects on link enhancement techniques for future high-data-rate wireless communication systems.

One of the common techniques for mitigating IN is blanking which is applied at the front end of the receiver to zero the incoming signal when it exceeds a certain threshold. Determining the optimal blanking threshold (OBT) is, however, key for achieving the best performance. Most reported work to find the OBT is based on the availability of the long-term characteristics of IN at the receiver. In this paper, we consider orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based power-line communications and propose a method for finding the OBT without requiring any knowledge about the IN. We show that there is a direct relationship between the OBT and the peak-to-average power value of the OFDM symbol and utilize it to identify the OBT. The results reveal that the proposed technique not only eliminates the need to prior knowledge about the characteristics of IN but also achieves a gain between 0.5-2.5 dB depending on the accuracy of the signal peak-to-average estimate. It will also be shown how the performance of the proposed method can be further enhanced by employing some basic signal per processing at the transmitter.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2272766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/6605682/06598994.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2272766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6605682","startPage":"2201","endPage":"2208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Peak-Based Threshold Estimation Method for Mitigating Impulsive Noise in Power-Line Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6598994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Peak-Based Threshold Estimation Method for Mitigating Impulsive Noise in Power-Line Communication Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6598994/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13797023","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6598994/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Peak-Based Threshold Estimation Method for Mitigating Impulsive Noise in Power-Line Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-rabie-2272766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063245S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6605682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6605682","articleId":"6598994","onlineDate":"13 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6598995,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea M.

Furthermore, we discuss EMC aspects and, according to the norms, we derive the limits for the power spectral density of the I-UWB signal. Then, we study the coexistence between existing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) PLC solutions and I-UWB when they (partly) share the spectrum.

The tests on these electrodes were intended to determine the nonlinear characteristics of earthing systems which can be seen from their voltage and current traces and reduction of their impulse resistance values. Two-rod electrodes in the highest soil resistivity profile showed the largest reductions in impulse resistance due to soil ionization compared with other earth electrodes.

We model investments in two stages, differentiating between commitments that must be made now and corrective actions that can be undertaken as new information becomes available. The objective is to minimize expected transmission and generation costs over the time horizon. Nonlinear constraints resulting from Kirchhoff's voltage law are included. We apply the tool to a 240-bus representation of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council and model uncertainty using three scenarios with distinct renewable electricity mandates, emissions policies, and fossil fuel prices. We conclude that the cost of ignoring uncertainty (the cost of using naive deterministic planning methods relative to explicitly modeling uncertainty) is of the same order of magnitude as the cost of first-stage transmission investments. Furthermore, we conclude that heuristic rules for constructing transmission plans based on scenario planning can be as suboptimal as deterministic plans.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Engineering-Economic Approach to Transmission Planning Under Market and Regulatory Uncertainties: WECC Case Study","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2279654","startPage":"307","endPage":"317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2279654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684613","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6684613/06599010.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599010/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","displayDocTitle":"An Engineering-Economic Approach to Transmission Planning Under Market and Regulatory Uncertainties: WECC Case Study","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6599010/","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13973475","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Engineering-Economic Approach to Transmission Planning Under Market and Regulatory Uncertainties: WECC Case Study","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-munoz-2279654-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129165S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6684613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"6684613","articleId":"6599010","onlineDate":"13 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6599011,"authors":[{"name":"Gonzalo Mateos","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engr., University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6670123/6599011/6599011-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gonzalo Mateos (M'12) received his B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica (UdelaR), Montevideo, Uruguay, in 2005 and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA, in 2009 and 2011.","Since 2012, he has been a Postdoctoral Research Associate with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Digital Technology Center, University of Minnesota.

This paper advocates statistical inference methods to robustify power monitoring tasks against the outlier effects owing to faulty readings and malicious attacks, as well as against missing data due to privacy concerns and communication errors. In this context, a novel load cleansing and imputation scheme is developed leveraging the low intrinsic-dimensionality of spatiotemporal load profiles and the sparse nature of \u201cbad data.\u201d A robust estimator based on principal components pursuit (PCP) is adopted, which effects a twofold sparsity-promoting regularization through an \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm of the outliers, and the nuclear norm of the nominal load profiles. Upon recasting the non-separable nuclear norm into a form amenable to decentralized optimization, a distributed (D-) PCP algorithm is developed to carry out the imputation and cleansing tasks using networked devices comprising the so-termed advanced metering infrastructure. If D-PCP converges and a qualification inequality is satisfied, the novel distributed estimator provably attains the performance of its centralized PCP counterpart, which has access to all networkwide data. Computer simulations and tests with real load curve data corroborate the convergence and effectiveness of the novel D-PCP algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Load Curve Data Cleansing and Imputation Via Sparsity and Low Rank","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2013.2259853","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6670123/06599011.pdf","startPage":"2347","endPage":"2355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2013.2259853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670123","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599011/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Load Curve Data Cleansing and Imputation Via Sparsity and Low Rank","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6599011/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13934038","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Load Curve Data Cleansing and Imputation Via Sparsity and Low Rank","sourcePdf":"tsg-giannakis-2259853-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068019S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6670123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6670123","articleId":"6599011","onlineDate":"13 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6599048,"authors":[{"name":"Maik Keller","affiliation":["PMD Technologies, Germany"],"firstName":"Maik","lastName":"Keller","id":"37589324500"},{"name":"Damien Lefloch","affiliation":["University of Siegen, Germany"],"firstName":"Damien","lastName":"Lefloch","id":"37659567900"},{"name":"Martin Lambers","affiliation":["University of Siegen, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Lambers","id":"37400134600"},{"name":"Shahram Izadi","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Egypt"],"firstName":"Shahram","lastName":"Izadi","id":"37550144200"},{"name":"Tim Weyrich","affiliation":["University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Weyrich","id":"37275702100"},{"name":"Andreas Kolb","affiliation":["University of Siegen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Kolb","id":"37394143400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5067-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6185"}],"articleNumber":"6599048","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":173,"citationCountPatent":17,"totalDownloads":4873},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Data models","Three-dimensional displays","Surface reconstruction","Estimation","Iterative closest point algorithm","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","distance measurement","image fusion","image motion analysis","image reconstruction","natural scenes","object detection","object tracking","pose estimation","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time 3D reconstruction","dynamic scene reconstruction","point-based fusion","online 3D reconstruction","consumer depth camera availability","moving sensor","depth measurements","reconstruction quality","online method","real-time performance","active reconstruction","static scene","scene motion handling","real-time dense reconstruction","point-based representation","range sensors","depth sensors","memory efficiency","standard graphics pipeline","camera pose estimation","data association","outlier removal","depth map fusion","denoised model","dynamic object update","dynamic object detection","robust tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D cameras and sensors","3D shape reconstruction","Kinect Fusion","GPU","Real-time"]}],"abstract":"Real-time or online 3D reconstruction has wide applicability and receives further interest due to availability of consumer depth cameras. Typical approaches use a moving sensor to accumulate depth measurements into a single model which is continuously refined. Designing such systems is an intricate balance between reconstruction quality, speed, spatial scale, and scene assumptions. Existing online methods either trade scale to achieve higher quality reconstructions of small objects/scenes. Or handle larger scenes by trading real-time performance and/or quality, or by limiting the bounds of the active reconstruction. Additionally, many systems assume a static scene, and cannot robustly handle scene motion or reconstructions that evolve to reflect scene changes. We address these limitations with a new system for real-time dense reconstruction with equivalent quality to existing online methods, but with support for additional spatial scale and robustness in dynamic scenes. Our system is designed around a simple and flat point-Based representation, which directly works with the input acquired from range/depth sensors, without the overhead of converting between representations. The use of points enables speed and memory efficiency, directly leveraging the standard graphics pipeline for all central operations, i.e., camera pose estimation, data association, outlier removal, fusion of depth maps into a single denoised model, and detection and update of dynamic objects. We conclude with qualitative and quantitative results that highlight robust tracking and high quality reconstructions of a diverse set of scenes at varying scales.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time 3D Reconstruction in Dynamic Scenes Using Point-Based Fusion","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on 3D Vision - 3DV 2013","doi":"10.1109/3DV.2013.9","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on 3D Vision - 3DV 2013","pdfPath":"/iel7/6598368/6599039/06599048.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DV.2013.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599039","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2013-July 1 2013","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time 3D Reconstruction in Dynamic Scenes Using Point-Based Fusion","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599048/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"13769680","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time 3D Reconstruction in Dynamic Scenes Using Point-Based Fusion","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"5067a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093458S","chronDate":"June 29 2013-July 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6598368","isNumber":"6599039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6598368","citationCount":"173","xplore-issue":"6599039","articleId":"6599048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":6599050,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Upon exploiting the correlation between the phase distortions experienced by the consecutively transmitted symbols and/or based on mutually and iteratively utilizing the increasingly improved bit reliability information among the associated multiple symbols in the context of differentially modulated systems using channel code aided iterative receivers, the joint processing on consecutively received multiple symbols improves the system's performance. For example, an increased robustness against rapid channel fluctuation, improved flexibility in the system's performance-complexity compromise as well as a reduced performance loss is achieved in comparison to its coherent detection aided counterpart. In order to stimulate further research on differentially modulated systems and on the associated multiple-symbol signal processing based advanced receiver design, a comprehensive review on their related concepts and fundamental principles is carried out in this treatise, followed by a number of potential challenges encountered in their practical implementations in future high-spectral-efficiency wireless transmissions, such as their applications in high-order differentially modulated systems and in differential interference suppression of spatial-division multiplexing/multiple access scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Second Quarter  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599058/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","volume":"16","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"14282002","publicationDate":"Second Quarter 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599058/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiple-Symbol Joint Signal Processing for Differentially Encoded Single- and Multi-Carrier Communications: Principles, Designs and Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple-Symbol Joint Signal Processing for Differentially Encoded Single- and Multi-Carrier Communications: Principles, Designs and Applications","sourcePdf":"06hanzo218.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.217497S","chronDate":"Second Quarter  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6811383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6811383","articleId":"6599058","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6599059,"authors":[{"name":"Moustafa Youssef","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Alexandria University and E-JUST, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6734841/6599059/6599059-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Moustafa Youssef is an associate professor at Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology and Alexandria University.

Recently, multi-hop secondary networks have gained attention as a promising design to leverage the full potential of cognitive radio networks. One of the main features of routing protocols in multi-hop networks is the routing metric used to select the best route for forwarding packets. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art routing metrics for cognitive radio networks. We start by listing the challenges that have to be addressed in designing a good routing metric for cognitive radio networks. We then provide a taxonomy of the different metrics and a survey of the way they have been used in different routing protocols. Then we present a case study to compare different classes of metrics. After that, we discuss how to combine individual routing metrics to obtain a global one. We end the paper with a discussion of the open issues in the design of future metrics for cognitive radio networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/6734841/06599059.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"109","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2013.082713.00184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2013.082713.00184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6734841","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing Metrics of Cognitive Radio Networks: A Survey","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Routing protocols","Delays","Switches","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","radio networks","routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio network","single-hop network","physical layer","MAC layer","multihop secondary network","forwarding packet routing","routing protocol metrics","taxonomy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","routing metrics","routing metrics fusion"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"First Quarter  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2013","displayDocTitle":"Routing Metrics of Cognitive Radio Networks: A Survey","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6599059/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"First Quarter 2014","accessionNumber":"14080677","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing Metrics of Cognitive Radio Networks: A Survey","sourcePdf":"006youssef184.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144878S","chronDate":"First Quarter  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"6734841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"264","xplore-issue":"6734841","articleId":"6599059","onlineDate":"16 September 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6599063,"authors":[{"name":"Raza Umar","affiliation":["University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/6811383/6599063/6599063-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Raza Umar received his B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore, Pakistan in 2000.

General structure of the test statistic and corresponding threshold are presented to address existing ambiguities in the literature. The derivation of exact distribution of the test statistic, reported in the literature, is revisited and hidden assumptions on the primary user signal model are unveiled.

As bundle adjustment (BA) being significantly improved recently by preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG), it is worth revisiting how fast incremental SfM is. We introduce a novel BA strategy that provides good balance between speed and accuracy. Through algorithm analysis and extensive experiments, we show that incremental SfM requires only O(n) time on many major steps including BA. Our method maintains high accuracy by regularly re-triangulating the feature matches that initially fail to triangulate. We test our algorithm on large photo collections and long video sequences with various settings, and show that our method offers state of the art performance for large-scale reconstructions.

In this paper, we contribute with a robust algorithm for estimating a personalized human body model from just two sequentially captured depth images that is more accurate and runs an order of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art procedure. Then, we employ the estimated body model to track the pose in real-time from a stream of depth images using a tracking algorithm that combines local pose optimization and a stabilizing dataBase look-up. Together, this enables accurate pose tracking that is more accurate than previous approaches. As a further contribution, we evaluate and compare our algorithm to previous work on a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing more than 15 minutes of challenging motions. This dataset comprises calibrated marker-Based motion capture data, depth data, as well as ground truth tracking results and is publicly available for research purposes.","doi":"10.1109/3DV.2013.44","startPage":"279","endPage":"286","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on 3D Vision - 3DV 2013","pdfPath":"/iel7/6598368/6599039/06599087.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on 3D Vision - 3DV 2013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DV.2013.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599039","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personalization and Evaluation of a Real-Time Depth-Based Full Body Tracker","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shape","Vectors","Estimation","Three-dimensional displays","Tracking","Optimization","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image motion analysis","image reconstruction","image sequences","object tracking","optimisation","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time depth-based full body tracker personalization","real-time depth-based full body tracker evaluation","3D human motion reconstruction","sports sciences","human-computer-interaction","movie industry","personalized human body model","pose tracking","local pose optimization","database look-up","marker-based motion capture data","depth data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["depth sensors","human shape estimation","full-body motion tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2013-July 1 2013","displayDocTitle":"Personalization and Evaluation of a Real-Time Depth-Based Full Body Tracker","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599087/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13769678","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personalization and Evaluation of a Real-Time Depth-Based Full Body Tracker","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"5067a279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069374S","chronDate":"June 29 2013-July 1 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6598368","isNumber":"6599039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6598368","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6599039","articleId":"6599087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6599142,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-An Huang","affiliation":["Integrated Service Technology, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun-An Huang","id":"37087152044"},{"name":"Han-Yun Long","affiliation":["Integrated Service Technology, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Han-Yun Long","id":"37087152541"},{"name":"King-Ting Chiang","affiliation":["Integrated Service Technology, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"King-Ting Chiang","id":"37087153669"},{"name":"Li Chuang","affiliation":["Integrated Service Technology, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Li Chuang","id":"37085570262"},{"name":"Kevin Tsui","affiliation":["Integrated Service Technology, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Tsui","id":"37074530800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0480-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1241-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1550"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-1542"}],"articleNumber":"6599142","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599142","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Milling","Reliability","Copper","Electromigration","Substrates","Failure analysis","Physics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grinding","integrated circuit interconnections","integrated circuit packaging","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit testing","polishing","silicon","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sample preparation","3D IC microbumps observation","microjoint failure mode","microbumps failure mode","tilted grinding","ion polishing system","Si"]}],"abstract":"Two new preparation methods of silicon substrates in the observation of micro-joint and micro-bumps failure mode were proposed in this study.

This paper gives a detailed analysis of the problem on the dynamic chip test in NWL scheme, especially for the Refresh Cycle Reduction (RCR) mode test and suggests the design guideline for the chip test.","doi":"10.1109/IPFA.2013.6599242","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th IEEE International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits (IPFA)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th IEEE International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits (IPFA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588698/6599115/06599242.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPFA.2013.6599242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of dynamic retention characteristics of NWL scheme in high density DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of dynamic retention characteristics of NWL scheme in high density DRAM","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599242/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13768464","conferenceDate":"15-19 July 2013","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of dynamic retention characteristics of NWL scheme in high density DRAM","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"RP127149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049534S","chronDate":"15-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588698","isNumber":"6599115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588698","xplore-issue":"6599115","articleId":"6599242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6599250,"authors":[{"name":"Lee Kyenam","affiliation":["MagnaChip Semiconductor Limited, Cheongju, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Lee Kyenam","id":"37074732600"},{"name":"Jang Hyunho","affiliation":["MagnaChip Semiconductor Limited, Cheongju, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jang Hyunho","id":"37074740400"},{"name":"Kim Kihyun","affiliation":["MagnaChip Semiconductor Limited, Cheongju, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kim Kihyun","id":"37074375200"},{"name":"Park Jeonghyeon","affiliation":["MagnaChip Semiconductor Limited, Cheongju, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Park Jeonghyeon","id":"37074535400"},{"name":"Byunghoon Lee","affiliation":["MagnaChip Semiconductor Limited, Cheongju, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Byunghoon Lee","id":"37074812200"},{"name":"Seo Ulkyu","affiliation":["MagnaChip Semiconductor Limited, Cheongju, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seo Ulkyu","id":"37074131700"},{"name":"Kim Byungsub","affiliation":["MagnaChip Semiconductor Limited, Cheongju, Gyeongsangbuk, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kim Byungsub","id":"37074295500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0480-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1241-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1550"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-1542"}],"articleNumber":"6599250","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":480},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599250","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Failure analysis","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["annealing","driver circuits","electron traps","hot carriers","isolation technology","life testing","liquid crystal displays","MOSFET","semiconductor device reliability","semiconductor device testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermal oxide layer","sidewall oxide thickness optimization","MTI processing scheme","offset leakage current","annealing process","channel shorting","nitride liner","electron trapping","chip shrinkage","isolation characteristic","middle trench isolation scheme","LCD display driver IC","hot electron-induced punch through","PMOSFET leakage current","high-temperature operating lifetime test","PLR test","product level reliability test","HTOL test","HEIP","threshold voltage shift","HV PMOSFET"]}],"abstract":"After PLR(product level reliability) HTOL(high temperature operating lifetime) test of HV PMOSFET, Vth (threshold voltage) shift is observed to increase due to PMOSFET leakage current, which is caused by Hot Electron Induced Punch Through(HEIP). Generally, LCD display driver IC requires high voltage of more than 10V and adopts MTI(middle trench isolation) scheme which is deeply trenched to get isolation characteristics on the high voltage according to chip shrinkage. It was found that electron trapping at interface between sidewall oxide and nitride liner in middle trench isolation(MTI) induces channel shorting at the corner of transistor, thereby resulting in the leakage current. In this paper, we propose the optimized sidewall thickness and the effectiveness of additional annealing process which have strong resistance against hot electron induced punch through regarding that offset leakage current is increased after HTOL(high temperature operating lifetime) stressing test for devices prepared with MTI processing scheme and it might be improved by the optimization of sidewall oxide thickness. Therefore, the threshold voltage(Vth) shift is seriously reduced due to the increase of immunity on the hot electron induced punch-through(HEIP) according to the increase of the sidewall thickness and adding annealing process as the thermal oxide layer of high temperature.","doi":"10.1109/IPFA.2013.6599250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPFA.2013.6599250","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th IEEE International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits (IPFA)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 20th IEEE International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits (IPFA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6588698/6599115/06599250.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HV PMOSFET Vth (threshold voltage) shift caused by HEIP after HTOL","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"HV PMOSFET Vth (threshold voltage) shift caused by HEIP after HTOL","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599250/","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13768452","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599250/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HV PMOSFET Vth (threshold voltage) shift caused by HEIP after HTOL","confLoc":"Suzhou, China","sourcePdf":"RP135247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05614S","chronDate":"15-19 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6588698","isNumber":"6599115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6588698","xplore-issue":"6599115","articleId":"6599250","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6599288,"authors":[{"name":"Xinao-Bing Xian","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Changshu Institute of Technology, Changshu, China"],"lastName":"Xinao-Bing Xian","id":"37074271200"},{"name":"Hua-Juan Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Changshu Institute of Technology, 215500, China"],"lastName":"Hua-Juan Wu","id":"37074097100"},{"name":"Ming-Xin Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Changshu Institute of Technology, 215500, China"],"lastName":"Ming-Xin Zhang","id":"37600031600"},{"name":"Jin-Long Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Changshu Institute of Technology, Changshu, China"],"lastName":"Jin-Long Zhang","id":"37074824400"},{"name":"Xv-Sheng Zhan","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Changshu Institute of Technology, Changshu, China"],"lastName":"Xv-Sheng Zhan","id":"37074775500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0417-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0415-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0416-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5695"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5709"}],"articleNumber":"6599288","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Robustness","Phase locked loops","Probes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","pose estimation","transforms","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipose face recognition algorithm","robust SIFT feature method","probe face pose","gallery face","frontal face image","profile face images","gallery images","face feature database","FFD","feature vector extraction","feature vector dot product","PEI database","CMU PIE database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","Multi-pose","SIFT","Face feature database","Robust"]}],"abstract":"The performance of face recognition algorithm significantly degrades when the pose of probe face is different from gallery face, especially when the angular difference between them is larger than 45\u00b0. One of the possible solutions is that not only using frontal face but combining frontal and profile face images as gallery images. According to this idea, this paper proposes a simple, efficient robust SIFT feature method, which generates the face feature database (FFD) with multi-pose face images. The feature vectors are extracted from multiple poses of each person's face by using SIFT algorithm. Then, by computing the dot product of each feature vector with all others, the robust features which constitute the FFD could be identified. Meanwhile, in the proposed scheme, the importance of features is considered by assigning different weights, which improves accuracy. Experimental results on the PEI and the CMU PIE database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2013.6599288","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589051/6599275/06599288.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2013.6599288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599275","startPage":"32","endPage":"37","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel multi-pose face recognition via robust SIFT feature","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel multi-pose face recognition via robust SIFT feature","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599288/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13769364","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6599288/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel multi-pose face recognition via robust SIFT feature","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"10065168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086843S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589051","isNumber":"6599275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589051","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6599275","articleId":"6599288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6599295,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Morimoto","affiliation":["Information science, Osaka Kyoiku University, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Morimoto","id":"37587895800"},{"name":"Kazuma Ikebe","affiliation":["Information science, Osaka Kyoiku University, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuma","lastName":"Ikebe","id":"37074483200"},{"name":"Yoshito Ishida","affiliation":["Information science, Osaka Kyoiku University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshito","lastName":"Ishida","id":"37074490800"},{"name":"Yuji Oshima","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Oshima","id":"37074363700"},{"name":"Motoi Tatsumi","affiliation":["Information science, Osaka Kyoiku University, Japan"],"firstName":"Motoi","lastName":"Tatsumi","id":"37074631600"},{"name":"Hitoshi Tsuji","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hitoshi","lastName":"Tsuji","id":"37074361100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0417-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0415-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0416-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5695"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5709"}],"articleNumber":"6599295","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"abstract":"N-tree discrete wavelet transform, which is an extended version of the dual-tree complex discrete wavelet transform, is proposed.

Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the improved structure conversion algorithm both in objective and subjective aspects.","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2013.6599310","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589051/6599275/06599310.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2013.6599310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599275","startPage":"163","endPage":"167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image compression using wavelet transform with lifting scheme and SPIHT in digital cameras for Bayer CFA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image compression using wavelet transform with lifting scheme and SPIHT in digital cameras for Bayer CFA","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599310/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13769350","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6599310/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image compression using wavelet transform with lifting scheme and SPIHT in digital cameras for Bayer CFA","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"10285210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077315S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589051","isNumber":"6599275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589051","xplore-issue":"6599275","articleId":"6599310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6599320,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Wei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Jiangxi Institute of Education, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China"],"lastName":"Xiao-Wei Liu","id":"37087073226"},{"name":"Jin-Quan Xiong","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Jiangxi Institute of Education, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China"],"lastName":"Jin-Quan Xiong","id":"37087872150"},{"name":"Zhi-Hua Xie","affiliation":["Key Laboratoryof Optic-Electronic and Communication, Jiangxi Science and Technology Normal University, Nanchang, Jiangxi, China"],"lastName":"Zhi-Hua Xie","id":"37087869815"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0417-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0415-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0416-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5695"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5709"}],"articleNumber":"6599320","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599320","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Feature extraction","Face","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","face recognition","feature extraction","image classification","image fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["membership degree fusion","discrete cosine transform","LGBPH based face recognition","frequency feature","nonstatistics features extraction approach","local classifier","global classifier","ORL face database","local Gabor binary pattern histogram feature","DCT","single sample face recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Global feature","Local feature","DCT","LGBPH","Non-statistics feature extraction"]}],"abstract":"For single sample face recognition, the approaches based on statistical learning are always suffering from the generalizability problem because of small samples.

The global and low frequency features are obtained by low frequency coefficients of discrete cosine transform (DCT). The local and high frequency features are extracted by LGBPH. To integrate the global and local features, the final recognition can be achieved by parallel integration of classification results of the global and local features. The membership degree is defined to integrate local classifier and global classifier. The experimental results on ORL face databases show that the global face and local information can be integrated well after membership degree fusion by global and local features, and this improves the performance of single sample face recognition.

This is due to its multiresolution representation of signals and its localized time-frequency property. The Ramanujan sums (RS) were introduced to signal processing recently. The RS are orthogonal in nature and therefore offer excellent energy conservation. The RS operate on integers and hence can obtain a reduced quantization error implementation. In this paper, we combine the wavelet transform with the RS transform in order to create a new representation of signals. We are trying to combine the merits of the both transforms and at the same time overcome their shortcomings. Our proposed transform contains much richer features than the wavelet transform, so it could be useful for such applications as time-frequency analysis, pattern recognition and image analysis.","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2013.6599326","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589051/6599275/06599326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2013.6599326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599275","startPage":"253","endPage":"258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ramanujan sums-wavelet transform for signal analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ramanujan sums-wavelet transform for signal analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599326/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-17 July 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13769347","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6599326/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ramanujan sums-wavelet transform for signal analysis","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"10445146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064895S","chronDate":"14-17 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589051","isNumber":"6599275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589051","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6599275","articleId":"6599326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6599333,"authors":[{"name":"Takeshi Kato","affiliation":["Instrumentation Systems Laboratory, Toyohashi University of Technology, Toyohashi, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Kato","id":"37896780400"},{"name":"Zhong Zhang","affiliation":["Instrumentation Systems Laboratory, Toyohashi University of Technology, Toyohashi, Japan"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279625200"},{"name":"Hiroshi Toda","affiliation":["Instrumentation Systems Laboratory, Toyohashi University of Technology, Toyohashi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Toda","id":"37274926000"},{"name":"Takashi Imamura","affiliation":["Instrumentation Systems Laboratory, Toyohashi University of Technology, Toyohashi, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Imamura","id":"37301771100"},{"name":"Tetsuo Miyake","affiliation":["Instrumentation Systems Laboratory, Toyohashi University of Technology, Toyohashi, Japan"],"firstName":"Tetsuo","lastName":"Miyake","id":"37298044300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0417-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0415-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0416-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5695"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5709"}],"articleNumber":"6599333","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Abstracts","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","image texture","shape recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directional selection principle","directional selection evaluation method","complex discrete wavelet transform","image processing method","CDWT","shape analysis","texture analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex Wavelet Transform","Directional Selection","Hilbert Transform","Image Processing"]}],"abstract":"Previously, Discrete wavelet Transform(DWT) is well known for useful image processing method.

This however narrows the beamwidth of the antenna and so in turn strengthens the effect of sun outages. This work describes what a sun outage is, how its magnitude is dependent on sun activity and satellite-receiver geometry, and how a new, comprehensive calculator was developed to be able to calculate accurately when such a phenomenon occurs for any user-defined satellites and receiver locations, and how much the received signal degrades. Thus, appropriate countermeasures can be taken to keep the communication link working. The emphasis is on geosynchronous satellites, which are mostly used for communication and experience sun outages, by definition of their orbit, twice per year. The results of the calculator were compared to field measurements, and were relatively similar. There are plenty of computational tools available on the internet with which anyone can predict, with varying limitations, when and with what strength a sun outage occurs at a particular ground station. Several of the publicly available calculators make different assumptions, and so cannot predict the true duration of the outage, or miss them completely. This is why the calculator program developed has more possibilities for inputs, such as the solar flux, as now the sun outage duration and noise temperature rise are related to the sun activity.","doi":"10.1109/IconSpace.2013.6599431","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589035/6599417/06599431.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IconSpace.2013.6599431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599417","startPage":"51","endPage":"55","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sun outage calculator for satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sun outage calculator for satellite communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599431/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13768984","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6599431/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sun outage calculator for satellite communications","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"Session2SCT13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052191S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589035","isNumber":"6599417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589035","xplore-issue":"6599417","articleId":"6599431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6599435,"authors":[{"name":"Sawsan Ali Saad","affiliation":["PowerELab Limited, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Sawsan Ali","lastName":"Saad","id":"37074389300"},{"name":"Mahamod Ismail","affiliation":["PowerELab Limited, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Mahamod","lastName":"Ismail","id":"38183398300"},{"name":"Rosdiadee Nordin","affiliation":["Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor, MY"],"firstName":"Rosdiadee","lastName":"Nordin","id":"38569826400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5233-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-431X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4301"}],"articleNumber":"6599435","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":186},"abstract":"Femtocells are viewed as a promising option for the next generation wireless communication networks, to meet the rising expectation by users in terms of data rates and quality of services. Femtocells are small, inexpensive and low power base stations that are generally consumer deployed, and are expected to significantly enhance the coverage and capacity of indoor users. However femtocells are installed in an ad-hoc manner without proper planning by the network operator. This increases the technical challenges for load balancing and efficient utilization of available resources. In this paper we study the effect of load variations among femtocells on the system performance. We focus on a typical urban dense area with a 5\u00d75-cellular grid representation. Our results show that without any load balancing technique, system performance is significantly degraded in terms of the number of blocked calls and the SINR received by the users.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589035/6599417/06599435.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)","doi":"10.1109/IconSpace.2013.6599435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IconSpace.2013.6599435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599417","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance considerations of LTE-A femtocell networks under different load variations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Base stations","Signal to noise ratio","Ultrafast optics","Femtocell networks","Load management","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","Long Term Evolution","next generation networks","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance consideration","LTE-A femtocell network","next generation wireless communication network","base station","load balancing","resource utilization","5\u00d75-cellular grid representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","3GPP-LTE-A","load balancing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance considerations of LTE-A femtocell networks under different load variations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599435/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13768981","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance considerations of LTE-A femtocell networks under different load variations","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"Session2SCT17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05187S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589035","isNumber":"6599417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589035","xplore-issue":"6599417","articleId":"6599435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6599480,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Dh.

However, in self-organized network such ad-hoc cognitive radio networks (AHCRNs), the CR nodes need change their transmission parameters, coordinate with other nodes in the network to achieve certain goals. Accordingly, challenges have been raised in applying the existing spectrum sharing approach to such environment. Instead, game theory has been adopted as an important mathematical tool in analyzing, and modeling the interaction processes in AHCRNs. In this survey, we introduce the concepts of modeling resource allocation (i.e., power and channel) in AHCRNs with game theory. Comparison between cooperative and non-cooperative game theory has been provided. Application of game theory in PHY, MAC and network layers has been outlined. Future directions in modeling cognitive radio with game theoretic approaches have been outlined as well.","doi":"10.1109/IconSpace.2013.6599484","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6589035/6599417/06599484.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IconSpace.2013.6599484","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)","startPage":"296","endPage":"301","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of game theory to underlay ad-hoc cognitive radio networks: An overview","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599484","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Application of game theory to underlay ad-hoc cognitive radio networks: An overview","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599484/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599484/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13768947","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of game theory to underlay ad-hoc cognitive radio networks: An overview","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"Session9G02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073525S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589035","isNumber":"6599417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589035","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6599417","articleId":"6599484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6599487,"authors":[{"name":"Israna Hossain Arka","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Israna Hossain","lastName":"Arka","id":"37074558400"},{"name":"Mahamod Ismail","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Mahamod","lastName":"Ismail","id":"38183398300"},{"name":"Ayman A.

In cognitive radio network, unlicensed users continuously scan a vast range of frequencies to detect `white spaces' or `spectrum holes' that are temporarily and spatially not being used by licensed user, process of which is commonly known as spectrum sensing. In order to implement the cooperative spectrum sensing among Cognitive Radio (CR) users, data fusion schemes are superior to that of decision fusion ones in terms of detection performance but suffer from the drawback of huge traffic overhead when restriction of bandwidth of communication channels and energy consumption of the radio network comes into consideration. In this paper, a combination of data and decision fusion approach is implemented to mutually adventure the advantages of both and a selective weight setting algorithm is proposed by utilizing normal and modified deflection coefficients maximization under Neyman-Pearson criterion in order to obtain a final decision. Also, cluster-based Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) has been proposed in cognitive radio network to improve the energy efficiency. The simulations show promising results as the hybridization process visibly reduces the network traffic overhead while attaining a highly reasonable detection performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599487/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13768990","htmlLink":"/document/6599487/","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Selective weight setting algorithm in cognitive radio network under resource limitation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective weight setting algorithm in cognitive radio network under resource limitation","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"Session9G05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060704S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6589035","isNumber":"6599417","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6589035","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6599417","articleId":"6599487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6599499,"authors":[{"name":"Salman Saadat","affiliation":["Communication & Network Engineering Department, King Khalid University, Abha, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Salman","lastName":"Saadat","id":"37074163500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5233-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-431X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-4301"}],"articleNumber":"6599499","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MPEG 4 Standard","Mathematical model","Cognitive radio","Delays","Propagation losses","Shadow mapping","Radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","quality of service","radiowave propagation","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility model","propagation model","multihop cognitive radio networks","unlicensed users","secondary users","licensed network idle resource utilization","quality of service","primary users","licensed users","MPEG4 video","bandwidth intensive traffic","NS2 simulations","delay variations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobility","Cognitive Radio","NS2","MPEG4"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio networks allow unlicensed (secondary) users to opportunistically utilize the idle resource of a licensed network for communication without affecting the quality of service being offered to the primary or licensed users.

Measurement of weather induced impairments is an essential component for evaluating optimal link budgets of satellite communication links. Study of regional surface characteristics gives necessary information about probable intensity and altitudes of dust storms arising in that area. Furthermore, several mathematical variables including visibility, average dust particles size, permittivity indices, etc. are required for quantifying the weather impairments and acquiring estimates. This paper encompasses development of a physical model for dust storms having several visibility dependent horizontal layers with reference to variations in altitude along with probabilistic dust particle sizes distribution in each layer.

Thus, the network throughput will increase and the fairness between femtocells remains reasonable we also propose a mechanism that can be applied increase the frequency resources assigned to each femtocell. These new frequencies can be used when femtocells require more frequency resources to carry higher traffic loads.

The proposed hybrid algorithm which is a combination of the IVMWBF and BP algorithms, while having a performance exactly similar to that of the BP algorithm, has less complexity compared to that algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6599566/","accessionNumber":"13768029","displayDocTitle":"A new hybrid decoding algorithm for LDPC codes based on the improved variable multi weighted bit-flipping and BP algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new hybrid decoding algorithm for LDPC codes based on the improved variable multi weighted bit-flipping and BP algorithms","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"A4B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055487S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6599568,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmad Kasaeyan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, K.

Nevertheless, the residual power-line noise should be eliminated. Due to the fact that, the central frequency of power-line may alters about \u00b11Hz and the desired signals around the central frequency should not be attenuated, applying the ideal notch filter with a fixed frequency or a band stop filter is not practical. Benefitting from the powerful microcontroller STM32F4 in a new brand of Electrocardiograph instrument \u201cAraz630\u201d, we present a low cost efficient method of powerline noise removal. This method includes an FFT-based algorithm to find the center frequency of power-line and then subtracting the noise estimated by adaptive non-linear algorithm. In our implementation, we achieve between 30 to 35 dB of cancellation of the fundamental power-line noise component and the central frequency is obtained by the resolution of 0.1 Hz.","pdfPath":"/iel7/6587675/6599515/06599622.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599622","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599622","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599622","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Interference","Electrocardiography","Time-frequency analysis","Digital filters","Equations","IIR filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive estimation","adaptive signal detection","bioelectric potentials","electrocardiography","fast Fourier transforms","interference suppression","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","noise","signal denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG power line interference removal","adaptive nonlinear noise estimator","central frequency","microcontroller STM32F4","electrocardiograph instrument","Araz630","FFT-based algorithm","adaptive nonlinear algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive noise estimation","power-line noise","STM32F4","CMSIS DSP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599622/","displayDocTitle":"ECG power line interference removal using combination of FFT and adaptive non-linear noise estimator","accessionNumber":"13767771","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6599622/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG power line interference removal using combination of FFT and adaptive non-linear noise estimator","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"B1Q14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039914S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599622","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6599637,"authors":[{"name":"Yoones Hashemi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Yoones","lastName":"Hashemi","id":"38570314300"},{"name":"Ali Olfat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Olfat","id":"37330455400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5634-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5633-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6599637","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Relays","Filling","Signal to noise ratio","Computational complexity","Cognitive radio","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","frequency division multiple access","greedy algorithms","OFDM modulation","optimisation","radio links","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint power allocation","subcarrier allocation","cooperative cognitive network","uplink OFDMA","sum-capacity maximisation","primary user","secondary user","optimization problem","interference avoidance","greedy algorithm"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers joint power and subcarrier allocation on the uplink OFDMA-based cooperative cognitive networks.

Hence, one of the most important issues should be considered is improving reliability of distribution networks. Installation of switching devices like sectionalizers along the network, positively affects the system reliability, but, of course, it involves utility cost. The main aim of this paper is to determine optimal number and place of sectionalizers in distribution networks. By considering non-linear and non-differentiable nature of problem, using common methods to solve the problem is not possible. In this paper the optimization problem is solved by multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGAII to minimize installation cost of sectionalizers, simultaneously improving reliability indices, i.e. System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), Expected customer interruption cost (ECOST). Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on a 50 feeder distribution network and simulation results are assessed.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599650","pdfPath":"/iel7/6587675/6599515/06599650.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal placement of switching devices in distribution networks using multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGAII","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599650/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Optimal placement of switching devices in distribution networks using multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGAII","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13768084","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6599650/","conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal placement of switching devices in distribution networks using multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGAII","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"B2F6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06933S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6599656,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Mesri","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Laboratory, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Mesri","id":"37074195500"},{"name":"Abdollah Khoei","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Laboratory, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Abdollah","lastName":"Khoei","id":"37276775200"},{"name":"Khayrollah Hadidi","affiliation":["Microelectronics Research Laboratory, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Khayrollah","lastName":"Hadidi","id":"37276767900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5634-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5633-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6599656","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Fuzzy logic","Simulation","Generators","Phase change materials","Engines","Frequency selective surfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit complexity","CMOS logic circuits","function generators","fuzzy control","fuzzy reasoning","multiplying circuits","programmable logic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general-purpose interval Type-2 fuzzy logic controller","fuzzifier block","fully programmable IT2 membership function generator circuit","Type-1 MFG circuit","slope tuning method","Type-reducer block design","Nie-Tan type-reduction method","hardware complexity","modified multiplier version","defuzzifier block","chip area reduces","speed performance","inference block","power consumption","programming method","IT2 FLC","CMOS technology","MFLIPS","fuzzy logic inference per second","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IT2 Fuzzifier","IT2 Inference Engine","IT2 Output Processor","Type-Reducer","Defuzzifier"]}],"abstract":"In this paper design of a general-purpose Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controller (IT2 FLC) is presented. For the fuzzifier block, a new fully programmable IT2 membership function generator (MFG) circuit based on Type-1(T1) MFG is proposed that uses a new method for slope tuning. The proposed slope tuning method, leads to smaller active area and also significantly smaller total die area by reducing the numbers of required pins in comparison with previous methods. Type-reducer block is designed based on the Nie-Tan type-reduction method which reduces hardware complexity. Moreover, a modified version of multiplier is employed in the defuzzifier block which reduces the chip area and enhances the speed performance. Also, a new min circuit is presented to realize the inference block which is perfectly compatible with other blocks. Small area, low power consumption and especially suitable programming method, makes the proposed FLC suitable for general-purpose applications.

The network combines Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy neural networks with the advantages of adaptive wavelet functions. Therefore, it provides an effective nonlinear mapping which can approximate the local as well as the global behaviour of nonlinear complex systems. Furthermore, an optimized constructive learning algorithm is proposed. In this regard, all network parameters including center and variance of membership functions, dilation and translation of wavelets, and weights are assumed to be adjustable which make the network structure quite flexible. In this method, the orthogonal projection pursuit (OPP) algorithm is invoked in the structure learning phase which can generate the fuzzy rules automatically. Then, the parameters of each rule are optimized based on a nonlinear global optimization method, here, the genetic algorithm (GA). To increase the performance of the optimization scheme, a nonlinear local optimization algorithm, the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), is also applied with the initial point from the GA. This hybrid combination produces a more accurate optimal solution which provides better performance with a fewer number of required fuzzy rules. As some advantages of this approach, the proposed network is self-implemented, and there is no need to initialize the parameters or pre-determine the number of fuzzy rules. Finally, a nonlinear case study is provided which shows the efficiency of the proposed identification approach.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599680","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6587675/6599515/06599680.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear system identification based on a novel adaptive fuzzy wavelet neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Neural networks","Nonlinear systems","Optimization","Approximation algorithms","Approximation methods","Adaptive systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","identification","nonlinear systems","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear system identification","optimized adaptive fuzzy wavelet neural network","FWNN","nonlinear systems","Takagi Sugeno Kang fuzzy neural networks","adaptive wavelet functions","nonlinear mapping","nonlinear complex systems","optimized constructive learning algorithm","membership functions","orthogonal projection pursuit algorithm","fuzzy rules","nonlinear global optimization method","genetic algorithm","nonlinear local optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Nonlinear System identification","fuzzy wavelet neural networks","orthogonal projection pursuit","genetic algorithm","Levenberg-Marquardt"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear system identification based on a novel adaptive fuzzy wavelet neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599680/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","accessionNumber":"13767933","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear system identification based on a novel adaptive fuzzy wavelet neural network","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"B3J2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081797S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6599686,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Taking into account that this problem is NP complete, a heuristic method should be developed. All the approaches developed so far take the iteration frequency or the workload as criteria. In this paper, a novel, evolutionary and non-parameterized technique has been proposed which uses the genetic algorithm to place content in CDN's servers. In this technique, objects are placed in servers according to iteration frequency, load and delay generated by the objects. Through a detailed simulation environment, we show that the proposed technique improves significantly the mean response time and hit rate while keeping the CDNs' servers' load at a very low level.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599698","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599515","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6587675/6599515/06599698.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Replication based on objects iteration frequency and load using a genetic algorithm under a content distribution network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599698/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Replication based on objects iteration frequency and load using a genetic algorithm under a content distribution network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599698/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13767724","publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Replication based on objects iteration frequency and load using a genetic algorithm under a content distribution network","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"B3Q07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103857S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6599707,"authors":[{"name":"Meysam R.

It is necessary to use all sensors of the circular array in order to deploy the phase-mode transformation. In this paper, it is shown that when sensors of the array are directional, and also an optimum beamformer is deployed, it is sufficient to use only a sector of the array instead of all the sensors.

In these networks, Secondary users as the rational decision makers aim to maximize their utility, considering the status of primary channels and the contention regions for each channel. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem in which the proposed cost function for secondary users considers the quality, price and handoff cost of the selected channel. This type of pricing scheme not only manages the cost, but also avoids the secondary users from all selecting the same set of channels; hence reduces the congestion in high quality channels. The target channel for handoff is selected according to the spatial contention between secondary users. This target channel has the minimum cost in terms of congestion level, financial cost and switching probability. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in two scenarios. The first scenario ignores the pricing method while the second consider the price of each channel in its decision making process These two proposed scenarios have been compared with a recent scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599515","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6587675/6599515/06599731.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A congestion-game based scheme for handoff management in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599731/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6599731/","displayDocTitle":"A congestion-game based scheme for handoff management in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13767846","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A congestion-game based scheme for handoff management in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"B4D3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057294S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6599737,"authors":[{"name":"Sina Hassanzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Sina","lastName":"Hassanzadeh","id":"38068877600"},{"name":"Milad Zamani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Milad","lastName":"Zamani","id":"37061939400"},{"name":"Khosrow Hajsadeghi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Khosrow","lastName":"Hajsadeghi","id":"37706156900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5634-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5633-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6599737","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Stability analysis","Circuit stability","SRAM cells","CMOS integrated circuits","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","circuit stability","CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit design","SRAM chips","transistor circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["size 90 nm","storage capacity 32 Kbit","subthreshold SRAM","read SNM","write SNM","power saving constraints","SRAM design","stability","SRAM cell","cell structure","SNM improvement","hold SNM value","differential read method","read performance","sense amplifier","transistor mismatch","TSMC CMOS","subthreshold area"]}],"abstract":"The constraints of power saving have compelled SRAM designers to consider sub-threshold area as a viable choice.

This idea allows for bit-interleaving that makes the SRAM more reliable against the soft errors. One of the challenges of a conventional 6 transistor (6T) SRAM cell in sub-threshold region is sizing of its access transistors. Here by separating access transistors of reading and writing, we mitigate this challenge. By using a minimum-size access transistor for reading, probability of unsuccessful read reduces. To have a more successful write operation, we make one of the inverters of the cell that is fighting with the write access transistor, weaker during write operation by floating its supply voltage and ground rails. After write operation, this inverter returns back to normal mode. Simulation results in 90 nm CMOS technology show that our design satisfies 4.5-sigma criterion for reading and writing at supply voltage of 300 mV. Compared to conventional 6T SRAM cell, our design improves read-time and write-time significantly. For example at supply voltage of 500 mV, these improvements are 137 and 83 percents, respectively. Comparing power and energy consumption for single write operation of the proposed 7T SRAM cell at supply voltage of 300mV with conventional 6T SRAM cell at 800mV (i.e. minimum achievable voltage for this SRAM cell) shows improvements of 133.4X and 266.78X, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599738","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6587675/6599515/06599738.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599738","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new sub-threshold 7T SRAM cell design with capability of bit-interleaving in 90 nm CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"A new sub-threshold 7T SRAM cell design with capability of bit-interleaving in 90 nm CMOS","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599738/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13767936","conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new sub-threshold 7T SRAM cell design with capability of bit-interleaving in 90 nm CMOS","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"B4H6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070047S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6599747,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad-Hossein Golbon-Haghighi","affiliation":["Pasargad Higher Education Institute, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad-Hossein","lastName":"Golbon-Haghighi","id":"37074028900"},{"name":"Mojtaba Shirazi","affiliation":["Pasargad Higher Education Institute, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Shirazi","id":"37583571400"},{"name":"Behrad Mahboobi","affiliation":["Pasargad Higher Education Institute, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Behrad","lastName":"Mahboobi","id":"37294165700"},{"name":"Mehrdad Ardebilipour","affiliation":["Pasargad Higher Education Institute, Shiraz, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Ardebilipour","id":"37300821700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5634-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5633-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6599747","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Array signal processing","Interference","Optimization","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","interference suppression","MIMO communication","minimisation","multiuser channels","quadratic programming","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal beamforming","wireless multiuser MIMO relay network","multiple-input-multiple-output network","multiple concurrent source-destination","channel state information","CSI","MIMO relay weights","relay transmit power","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","SINR","power minimization","nonconvex QCQP","quadratically constrained quadratic program","semidefinite programming","SDP relaxation","randomization technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semi-definite programming","MIMO","relay networks","power allocation","beamforming","MIMO-relay"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with optimal beamforming in wireless multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) relay networks that involves multiple concurrent source-destination pairs with imperfect channel state information (CSI) at relays.

In parallel method, the transmitter and receiver beamforming vectors of each user are iteratively updated by maximizing its utility function. However in serial method, at first step, the transmitter beamforming vectors of all users are iteratively updated by maximizing the utility function of each user and then receiver beamforming vectors of users are calculated. By computer simulations, the performances of the proposed beamforming algorithms are evaluated and also compared with the performance of the duality method (DM) based beamforming algorithm.

In this paper, at first we applied the adaptive Minimum Variance (MV) beamforming to the simulated data derived from Field II. In contrast to conventional beamforming (DAS), MV adaptive beamforming can significantly improve the imaging resolution while retaining the contrast of the image. Then we combined MV with Coherence Factor (CF), by which the resolution and contrast of the medical ultrasound images are simultaneously increased. We implemented these beamformers in the MATLAB and survey the authenticity of them, then fulfil the beamformers with the Visual Studio codes. Those had the same results but execution times of Visual Studio codes are about 13 times lower than other. The major parameters which affect on the image quality are number of elements, height of elements, and sampling frequency. We investigated the effect of these parameters on the image quality by some simulated examples. The results illustrated that the reduction of the number of elements from M=96 to 24 and sampling frequency from 100MHz to 20MHz will degrade quality of the images. Nevertheless, the results of MV beamformer with M=24 and Fs=20MHz are comparable to DAS with M=96 and Fs=100MHz. We illustrated that if height of elements is equal or greater than 5mm, the off-plane targets have a negligible effect on the image quality but if the height of elements is in the same order of the width the off-plane targets have a significant role on the image quality. It should be taken into consideration in using of planar probs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599758/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13768001","publicationDate":"May 2013","conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599758/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of the effects of transducer Parameters on adaptive MV beamformers in medical ultrasound applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of the effects of transducer Parameters on adaptive MV beamformers in medical ultrasound applications","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"C1E5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049779S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6599759,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Torbati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Nima","lastName":"Torbati","id":"37074255900"},{"name":"Ahmad Ayatollahi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ahmad","lastName":"Ayatollahi","id":"37298618900"},{"name":"Ali Kermani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Kermani","id":"38556066900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5634-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5633-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6599759","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Neurons","Vectors","Ultrasonic imaging","Biomedical imaging","Noise","Finite impulse response filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","discrete wavelet transforms","gynaecology","image segmentation","medical image processing","self-organising feature maps","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasound image segmentation","FIR neural network","US","heavy speckle noise","blurry boundaries","neural network based method","self organizing map network","finite impulse response SOM","two dimensional discrete wavelet transform","DWT","FIR-SOM","breast ultrasound images","BUS","tumor region","physician"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network (ANN)","ultrasound image (US) segmentation","computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599759","abstract":"Ultrasound (US) image segmentation is a difficult task because of its heavy speckle noise, low quality and blurry boundaries.

optimization based approaches for hybrid power filter design","abstract":"This paper introduces an optimal hybrid power filter design method to compensate simultaneously current harmonics and reactive power of a nonlinear load. The hybrid power filter consists of a passive RL low-pass filter placed in series with the load and an active filter which has RL elements connected in series with insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) based voltage source converter. The filter is supposed to inject a current into the connection node of the load and grid in order to eliminate current harmonics and its imaginary current. The voltage source converter is placed in a hysteresis feedback control loop to generate the reference current. The band width and output amplitude of the hysteresis controller are optimized with inductance of RL filters. In solving the optimization problem, three objective functions are considered which include minimizing current total harmonic distortion (THD), maximizing power factor and minimizing the IGBT bridge current. The two optimization methods applied are non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm2 (SPEA2) methods. The results of the two optimization methods are compared and it is shown that the SPEA2 method gives the best performance in terms of minimizing current THD, maximizing the power factor and reducing IGBT bridge current.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599762/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13768074","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599762/","publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization based approaches for hybrid power filter design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization based approaches for hybrid power filter design","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"C1F4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080418S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6599766,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Mohammadi","affiliation":["Faculty of ECE, K.

By the presented implementation approach some digital filters are eliminated, saving power at the digital part of the ADC. Implementing the reduced-sample rate structure on 2-2-0 MASH delta-sigma ADC with the OSR of 8, causes the 8-bit pipeline quantizer to work two times lower than the overall frequency at the expense of 1.5dB losses in SNR, and this is rewarding in high bandwidth applications. System level simulation using MATLAB/SIMULINK verifies the usefulness of the presented structure and 70dB SNR is achieved after the first decimation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Modulation","Digital filters","Multi-stage noise shaping","Signal to noise ratio","Delays","Periodic structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","delta-sigma modulation","digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced-sample-rate 2-2-0 MASH-delta-sigma-pipeline ADC architecture","reduced-sample-rate structure","higher order modulator","digital filter","system level simulation","MATLAB","SIMULINK","word length 8 bit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599766","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6587675/6599515/06599766.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A reduced-sample-rate 2\u20132\u20130 MASH-delta-sigma-pipeline ADC architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A reduced-sample-rate 2\u20132\u20130 MASH-delta-sigma-pipeline ADC architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599766/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599766/","accessionNumber":"13767852","conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A reduced-sample-rate 2\u20132\u20130 MASH-delta-sigma-pipeline ADC architecture","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"C1H1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053511S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6599768,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Zaare","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Zaare","id":"38276285200"},{"name":"Mohammad Maymandi-Nejad","affiliation":["Integrated Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Maymandi-Nejad","id":"38271387700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5634-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5633-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6599768","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency shift keying","Electrocardiography","Radio transmitters","Clocks","Capacitors","Approximation methods","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","analogue-digital conversion","CMOS integrated circuits","compressed sensing","electrocardiography","frequency shift keying","medical signal detection","medical signal processing","signal restoration","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power efficient wireless nonuniform adaptive-sampling ECG recording system","successive approximation analog to digital converter","SA-ADC","wireless transmission","sparse signal sampling","nonuniform adaptive sampling method","sample power-efficient transmission","sampling rate change","signal change rate","modified FSK","OOK transmitter","sending extra time flag elimination","synchronization requirement","receiver signal restoration","data volume reduction","important signal information loss","CMOS technology","power saving","compression ratio","ECG signal conventional sampling technique","size 0.18 mum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599768","abstract":"This paper presents a new successive approximation analog to digital converter (SA-ADC) with wireless transmission which samples sparse signals in a non-uniform adaptive way and transmits the samples power-efficiently.

Generally the circuit design in this band is not a challenge; however this is not the case in some circuits, especially in the case of power amplifier design. One of the most important parameters in power amplifier design for civil applications is the product cost. On the other hand power amplifier is the most expensive part of a transceiver or other high power RF system. Consequently low cost high performance power amplifier is very attractive in HF band. In most of designs, high power RF transistor is the most expensive circuit component. This paper presents a new design approach for Class-E power amplifier in HF band, by which the capability of RF switch is considerably improved. Thanks to the proposed approach, we have successfully designed a 30 MHz Class-E power amplifier, using the extra low cost, commercially off-the shelf (COTS) VMOS components. The reported works with COTS VMOS devices are in the range of few hundreds of kilohertz. The cost for the device used in our work is about 100 times lower than the conventional Gemini MOSFET devices. The designed PA exploits 98% power efficiency and 81% power added efficiency with 70 watts output power.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Switches","Inductors","Capacitance","Equations","Mathematical model","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOS integrated circuits","network synthesis","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power added efficiency","Gemini MOSFET devices","COTS VMOS devices","VMOS components","RF switch","high power RF transistor","high power RF system","transceiver","circuit design","HF band applications","class E power amplifier design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class-E","Power amplifier","HF Band","Even Harmonic","Parallel Circuit"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599780","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6587675/6599515/06599780.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of low cost Class-E power amplifier for HF band applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of low cost Class-E power amplifier for HF band applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599780/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599780/","accessionNumber":"13767917","conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of low cost Class-E power amplifier for HF band applications","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"C1P19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048684S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6599782,"authors":[{"name":"Mahdi Barati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Barati","id":"37703703600"},{"name":"Babak Mazhab Jafari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Babak Mazhab","lastName":"Jafari","id":"37086464995"},{"name":"Mohammad Yavari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Yavari","id":"37269863600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5634-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5633-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6599782","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Impedance matching","Linearity","Transistors","Noise measurement","Receivers","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["baluns","linearisation techniques","low noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linearization technique","CMOS low noise amplifiers","differential low noise amplifiers","common mode current","differential output LNA","even order intermodulations","LNA linearity","balun circuitry operation","third input intercept point","constant voltage gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LNA","inter-modulation","IM2","IM3","IIP2","IIP3","transconductance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599782","abstract":"In this paper, a new linearization technique for differential low noise amplifiers (LNAs) is introduced. It removes the common-mode current at all frequencies. One of its main advantages is that it allows the receiver to have a single-ended input and a differential output LNA which attenuates even-order inter-modulations. Also, this technique improves the LNA linearity in three ways. Firstly, it removes the common-mode current of all inter-modulations. Secondly, it attenuates even-order inter-modulations because of its balun circuitry operation. Finally, it improves the third input intercept point (IIP3) due to the possibility of different bias currents for input transistors. Simulation results using a 0.18\u03bcm RF-CMOS technology with HSPICE-RF show that the IIP3 improves about 13 dBm at the expense of increasing the noise figure about 0.7 dB in constant voltage gain and equal DC-power respected to the conventional differential LNA.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599782","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6587675/6599515/06599782.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new linearization technique for CMOS low noise amplifiers with balun circuitry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"A new linearization technique for CMOS low noise amplifiers with balun circuitry","conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599782/","accessionNumber":"13767873","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599782/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new linearization technique for CMOS low noise amplifiers with balun circuitry","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"C1P22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041611S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6599788,"authors":[{"name":"Khabat Soltanian","affiliation":["Department of Software Engineering, University of Kurdistan, Sanandaj, Iran"],"firstName":"Khabat","lastName":"Soltanian","id":"37074437900"},{"name":"Fardin Akhlaghian Tab","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Kurdistan, Sanandaj, Iran"],"firstName":"Fardin Akhlaghian","lastName":"Tab","id":"37394678900"},{"name":"Fardin Ahmadi Zar","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Kurdistan, Sanandaj, Iran"],"firstName":"Fardin Ahmadi","lastName":"Zar","id":"37074551600"},{"name":"Ioannis Tsoulos","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Tsoulos","id":"37297089700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5634-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5633-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6599788","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599788","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Computer architecture","Grammar","Algorithm design and analysis","Biological cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","evolutionary computation","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network generation","grammatical evolution","backpropagation algorithm","classification benchmark"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["artificial neural networks","evolutionary computing","grammatical evolution","classification problems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599788","pdfPath":"/iel7/6587675/6599515/06599788.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural networks generation using grammatical evolution","abstract":"In this paper an automatic artificial neural network generation method is described and evaluated.

The robust design problem is systematized as an optimization procedure and the coordination is concentrated on simultaneous tuning of adjustable gains and time constants of controllers.

Spectrum sensing plays an important role in a CR in order to detect spectrum opportunities. It is usually more desirable to perform spectrum sensing without additional hardware. In this paper, a comparison between performance of filter bank-based (FB-based) and fast Fourier transform-based (DFT-based) energy detectors (EDs) is presented. These methods are used in FBMC and OFDM PHYs with a slight modification to the hardware, respectively. For this comparison the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve namely AUC is considered as a criterion. Moreover, the performance comparison is conducted under the condition that secondary users (SUs) continue their transmission even in the sensing period. As a result, the SU which is performing primary user (PU) detection receives the interference from SUs. This is called nonquiet sensing. The results indicate that although DFT-based ED is less complex, FB-based ED's performance is much better than DFT-based ED in heavy interference environment.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599805","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6587675/6599515/06599805.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599515","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of nonquiet spectrum sensing in filter bank multicarrier and OFDM based cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599805","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of nonquiet spectrum sensing in filter bank multicarrier and OFDM based cognitive radio systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599805/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13767951","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6599805/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of nonquiet spectrum sensing in filter bank multicarrier and OFDM based cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"C2A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052253S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6599807,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Eslami","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Sistan and Baluchestan, Zahedan, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Eslami","id":"37073986600"},{"name":"Hengameh Keshavarz","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Sistan and Baluchestan, Zahedan, Iran"],"firstName":"Hengameh","lastName":"Keshavarz","id":"37391724700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5634-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5633-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6599807","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599807","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Receivers","Transmitters","Fading","Noise","Nickel","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","least mean squares methods","multiuser channels","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","active user optimal number","multiuser channels","rate constrained multiuser channel","independent Rayleigh fading channel","channel state information","empirical algorithms","minimum mean square error","MMSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Number of active users","channel estimation","scaling laws","multi-user channels","fading channels","minimum-rate constraint","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"It has already been shown that in rate-constrained multi-user channels, under the assumption of independent Rayleigh fading channels for different terminals, the number of active users (i.e. the user capacity) scales with double logarithmically with the total number of users.

Due to this fact that the gain channel is time variant, CSI can be estimated by empirical algorithms of the channel estimation like Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE). Considering the errors stemmed from the channel estimation, this paper intends to assess the role of the channel estimator in the analysis of the number of the active users.","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6587675/6599515/06599807.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599807","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of channel estimation on the optimal number of active users in multi-user channels with Rayleigh fading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599807/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"Effects of channel estimation on the optimal number of active users in multi-user channels with Rayleigh fading","htmlLink":"/document/6599807/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13767801","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of channel estimation on the optimal number of active users in multi-user channels with Rayleigh fading","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"C2A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060624S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6599809,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Salar Kaleji","affiliation":["Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Isfahan, IR"],"firstName":"Mehdi Salar","lastName":"Kaleji","id":"37074469900"},{"name":"Mohammad Zoofaghari","affiliation":["Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Isfahan, IR"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Zoofaghari","id":"37074229700"},{"name":"Reza Safian","affiliation":["Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Isfahan, IR"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Safian","id":"37284251800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5634-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5633-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6599809","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599809","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverse problems","Shape","Dielectrics","Polarization","Equations","Sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave polarisation","radiofrequency imaging","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shape reconstruction polarization effect","two-dimensional penetrable objects","two-dimensional nonpenetrable objects","linear sampling method","LSM","object shape reconstruction","far field operator","far field radiation","line source","shape reconstruction quality","imaging quality","two-dimensional targets","transverse magnetic polarization","transverse electric polarization","TE polarization","TM polarization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear Sampling Method","Inverse Scattering","Polarization","Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)"]}],"abstract":"Linear sampling method (LSM) is a simple and effective method for reconstruction of unknown objects shape.

The intrinsic attributes of this environmentally-friendly energy, i.e., the stochastic nature of wind farms generation, however, imposes various technical and financial challenges into power systems. So, developing an accurate wind farm modeling approach aimed at taking into account the wind generation intermittency can relieve many of these challenges. Therefore, this paper takes a step to an efficient wind farm modeling procedure employing an accurate as well as well-known Neural Network (NN)-based tool. The proposed approach is comprised of two main steps. The wind speed is predicted in the first step by the time-series NN method. It then continues in the second step with extracting the predicted wind farm outputs and representing the wind farms generation via a multistate model. To this end, an efficient clustering method, i.e., the Fuzzy c-means Clustering Method (FCM) is employed to find the optimal states. Having applied the proposed approach on the case studies, it will confirm that the proposed analytical multistate model can efficiently consider the wind farms output uncertainties in various studies like the conventional units with less computational burden.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599826","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599515","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6587675/6599515/06599826.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network-based model for wind farm output in probabilistic studies of power systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599826/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural network-based model for wind farm output in probabilistic studies of power systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6599826/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13767947","publicationDate":"May 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network-based model for wind farm output in probabilistic studies of power systems","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"C2G5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075479S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6599829,"authors":[{"name":"Atefeh Salimi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Atefeh","lastName":"Salimi","id":"38241351000"},{"name":"Rasoul Dehghani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Rasoul","lastName":"Dehghani","id":"37283401700"},{"name":"Abdolreza Nabavi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Abdolreza","lastName":"Nabavi","id":"37265082400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5634-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5633-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7054"}],"articleNumber":"6599829","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":553},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6599829","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Bandwidth","Modulation","Switches","Impedance","Noise","Switching frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","electric impedance","integrated circuit noise","modulators","power amplifiers","radiofrequency amplifiers","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband envelope modulator","envelope tracking RF power amplifiers","polar modulation RF power amplifier","PAPR signals linearity","hybrid switching envelope modulator","class AB power amplifier","low output impedance","switching noise ripples","wideband supply modulator","CMOS technology","modulator bandwidth","class AB architecture","HSEM architecture","switching frequency noise","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","envelope modulator","power amplifier","current sense","hysteresis comparator"]}],"abstract":"Polar modulation RF power amplifier is a good candidate to enhance the efficiency while maintaining the linearity for high PAPR signals.

Since the amplitude of this signal is very low, a high-gain low-noise amplifier with a high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) is needed. In portable applications a battery provides the required power for the ECG device. Hence, ECG amplifiers should have low area and power consumption. In this paper, an instrumentation amplifier for ECG application is proposed in which MOSCAPs are used to reduce the circuit area. MOSCAPs are inherently nonlinear and a technique is presented to reduce the impact of this non-linearity. In ECG systems, a driven right-leg circuit is used to increase the CMRR of the amplifier. In this paper a class AB buffer is employed to implement this circuit. The simulation results show that the gain of the proposed amplifier is 46.18 dB and its input referred noise is 7.8\u03bcV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rms</sub>\n over the frequency range of 0.3 Hz to 150 Hz.

Extensive experimental results on different benchmarks show that the hybrid algorithm, performs equal to or better than standard GSA, and backpropagation algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599894","pdfPath":"/iel7/6587675/6599515/06599894.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Iranian Conference on Electrical Engineering (ICEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6599515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid Gravitational search algorithm \u2014 Genetic algorithm for neural network training","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6599894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid Gravitational search algorithm \u2014 Genetic algorithm for neural network training","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13767815","publicationDate":"May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6599894/","conferenceDate":"14-16 May 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid Gravitational search algorithm \u2014 Genetic algorithm for neural network training","confLoc":"Mashhad, Iran","sourcePdf":"C4D2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051301S","chronDate":"14-16 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6587675","isNumber":"6599515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6587675","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6599515","articleId":"6599894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-29"},{"_id":6599927,"authors":[{"name":"P.
