Three different metrics are analysed. The first incorporates binary hard-decision, the second uses the Gaussian matched metric while the third is adapted to the instantaneous frequency statistics at the discriminator output. The analysis shows that unmatched soft decision metric may result in performance degradation as compared to hard decision while the matched metric improves performance as expected For the case of modulation index h=0.5 and normalized IF bandwidth BT=l with convolutional codes of constraint length 3 and rate 1/2 the improvement in performance at error rate of 10/sup 4/ achieved by the matched metric is 3dB as compared to the Gaussian (unmatched) metric and IdB with respect to a hard- decision decoding. It is demonstrated that unmatched soft decision may result in a significant degradation even with respect to the relatively robust scheme incorporating hard decision. The theoretical results are supported by simulation.","doi":"10.1109/EEIS.1989.720028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEIS.1989.720028","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"The Sixteenth Conference of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel,","pdfPath":"/iel4/5787/15446/00720028.pdf","publicationTitle":"The Sixteenth Conference of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel,","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15446","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00720028.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Coded Cpfsk by Sampling Discriminator Followed by a Viterbi-Decoder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Mar 1989","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Coded Cpfsk by Sampling Discriminator Followed by a Viterbi-Decoder","conferenceDate":"7-9 March 1989","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720028/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Coded Cpfsk by Sampling Discriminator Followed by a Viterbi-Decoder","confLoc":"Tel-Aviv, Israel","sourcePdf":"00720028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029415S","chronDate":"7-9 Mar 1989","isNumber":"15446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5787","articleId":"720028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":720039,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The solution scheme is arrived at by exploiting the structural properties of the OPF problem formulation, including the physical characteristics of its variables. The algorithm incorporates certain features of the generalized reduced gradient and the penalty function methods. At each iteration a modified reduced gradient is used to provide a direction of movement. The use of penalty functions in the optimization is kept at a minimum. The generalized reduced gradient ideas are adapted in such a way that a routine power flow is used in the optimization. Numerical results of test cases including a 1410 bus system are given.","doi":"10.1109/PICA.1979.720054","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00720054.png","startPage":"126","endPage":"136","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Conference Proceedings Power Industry Computer Applications Conference, 1979.

The observation of various structural features in the Fourier transform domain allows us to extract important information on the laser cavity. As one example, the amount of cavity propagation loss/gain, or net gain, can be derived from the decay rate of harmonics of the Fourier spectrum. A comparison between experimental and calculated gain versus wavelength data for lasers fabricated in the AlGaAs, AlGaInP, and AlGaInN material systems is given. As a second example, this method also allows the identification of the density and strength of intracavity scattering centers.

High-current insulated gate bipolar transistors are used to directly manipulate the flashlamp current in a microsecond time scale.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.720242","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/3/15546/00720242.pdf","startPage":"2020","endPage":"2028","doi":"10.1109/3.720242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback-stabilized Nd:YLF amplifier system for generation of picosecond pulse trains of an exactly rectangular envelope","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Feedback-stabilized Nd:YLF amplifier system for generation of picosecond pulse trains of an exactly rectangular envelope","volume":"34","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6050452","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720242/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback-stabilized Nd:YLF amplifier system for generation of picosecond pulse trains of an exactly rectangular envelope","sourcePdf":"00720242.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035304S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"19","articleId":"720242","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":720244,"authors":[{"name":"V.A.

The method is based on vectorial formulation of electrodynamics: distributions and propagation of electromagnetic fields in optical circuits are described by equivalent surface sources. This approach permits a division of complex optical waveguide structures into sets of primitive blocks and to separately calculate the transfer amplitude for each block. The transfer amplitude of the entire optical system is represented by a convolution of transfer amplitudes of its primitive blocks. Diffraction in slab regions is taken into account using known propagation functions. It is shown that the concept of a normalized transverse eigenfunction of the diffracted field is very useful in calculations of transfer amplitudes. The crucial role of transverse Bloch modes in propagation through multiwaveguide structures is emphasized. With this method, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of an arbitrary waveguide structure can be obtained with high accuracy. The general approach is illustrated with the transfer amplitude and efficiency calculations for a star coupler and a waveguide grating router.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical propagation","Optical waveguides","Electromagnetic waveguides","Electromagnetic propagation","Circuits","Optical diffraction","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Integrated optics","Electrodynamics","Electromagnetic fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical waveguide theory","integrated optics","electromagnetic field theory","electrodynamics","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","light diffraction","optical couplers","diffraction gratings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical waveguide structures","eigenmode propagation","transfer amplitudes","simulation","integrated optical circuits","vectorial formulation","electrodynamics","electromagnetic fields","optical circuits","equivalent surface sources","primitive blocks","slab regions","diffraction","propagation functions","normalized transverse eigenfunction","transverse Bloch modes","multiwaveguide structures","star coupler","waveguide grating router"]}],"doi":"10.1109/3.720244","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/3/15546/00720244.pdf","startPage":"2036","endPage":"2047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.720244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation of eigenmodes and transfer amplitudes in optical waveguide structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=720244","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Propagation of eigenmodes and transfer amplitudes in optical waveguide structures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720244/","volume":"34","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6050454","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation of eigenmodes and transfer amplitudes in optical waveguide structures","sourcePdf":"00720244.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038673S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"2","articleId":"720244","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":720245,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The capacity of DS-CDMA systems is interference-limited and can therefore be increased by techniques that suppress interference. In this paper, we present developments in interference suppression using blind adaptive receivers that do not receive knowledge of the signal waveforms and propagation channels of the interference, and that require a minimal amount of information about the desired signal. The framework considered generalizes naturally to include additional capabilities such as receive antenna diversity. The most powerful application of the methods described here is for linearly modulated CDMA systems with short spreading waveforms (i.e., spreading waveforms with period equal to the symbol interval), for which they provide substantial performance gains over conventional reception. Implications for future system design due to the restriction of short spreading waveforms and directions for further investigation are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/5.720252","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel4/5/15548/00720252.pdf","startPage":"2049","endPage":"2069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.720252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind adaptive interference suppression for direct-sequence CDMA","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Blind adaptive interference suppression for direct-sequence CDMA","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6045825","volume":"86","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind adaptive interference suppression for direct-sequence CDMA","sourcePdf":"00720252.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122956S","chronDate":"Oct.  1998","isNumber":"15548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"206","articleId":"720252","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":720253,"authors":[{"name":"M.

MPEG-2 was chosen as the video compression standard, and trellis-coded 8-vestigial sideband (VSB) with a training sequence was chosen as the transmission standard. The laboratory tests that were performed on the final two competing systems, 8-VSB with training sequence and 32-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) with blind equalization, showed a need for blind equalization in dynamic channels that could not be adequately handled by an equalizer training on the training sequence alone. Hence, the final GA system recommended the use of blind equalization in the receiver. In this paper, we describe the U.S. digital television transmission standard as it pertains to the equalization problem, typical transmission channel characteristics and the need for blind equalization in terrestrial television receivers.","doi":"10.1109/5.720253","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel4/5/15548/00720253.pdf","startPage":"2070","endPage":"2081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.720253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind decision feedback equalization for terrestrial television receivers","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720253/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Blind decision feedback equalization for terrestrial television receivers","volume":"86","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6045826","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind decision feedback equalization for terrestrial television receivers","sourcePdf":"00720253.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047617S","chronDate":"Oct.  1998","isNumber":"15548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"81","articleId":"720253","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":720265,"authors":[{"name":"C.R.

Very high conversion efficiency (more than 0 dB) and signal-to-background-noise ratio (SBR) (16 dB), for large down- or up-wavelength shifts (30 mn) has been achieved using parallel polarized pumps with low optical power (-13 dBm). Orthogonal polarized pumps result in worse performance, having the advantage of polarization insensitivity for small wavelength spacing between them. The converter operates in a fixed input-tunable output or a tunable input-fixed output mode of operation.

The gratings were printed photochemically, achieving index differences as high as 10/sup -3/ and reflectivities as large as 33 dB. The 3-dB bandwidth is about 0.2 nm. Apodization was used to reduce sidelobes in the reflection spectrum.

As a demonstration, we reduce the optical bandwidth to only 0.1 nm for the 2.5-Gb/s incoherent channel transmission. Even though the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is poor during the transmission, sufficient SNR can be obtained through the intrachannel four-wave mixing at the receiver.

Pan and Liu [1996] recently proposed a novel algorithm, named SeqMapII, of technology mapping with retiming for clock period minimization. Their algorithm, however, requires O(K/sup 3/n/sup 5/log(Kn/sup 2/)logn) run time and O(K/sup 2/n/sup 2/) space for sequential circuits with n gates. In practice, these requirements are too high for targeting K-lookup-table-based FPGA's implementing medium or large designs. In this paper, we present three strategies to improve the performance of the SeqMapII algorithm significantly. Our algorithm works in O(K/sup 2/nln|P/sub v/|logn) run time and O(K|P/sub v/|) space, where n/sub l/ is the number of labeling iterations and |P/sub v/| is the size of the partial flow network. In practice, both n/sub l/ and |P/sub v/| are less than n. Area minimization is also considered in our algorithm based on efficient low-cost K-cut computation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient algorithm for performance-optimal FPGA technology mapping with retiming","doi":"10.1109/43.720312","startPage":"738","endPage":"748","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.720312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/15558/00720312.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=720312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720312/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"An efficient algorithm for performance-optimal FPGA technology mapping with retiming","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6041723","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient algorithm for performance-optimal FPGA technology mapping with retiming","sourcePdf":"00720312.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050579S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"9","articleId":"720312","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":720317,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The basic procedure of Maple-opt is viewed as top-down hierarchical bipartition of a layout region. In each bipartitioning step, technology mapping onto logic blocks of FPGAs, their placement, and global routing are determined simultaneously, which leads to a more congestion-balanced layout for routing. In addition, Maple-opt is capable of estimating a lower bound of the delay for a constrained path and of extracting critical paths based on the difference between the lower bounds and given constraint values in each bipartitioning step. Two delay-reduction procedures for the critical paths are applied; routing delay reduction and logic-block delay reduction. The routing delay reduction is done by assigning each constrained path to a single subregion when bipartitioning a region. The logic-block delay reduction is done by mapping each constrained path onto a smaller number of logic blocks. Experimental results for benchmark circuits demonstrate that Maple-opt reduces the maximum number of tracks per channel by a maximum of 38% compared with existing algorithms while satisfying almost all the path delay constraints.","doi":"10.1109/43.720317","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/15558/00720317.pdf","startPage":"803","endPage":"818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.720317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maple-opt: a performance-oriented simultaneous technology mapping, placement, and global routing algorithm for FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Maple-opt: a performance-oriented simultaneous technology mapping, placement, and global routing algorithm for FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6041728","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maple-opt: a performance-oriented simultaneous technology mapping, placement, and global routing algorithm for FPGAs","sourcePdf":"00720317.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051631S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"8","articleId":"720317","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":720325,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

Hysteresis controllers are intrinsically robust to system parameters, exhibit very high dynamics, and are suitable for simple implementation. The main drawback of the hysteresis controller is a limited control on transistors' switching frequency. Very high switching frequency may result if three independent controllers are used. Multivariable solutions were proposed in the literature to solve the problem. In this paper, it is shown how the use of a sequential design for the multivariable controller can further contribute to transistors' switching frequency reduction, with no significant increase in the hardware implementation complexity. The proposed controller is illustrated and compared with other hysteresis controllers presented in the literature. It ensures a significant reduction of transistors' switching frequency with respect to the other tested controllers, under the same operating conditions. A prototype controller is also presented. The effects of noise captured by current sensors (especially Hall-effect type) on the performance of industrial hysteresis controllers are discussed. It is shown how the sequential design of the controller can also help in solving this critical problem. Experimental results are reported to confirm the quality of the proposed controller. The system stability condition is derived in an appendix.","doi":"10.1109/41.720334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/41/15544/00720334.pdf","startPage":"771","endPage":"781","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.720334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential design of hysteresis current controller for three-phase inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=720334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720334/","displayDocTitle":"Sequential design of hysteresis current controller for three-phase inverter","volume":"45","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6048789","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential design of hysteresis current controller for three-phase inverter","sourcePdf":"00720334.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028976S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"72","articleId":"720334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":720335,"authors":[{"name":"Ying-Yu Tzou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ying-Yu Tzou","id":"37087075631"},{"name":"Shiu-Yung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shiu-Yung Lin","id":"37087515854"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"720335","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":423},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=720335","abstract":"This paper proposes a new discrete fuzzy-tuning current-vector control (FTC) scheme for three-phase pulsewidth modulation (PWM) inverters.

In particular, it is shown that the optimal asymptotic mean squared errors of the estimates of /spl Omega//sup k-1/(t) have orders O(N/sup -(2k+1)/) and O(N/sup -/2(m-k+1)/2m+3), k=1.2,...,m, respectively, for a polynomial /spl Omega/(t) of the degree m-1 and arbitrary smooth /spl Omega/(t) with a bounded mth derivative.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete-time local polynomial approximation of the instantaneous frequency","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.720366","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/15547/00720366.pdf","startPage":"2626","endPage":"2637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.720366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15547","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=720366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720366/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Discrete-time local polynomial approximation of the instantaneous frequency","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6052054","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete-time local polynomial approximation of the instantaneous frequency","sourcePdf":"00720366.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062227S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"43","articleId":"720366","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":720367,"authors":[{"name":"G.

These rules are similar in form in that they both consist of data and penalty terms. Their data terms are identical, but the penalties are different, MDL being more stringent toward overparameterization. AIC penalizes for each additional model parameter with an equal incremental amount of penalty, regardless of the parameter's role in the model, In most of the literature on model selection, MDL appears in a form that also suggests equal penalty for every unknown parameter. This MDL criterion, we refer to as naive MDL. In this paper, we show that identical penalization for every parameter is not appropriate and that the penalty has to depend on the model structure and type of model parameters. The approach to showing this is Bayesian, and it relies on large sample theory. We derive maximum a posteriori (MAP) rules for several different families of competing models and obtain forms that are similar to AIC and naive MDL. For some families, however, we find that the derived penalties are different. In those cases, our extensive simulations show that the MAP rule outperforms AIC and naive MDL.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic MAP criteria for model selection","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.720374","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/15547/00720374.pdf","startPage":"2726","endPage":"2735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.720374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15547","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=720374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720374/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic MAP criteria for model selection","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6052059","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic MAP criteria for model selection","sourcePdf":"00720374.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05272S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"106","articleId":"720374","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":720379,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Chia Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsin-Chia Fu","id":"37087295893"},{"name":"Yeong Yuh Xu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yeong Yuh Xu","id":"37087572069"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"720379","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Character recognition","Bayesian methods","Image databases","Neural networks","Spatial databases","Image recognition","Prototypes","Feature extraction","Microcomputers","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwriting recognition","feature extraction","neural nets","Bayes methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","optical character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian decision-based neural network","multilinguistic handwritten character recognition","self-growing probabilistic decision-based neural network","hierarchical network structure","nonlinear basis functions","competitive credit-assignment scheme","Chinese","alphanumeric character recognition","high recognition accuracy","CCL/HCCR1 public database","CEDAR public database","NCTU/NNL in-house database","low rejection/acceptance rates","image preprocessing","feature extraction","Pentium-100 based personal computer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=720379","abstract":"In this paper, we present a Bayesian decision-based neural network (BDNN) for multilinguistic handwritten character recognition.

From two-port measurements, low-order, frequency-independent lumped circuits are used to model the physical behavior over a broad-frequency range.

The design of a common-source amplifier illustrates the application of the proposed model.","doi":"10.1109/4.720397","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/15559/00720397.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.720397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15559","startPage":"1510","endPage":"1519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An MOS transistor model for analog circuit design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=720397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An MOS transistor model for analog circuit design","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720397/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"33","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6050267","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An MOS transistor model for analog circuit design","sourcePdf":"00720397.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032648S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"208","articleId":"720397","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":720398,"authors":[{"name":"Zhihao Lao","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany"],"lastName":"Zhihao Lao","id":"37087420917"},{"name":"A.

These lamps are being considered for use in a pulsed DC mode of operation in the next generation of rapid thermal processing applications. The results of a series of experiments have shown that the breakdown to arc transition consists of a prethermionic electrode emission phase and a prethermal ionization phase. The large dynamic voltage and current range between the breakdown phase and the arc phase necessitates the use of three different power circuit topologies. A high-voltage ignition circuit is connected in series with an arc-sustaining power source. The series connection ensures that the arc-sustaining power supply is isolated from the high-voltage ignition circuit. The arc-sustaining current source power source consists of a step-down hysteresis-current-controlled DC/DC converter cascaded with a constant off-time output-voltage-controlled step-up DC/DC converter. The current-controlled converter supplies the minimum arc-sustaining current, whereas the step-up converter provides the minimum post-ignition prethermal ionization voltage. The inclusion of a shorting switch allows one to reduce the current ratings of the high-voltage circuit components. Finally, experimental verification of a simplified circuit model of the ignition to arc transition, the circuit operation, a power supply design procedure, and a design example are provided.","doi":"10.1109/28.720441","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.720441","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1025","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/28/15542/00720441.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power supply design considerations for maintaining a minimum sustaining current in a vortex water wall high-pressure argon arc lamp","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Power supply design considerations for maintaining a minimum sustaining current in a vortex water wall high-pressure argon arc lamp","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"34","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6050493","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720441/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power supply design considerations for maintaining a minimum sustaining current in a vortex water wall high-pressure argon arc lamp","sourcePdf":"00720441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040926S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1998","isNumber":"15542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"7","articleId":"720441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":720446,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

An algorithm which employs the conventional space-vector PWM method in the low modulation range, and the GDPWM method in the high modulation range, is established. As a result, the current waveform quality, switching losses, voltage linearity range, and the overmodulation region performance of a PWM voltage-source inverter (PWM-VSI) drive are optimized online, as opposed to conventional modulators with fixed characteristics. Due to its compactness, simplicity and superior performance, the algorithm is suitable for most high-performance PWM-VSI drive applications. This paper provides detailed performance analysis of the method and compares it to the other methods. The experimental results verify the superiority of this algorithm to the conventional PWM methods.","doi":"10.1109/28.720446","startPage":"1059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/28/15542/00720446.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.720446","endPage":"1071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high-performance generalized discontinuous PWM algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720446/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"A high-performance generalized discontinuous PWM algorithm","volume":"34","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6050498","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-performance generalized discontinuous PWM algorithm","sourcePdf":"00720446.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031163S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1998","isNumber":"15542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"361","articleId":"720446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":720450,"authors":[{"name":"M.W.

The technique relies upon the generation of point defects via plasma induced damage during the deposition of sputtered SiO/sub 2/, and provides a simple and reliable process for the fabrication of both wavelength tuned lasers and monolithically integrated devices. Wavelength tuned broad area oxide stripe lasers are demonstrated in InGaAs-InAlGaAs, InGaAs-InGaAsP, and GaInP-AlGaInP quantum well systems, and it is shown that low absorption losses are obtained after intermixing. Oxide stripe lasers with integrated slab waveguides have also enabled the production of a narrow single lobed far field (3/spl deg/) pattern in both InGaAs-InAlGaAs, and GaInP-AlGaInP devices. Extended cavity ridge waveguide lasers operating at 1.5 /spl mu/m are demonstrated with low loss (/spl alpha/=4.1 cm/sup -1/) waveguides, and it is shown that this loss is limited only by free carrier absorption in waveguide cladding layers. In addition, the operation of intermixed multimode interference couplers is demonstrated, where four GaAs-AlGaAs laser amplifiers are monolithically integrated to produce high output powers of 180 mW in a single fundamental mode. The results illustrate that the technique can routinely be used to fabricate low-loss optical interconnects and offers a very promising route toward photonic integration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6056203","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Monolithic integration via a universal damage enhanced quantum-well intermixing technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monolithic integration via a universal damage enhanced quantum-well intermixing technique","sourcePdf":"00720474.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118053S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1998","isNumber":"15550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"81","articleId":"720474","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":720491,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In the first, termed as the combination problem, a weighted sum of the l/sub 1/ norms and the square of the /spl Hscr//sub 2/ norms of a given set of input-output transfer functions constituting the closed loop is minimized. It is shown that, in the one-block case, the solution can be obtained via a finite-dimensional quadratic optimization problem which has an a priori known dimension. In the four-block case, a method of computing approximate solutions within any a priori given tolerance is provided. In the second, termed as the mixed problem, the /spl Hscr//sub 2/ performance of the closed loop is minimized subject to an l/sub 1/ constraint.

The approach is based on a highly efficient simultaneous perturbation approximation to the gradient based on loss function measurements. SPSA is based on picking a simultaneous perturbation (random) vector in a Monte Carlo fashion as part of generating the approximation to the gradient. This paper derives the optimal distribution for the Monte Carlo process. The objective is to minimize the mean square error of the estimate. The authors also consider maximization of the likelihood that the estimate be confined within a bounded symmetric region of the true parameter. The optimal distribution for the components of the simultaneous perturbation vector is found to be a symmetric Bernoulli in both cases.

Unlike the subject of information-theoretic communication theory, information-theoretic imaging is far from a mature subject. The possible role of information theory in problems of image formation is to provide a rigorous framework for defining the imaging problem, for defining measures of optimality used to form estimates of images, for addressing issues associated with the development of algorithms based on these optimality criteria, and for quantifying the quality of the approximations. The definition of the imaging problem consists of an appropriate model for the data and an appropriate model for the reproduction space, which is the space within which image estimates take values. Each problem statement has an associated optimality criterion that measures the overall quality of an estimate. The optimality criteria include maximizing the likelihood function and minimizing mean squared error for stochastic problems, and minimizing squared error and discrimination for deterministic problems. The development of algorithms is closely tied to the definition of the imaging problem and the associated optimality criterion. Algorithms with a strong information-theoretic motivation are obtained by the method of expectation maximization. Related alternating minimization algorithms are discussed. In quantifying the quality of approximations, global and local measures are discussed. Global measures include the (mean) squared error and discrimination between an estimate and the truth, and probability of error for recognition or hypothesis testing problems. Local measures include Fisher information.","doi":"10.1109/18.720533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.720533","startPage":"2094","endPage":"2123","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/15554/00720533.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information-theoretic image formation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Information-theoretic image formation","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"44","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6072631","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720533/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information-theoretic image formation","sourcePdf":"00720533.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084171S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"67","articleId":"720533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":720534,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The story goes back of course to Shannon's R(D) theory in the case of Gaussian stationary processes, which says that transforming into a Fourier basis followed by block coding gives an optimal lossy compression technique; practical developments like transform-based image compression have been inspired by this result. In this paper we also discuss connections perhaps less familiar to the information theory community, growing out of the field of harmonic analysis. Recent harmonic analysis constructions, such as wavelet transforms and Gabor transforms, are essentially optimal transforms for transform coding in certain settings. Some of these transforms are under consideration for future compression standards. We discuss some of the lessons of harmonic analysis in this century. Typically, the problems and achievements of this field have involved goals that were not obviously related to practical data compression, and have used a language not immediately accessible to outsiders. Nevertheless, through an extensive generalization of what Shannon called the \"sampling theorem\", harmonic analysis has succeeded in developing new forms of functional representation which turn out to have significant data compression interpretations. We explain why harmonic analysis has interacted with data compression, and we describe some interesting recent ideas in the field that may affect data compression in the future.","doi":"10.1109/18.720544","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/15554/00720544.pdf","startPage":"2435","endPage":"2476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.720544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data compression and harmonic analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=720544","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Data compression and harmonic analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720544/","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6072642","volume":"44","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data compression and harmonic analysis","sourcePdf":"00720544.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021786S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"244","articleId":"720544","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":720545,"authors":[{"name":"P.

It is mainly concerned with a class of subjects that involve the central notion of the distance distribution of a code. Special emphasis is put on the linear programming method, inspired by the MacWilliams transform. This produces upper bounds for the size of a code with a given minimum distance, and lower bounds for the size of a design with a given strength. The most specific results are obtained in the case where the underlying association scheme satisfies certain well-defined \"polynomial properties;\" this leads one into the realm of orthogonal polynomial theory. In particular, some \"universal bounds\" are derived for codes and designs in polynomial type association schemes. Throughout the paper, the main concepts, methods, and results are illustrated by two examples that are of major significance in classical coding theory, namely, the Hamming scheme and the Johnson scheme. Other topics that receive special attention are spherical codes and designs, and additive codes in translation schemes, including Z/sub 4/-additive binary codes.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.720545","doi":"10.1109/18.720545","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/15554/00720545.pdf","startPage":"2477","endPage":"2504","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Association schemes and coding theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Association schemes and coding theory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6072643","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Association schemes and coding theory","sourcePdf":"00720545.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019258S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"102","articleId":"720545","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":720546,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The coding theorem asserts that there are block codes with code rates arbitrarily close to channel capacity and probabilities of error arbitrarily close to zero. Fifty years later, codes for the Gaussian channel have been discovered that come close to these fundamental limits. There is now a substantial algebraic theory of error-correcting codes with as many connections to mathematics as to engineering practice, and the last 20 years have seen the construction of algebraic-geometry codes that can be encoded and decoded in polynomial time, and that beat the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. Given the size of coding theory as a subject, this review is of necessity a personal perspective, and the focus is reliable communication, and not source coding or cryptography. The emphasis is on connecting coding theories for Hamming and Euclidean space and on future challenges, specifically in data networking, wireless communication, and quantum information theory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720549/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","volume":"44","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"6072647","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The art of signaling: fifty years of coding theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The art of signaling: fifty years of coding theory","sourcePdf":"00720549.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019187S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15554","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"34","articleId":"720549","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":720550,"authors":[{"name":"I.

For the first 25 years of its existence, rate-distortion theory had relatively little impact on the methods and systems actually used to compress real sources. Today, however, rate-distortion theoretic concepts are an important component of many lossy compression techniques and standards.

The GA uses variable-length chromosome coding and two knowledge-based operators namely, add object and delete object. The proposed algorithm correctly detects the number of objects in the given images and the estimation of the object's parameters, namely, the location, size and shape is fairly accurate.","doi":"10.1109/97.720556","startPage":"248","endPage":"251","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/97/15555/00720556.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/97.720556","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tomographic reconstruction of circular and elliptical objects using genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tomography","Genetic algorithms","Maximum likelihood estimation","Image reconstruction","Object detection","Signal to noise ratio","Background noise","Maximum likelihood detection","Shape","Biological cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","image reconstruction","genetic algorithms","encoding","maximum likelihood estimation","object detection","knowledge based systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intensities","circular object","elliptical object","genetic algorithm","model-based tomographic reconstruction","uniform background","variable-length chromosome coding","knowledge-based operators","add object","delete object","parameter estimation","location","size","shape","approximate maximum-likelihood estimate","object detection","iterative technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720556/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Tomographic reconstruction of circular and elliptical objects using genetic algorithm","volume":"5","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6063314","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tomographic reconstruction of circular and elliptical objects using genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"00720556.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074679S","chronDate":"Oct.  1998","isNumber":"15555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"7","articleId":"720556","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":720560,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Ping Zhang","affiliation":["Division of Engineering, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Xiao-Ping Zhang","id":"37279339900"},{"name":"M.D. Desai","affiliation":["Division of Engineering, University of Texas, San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Desai","id":"37358042100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"720560","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":146,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":973},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Discrete wavelet transforms","Wavelet coefficients","Wavelet domain","Adaptive algorithm","Mean square error methods","Optimization methods","Gaussian noise","White noise","Minimax techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","functional analysis","wavelet transforms","noise","least mean squares methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal solution","SURE risk","Stein's unbiased risk estimate","thresholding functions","continuous derivative","soft-thresholding function","adaptive algorithm","wavelet shrinkage method","adaptive denoising method","mean square error","MSE performance"]}],"abstract":"A new adaptive denoising method is presented based on Stein's (1981) unbiased risk estimate (SURE) and on a new class of thresholding functions.

We consider the two scenarios where FEC is introduced as a transparent layer underneath a reliable multicast layer that uses ARQ, and where FEC and ARQ are both integrated into a single layer that uses the retransmission of parity data to recover from the loss of original data packets. To evaluate the performance improvements due to FEC, we consider different loss rates and different types of loss behavior (spatially or temporally correlated loss, homogeneous or heterogeneous loss) for up to 10/sup 6/ receivers. Our results show that introducing FEC as a transparent layer below ARQ can improve multicast transmission efficiency and scalability.

In this paper we consider the transmission of stored video from a server to a client across a network, and explore how the client buffer space can be used most effectively toward reducing the variability of the transmitted bit rate. Two basic results are presented. First, we show how to achieve the greatest possible reduction in rate variability when sending stored video to a client with given buffer size. We formally establish the optimality of our approach and illustrate its performance over a set of long MPEG-1 encoded video traces. Second, we evaluate the impact of optimal smoothing on the network resources needed for video transport, under two network service models: deterministic guaranteed service (Chang 1994; Wrege et al. 1996) and renegotiated constant-bit-rate (RCBR) service (Grossglauser et al. 1997). Under both models, the impact of optimal smoothing is dramatic.","doi":"10.1109/90.720873","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/15572/00720873.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.720873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supporting stored video: reducing rate variability and end-to-end resource requirements through optimal smoothing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720873/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","displayDocTitle":"Supporting stored video: reducing rate variability and end-to-end resource requirements through optimal smoothing","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","accessionNumber":"6015391","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supporting stored video: reducing rate variability and end-to-end resource requirements through optimal smoothing","sourcePdf":"00720873.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060655S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"265","articleId":"720873","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":720921,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We model the cyclic evolution of TCP, each cycle starting at the epoch at which recovery starts from the losses in the previous cycle. TCP throughput is computed as the reward rate in a certain Markov renewal-reward process. Our model allows us to study the performance implications of various protocol features, such as fast retransmit and fast recovery. We show the impact of coarse timeouts. In the local network environment the key issue is to avoid a coarse timeout after a loss occurs. We show the effect of reducing the number of duplicate acknowledgements (ACKs) for triggering a fast retransmit. A large coarse timeout granularity seriously affects the performance of TCP, and the various protocol versions differ in their ability to avoid a coarse timeout when random loss occurs; we quantify these differences. We show that, for large packet-loss probabilities, TCP-Reno performs no better, or worse, than TCP-Tahoe. TCP-NewReno is a considerable improvement over TCP-Tahoe, and reducing the fast-retransmit threshold from three to one yields a large gain in throughput; this is similar to one of the modifications in the TCP-Vegas proposal. We explain some of these observations in terms of the variation of fast-recovery probabilities with packet-loss probability. The results of our analysis compare well with a simulation that uses actual TCP code.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6015398","displayDocTitle":"Comparative performance analysis of versions of TCP in a local network with a lossy link","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative performance analysis of versions of TCP in a local network with a lossy link","sourcePdf":"00720921.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031106S","chronDate":"Aug 1998","isNumber":"15572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"201","articleId":"720921","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":720925,"authors":[{"name":"T.H.

Commercial MATLAB-based software packages implementing a crude approximation to the theory are available [3, 4], but these computer packages address the complex /spl mu/-synthesis problem via a somewhat flawed implementation of the original D-K iteration algorithm which involves the repetition of the following three operations on a suitable augmented closed-loop system transfer function: 1. Optimize a diagonal scaling frequency response matrix D(jw) for a fixed control law K(s). 2. Perform an ad hoc state space curve-fit to D(jw). 3. Use H/sup /spl infin// control to compute a control law K(s) with the diagonal scaling D(s) fixed. The curve-fitting of Step 2 has, until now, been a major obstacle to the realization of the original vision of a completely automated /spl mu/-synthesis procedure for robust control design. This paper describes new theoretical results and how they enable one to bypas the difficult and awkward curve-fitting of Step 2. The result is the first reliable computational algorithm for /spl mu/-synthesis controller design. The technique has been implemented on MATLAB. An example involving real /spl mu/-synthesis for the ACC Benchmark problem is included.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/720997/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"/spl mu/-Synthesis Robust Control: What's wrong and how to fix it?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"/spl mu/-Synthesis Robust Control: What's wrong and how to fix it?","confLoc":"Westlake Village, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00720997.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049681S","chronDate":"25-27 May 1993","isNumber":"15034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5618","citationCount":"19","articleId":"720997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":721048,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Redford","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer, Engineering, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Redford","id":"37087000486"},{"name":"P.

However, attaining the buffer size (buffer depth) in optical packet switches required in practice is a major problem; in this paper, a new solution is presented. An architectural concept is discussed and justified mathematically that relies on cascading many small switches to form a bigger switch with a larger buffer depth. The number of cascaded switches is proportional to the logarithm of the buffer depth, providing an economical and feasible hardware solution. Packet loss performance, control and buffer dimensioning are considered. The optical performance is also modeled, demonstrating the feasibility of buffer depths of several thousand, as required for bursty traffic.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=721059","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical packet switching","Optical switches","Optical buffering","Packet switching","Optical fiber couplers","Electromagnetic interference","Optical fiber devices","Delay lines","Hardware","Optical losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical switches","packet switching","telecommunication traffic","optical delay lines","optical interconnections","optical communication equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SLOB switch","large optical buffers","packet switching","optical packet switch architectures","fiber delay lines","passive couplers","electromagnetic interference","EMI","pinout","interconnection problems","large electronic switch cores","buffer size","buffer depth","optical packet switches","small switches","cascaded switches","acket loss performance","buffer dimensioning","optical performance","buffer depths","bursty traffic"]}],"publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/50/15573/00721059.pdf","startPage":"1725","endPage":"1736","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.721059","doi":"10.1109/50.721059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SLOB: a switch with large optical buffers for packet switching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/721059/","displayDocTitle":"SLOB: a switch with large optical buffers for packet switching","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6057045","volume":"16","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SLOB: a switch with large optical buffers for packet switching","sourcePdf":"00721059.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062266S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"131","articleId":"721059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":721060,"authors":[{"name":"Wen De Zhong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"lastName":"Wen De Zhong","id":"37352076500"},{"name":"R.S.

The bias-dependent intrinsic elements of an HEMT's equivalent circuit are described by a generalized multilayered NN whose inputs are the gate-to-source bias (V/sub gs/) and the drain-to-source bias (V/sub ds/). Using C/sub gs/ data as an example, we began by experimentally examining some of the features of the multilayered NN model to obtain rules-of-thumb on choosing training parameters and other information for succeeding studies. We then developed and studied a novel pruning technique to optimize the C/sub gs/ NN model. Excessively large NN configurations can be reduced to an appropriate size by means of a weight decay, which is based on the analysis of a synaptic connection's activity. Finally, we employed a genetic algorithm for the same purpose. By representing the configuration of a standard multilayered NN as a chromosome, the optimum configuration of a C/sub gs/ model was obtained through a simulated evolution process. For this approach, the configuration of an NN that simultaneously represents seven intrinsic elements (C/sub gs/,R/sub i/,...,C/sub ds/) of an equivalent circuit was also shown for comparison to previous work. We successfully obtained simplified NN models using both approaches. The advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches are discussed in the conclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report to clarify the general process of building an NN device model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/721137/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","volume":"46","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6064929","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Structural determination of multilayered large-signal neural-network HEMT model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structural determination of multilayered large-signal neural-network HEMT model","sourcePdf":"00721137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044883S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"28","articleId":"721137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":721140,"authors":[{"name":"T.B.

In this paper, we describe a neural network-based microwave circuit-design approach that implements the solution-searching optimization routine by a modified neural network learning process. Both the development of a microwave circuit model and the searching of a design solution can thus take advantage of a hardware neural network processor, which is significantly faster than a software simulation. In addition, a systematic simulation-based approach to convert conventional circuit models into neural network models for this design process is described. The development of a heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) amplifier model and its applications are demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/22.721152","startPage":"1492","endPage":"1494","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel4/22/15574/00721152.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.721152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reverse modeling of microwave circuits with bidirectional neural network models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microwave circuits","Neural networks","Circuit simulation","Predictive models","Multi-layer neural network","Neural network hardware","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Application software","Process design","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave circuits","neural nets","circuit CAD","circuit optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reverse modeling","microwave circuits","bidirectional neural network models","circuit-design process","solution-searching optimization routine","modified neural network learning process","HBT amplifier model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/721152/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Reverse modeling of microwave circuits with bidirectional neural network models","volume":"46","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6064944","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reverse modeling of microwave circuits with bidirectional neural network models","sourcePdf":"00721152.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0608S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"42","articleId":"721152","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":721156,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-sze Tong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Ming-sze Tong","id":"37293261200"},{"name":"Yinchao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Yinchao Chen","id":"37311250400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9480"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9670"}],"articleNumber":"721156","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image analysis","Transmission lines","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Time domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Algorithm design and analysis","Power transmission lines","Maxwell equations","Microstrip","Resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission line theory","finite difference time-domain analysis","resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["propagation characteristics","field images","printed transmission lines","anisotropic substrates","2D FDTD method","finite-difference time-domain algorithm","uniform transmission fines","transverse resonant properties","Gibbs phenomenon elimination","time-stepping termination","Blackman-Harris window function"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we apply an efficient two-dimensional (2-D) finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm to an analysis of uniform transmission fines printed on various anisotropic substrates.

Such systems consist of a microwave interferometer, incorporating a high-Q resonator and a phase-sensitive microwave readout. Suppressing the carrier at the output of the interferometer enables the microwave readout to operate in the small-signal regime with an effective noise temperature close to its physical temperature, When used as a sensor of a frequency-control system to lock the oscillator to a selected resonant mode of a high-Q resonator, the interferometric frequency discriminator has enabled more than two orders of magnitude improvement in oscillator phase-noise performance as compared with the state-of-the-art. Thus, the phase noise of an S-band oscillator was reduced to -150 dBc/Hz at 1-kHz Fourier frequency without the use of cryogenics, and was limited by the thermal noise in the microwave interferometer. To facilitate tuning and locking, an automatically balanced microwave frequency discriminator was developed using voltage-controlled attenuators and phase shifters. Rapid frequency tuning of the oscillator was achieved by varying the interferometer phase mismatch and automatically controlling the carrier suppression without tuning the high-Q resonator.","doi":"10.1109/22.721162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel4/22/15575/00721162.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.721162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15575","startPage":"1537","endPage":"1545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of interferometric signal processing to phase-noise reduction in microwave oscillators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=721162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Applications of interferometric signal processing to phase-noise reduction in microwave oscillators","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/721162/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6064953","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of interferometric signal processing to phase-noise reduction in microwave oscillators","sourcePdf":"00721162.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12218S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"71","articleId":"721162","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":721177,"authors":[{"name":"S.P.

The finite element method (FEM) is used to solve the drift-diffusion equation of impurities in silicon. The thermal oxidation using a model based on steady-state oxidant diffusion is dealt with the boundary element method (BEM). Both methods are employed for calculating the complicated geometry and the boundary conditions in the simulation, where these methods are simultaneously used for the oxidizing condition. For the finite element analysis, mass lumping is introduced to get the stable result. The matrix obtained is asymmetric and irregular sparse, the matrix is solved by the Conjugate Gradient-Squared method (CGS) with preconditioning-conditioning (Incomplete LDU factorization). Thus a more economical calculation method is obtained than the conventional FEM and BEM analysis, using Gaussian elimination method.","doi":"10.1109/NASCOD.1987.721183","publicationTitle":"[1987] NASECODE V: Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on the Numerical Analysis of Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits","startPage":"219","endPage":"224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NASCOD.1987.721183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15445","pdfPath":"/iel4/5786/15445/00721183.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"[1987] NASECODE V: Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on the Numerical Analysis of Semiconductor Devices and Integrated Circuits","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oxidation","Boundary conditions","Poisson equations","Semiconductor impurities","Finite element methods","Silicon","Sparse matrices","Semiconductor devices","Steady-state","Boundary element methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Finite and boundary element approach to process simulation with conjugate gradient-based method","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/721183/","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2002","publicationDate":"1987","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 1987","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 1987","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite and boundary element approach to process simulation with conjugate gradient-based method","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"00721183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034208S","chronDate":"17-19 June 1987","isNumber":"15445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5786","articleId":"721183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1987","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":721195,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The power spectral density of the oscillator is composed of a term related to the high-frequency fluctuations in the feedback loop and a term related to the low-frequency fluctuations of the frequency control voltage. The latter is treated stochastically in a similar fashion to the inhomogeneous line broadening of gas lasers due to the Doppler effect. This additional broadening causes a deviation of the power spectral density from the Lorentzian shape, that is, from the phase noise decay of -6 dB per octave. This is specially pronounced at not-too-large frequency offsets. The analogy between electrical oscillators and optical oscillators (lasers) allows the methods used in optical spectroscopy to be applied. The approach may be employed to synthesize oscillator spectra from the equivalent circuit parameters with small numerical effort. Furthermore, it allows experimental power density spectra to be decomposed into the contributions stemming from the high-frequency noise in the feedback loop and the low-frequency noise of the oscillation frequency. This should give better insight into the origin of the phase noise. Besides VCO's, this concept may be useful for oscillators subject to Gaussian supply and substrate noise.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.721256","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/15576/00721256.pdf","startPage":"904","endPage":"908","doi":"10.1109/81.721256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analytical model for the power spectral density of a voltage-controlled oscillator and its analogy to the laser linewidth theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"An analytical model for the power spectral density of a voltage-controlled oscillator and its analogy to the laser linewidth theory","volume":"45","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6060059","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/721256/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analytical model for the power spectral density of a voltage-controlled oscillator and its analogy to the laser linewidth theory","sourcePdf":"00721256.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070535S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"31","articleId":"721256","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":721258,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

Its principal distinction from conventional loop or node analysis is that a simpler reference system model in the absence of N designated \"extra\" elements is solved first, and the N extra elements are then restored via a correction factor. Parameters in the correction factor are various single injection and null double injection driving point immittances seen by the extra elements, and are all calculated upon the reference model. Thus, no calculation is performed upon a model containing any of the designated extra elements, and the final result is obtained by assembly of sequentially obtained results in a \"divide and conquer\" approach that is potentially easier, shorter, and which produces lower entropy forms than does the conventional approach. The NEET correction factor is a simultaneous bilinear representation of the extra elements, which can be immittances or dependent generators in any combination, and thus exposes explicitly the contribution of each extra element. An especially useful implementation of the NEET is to designate all the reactances as extra elements. The frequency response of the transfer function is then contained entirely in the NEET correction factor, which emerges directly as a ratio of polynomials in complex frequency s. The zeros as well as the poles can thus be obtained directly from the driving point resistances seen by the reactances, and it can also be determined whether any of the zeros or poles are exactly factorable. The approach throughout is to show how the NEET theorem can be useful in practical Design-Oriented Analysis, and emphasis is on the criteria by which the designer-analyst can take maximum advantage of the numerous choices of which elements to designate as \"extra\" and which of the many versions of the theorem to adopt.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/721258/","volume":"45","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"6060061","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The N Extra Element Theorem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The N Extra Element Theorem","sourcePdf":"00721258.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05025S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"47","articleId":"721258","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":721262,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We consider an array of coupled oscillators as a graph by associating the oscillators to vertices and the coupling to edges. When the coupled array is synchronized, the phase of the oscillators can be considered as the color associated with the corresponding vertices. We prove that for connected 2-colorable graphs, we can construct a coupled array which generates the 2-coloring for that graph. For the general case, numerical simulation results with connected 3-colorable graphs suggest that the coupled array of oscillators can color graphs with a small number of colors in most cases. Some complexity issues of the system and comparisons to antivoter models of graph coloring are discussed. We also conjecture that the system can be used to approximate the star chromatic number of the graph.","doi":"10.1109/81.721263","startPage":"974","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/15576/00721263.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.721263","endPage":"978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph coloring via synchronization of coupled oscillators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/721263/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Graph coloring via synchronization of coupled oscillators","volume":"45","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6060065","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph coloring via synchronization of coupled oscillators","sourcePdf":"00721263.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033179S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"17","articleId":"721263","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":721265,"authors":[{"name":"F.

We investigate the general subset of multiwavelets with a corresponding polyphase matrix that can be factored as a product of degree-1 factors in one variable. We consider in particular multiwavelets with vanishing moments. The number of vanishing moments that can be achieved increases with the increase in the McMillan degrees of the multiwavelet polyphase matrix. We design multiwavelets with vanishing moments by solving a set of nonlinear constraints on the free parameters defining the multiwavelet polyphase matrix. Design examples are given for the quincunx sampling scheme. We also show that imposing the requirement of linear phase in the case of order-factorable multiwavelets, imposes a simple constraint on each of its polynomial order-1 factors. We thus obtain a simple and complete method of constructing orthogonal order-factorable multiwavelets with linear phase.

One of the main advantages of this procedure is that it establishes a one-to-one relationship between any real signal and the pair of functions defining its instantaneous amplitude and phase. However, there are some problems in its physical interpretation but it is shown that for narrow-band signals the analytical signal is well related to some physical procedures allowing the measurements of amplitude and frequency. As any analytical signal is a very specific function, any arbitrary pair of functions cannot be considered as the amplitude and phase of a real signal. This point is especially discussed in the case of phase signals, which means signals with constant instantaneous amplitude. The phase must satisfy very specific conditions related to the theory of Blaschke functions and analyzed in the regular as well as in the singular cases. These results are applied to hyperbolic and parabolic chirp signals. Hyperbolic signals are true phase signals corresponding to the singular case. On the other hand parabolic signals, often called signals with instantaneous frequency varying linearly in time, are not phase signals and their amplitude is not constant. This point is analyzed in detail and the structure of their amplitude and phase is explicitly calculated. Various calculations allow the evaluation of the errors appearing when assuming that these signals are true phase signals. Some extensions to other cases of chirp signals are discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TFSA.1998.721419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFSA.1998.721419","startPage":"293","endPage":"300","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time-Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis (Cat.

The received signal is first analyzed by the STFT. The localized interferers in the time-frequency (t-f) domain are then removed by binary excisions. Finally, the synthesized signal is correlated with the PN sequence and passed to the detector. The selection of both the data window and the distribution of the binary excision values in the t-f domain are key to effective removal of the jammer with a minimum distortion of the DS/SS communication signal. Proper data windows localize the interference in as few t-f bins as possible, whereas good binary excision assigns zero values to only those t-f bins contaminated by the jammer t-f signature. The closed form expression of the receiver SNR is derived as a function of the binary excision values in the t-f domain.

It is shown that oversampling results in improved numerical stability. We consider the reconstruction from noisy samples and we characterize compactly supported scaling functions having compactly supported synthesis functions. Finally, it is shown that in the oversampled case the synthesis functions are not uniquely determined.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFSA.1998.721468","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time-Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis (Cat.

The general approach and the nonadaptive estimation procedure were first presented by Pitton (1998). The method uses time-frequency concentrated basis functions which generalize the properties of the prolate spheroidal waveforms. Individual spectrograms computed with these eigenfunctions form direct time-frequency spectrum estimates, and are combined to form the multitaper time-frequency spectrum estimate. We then develop a new adaptive procedure which reduces the bias of the individual eigenestimates using an estimate of their leakage characteristics. The revised multitaper estimator then has correspondingly improved bias properties. An expression for the variance of the adaptive estimator is also derived, providing a complete characterization of the statistical time-frequency estimator.","doi":"10.1109/TFSA.1998.721512","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE-SP International Symposium on Time-Frequency and Time-Scale Analysis (Cat.

A novel scheme, called the Hartley modulating functions (HMF) method, is proposed for the detection and estimation of physical parameter jumps given noisy observations. The HMF-method converts the nonlinear differential equation describing the convolvable nonlinear system into a Hartley spectrum equation using the frequency weighted least squares algorithm. During conversion the method retains identical relationship between physical parameter coefficients in differential equations and Hartley spectrum equations. Thus, it is suitable for estimation of physically-based nonlinear continuous-time systems.

The wide variety of renewable energy sources and their highly site-specific and variable nature are coupled with different types of load demand claim for efficient and reliable EFM of IGSs. The forecasting errors of the meteorological data and model calculated must be taken into account to avoid poor performance in calculating required power. Fuzzy sets enable to handle these uncertainties and so making reliable and efficient EFM of IGS. In this paper a fuzzy logic approach has been used to address the EFM problems in IGS. As a case of study a proposed rule based EFM strategy has been implemented to a small sized IGS experimental prototype assembled in the frame of the project of the European Union \"Combined multiple renewable energy source systems simulator\". The results show relevant improvement in energy performance, so as problems that rise by fuzzy logic application in IGS. Comparison with simulation results from an in house developed logistical program embedding conventional EFM are pointed out as the fuzzy EFM reduces fuel consumption and increases the penetration of renewable sources.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1998.721602","startPage":"969","endPage":"974 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (Cat.

Their prevalence in the literature and product lines of the electric utility industry has almost overworked the descriptor \"intelligent\". However, ANNs do not have an IQ. They exhibit attributes that humans often associate with intelligence: an ability to learn, to communicate, to perceive, or to reason. The objective of this tutorial is to give a basic understanding of ANNs and computational intelligence. This is accomplished by discussing the historical and biological basis of ANNs and reviewing two representative architectures from a simple taxonomy for ANNs. In this tutorial, the use of the term architecture is used to imply both a network topology and a learning rule. Resources for further studies and free software are also recommended.","doi":"10.1109/67.721699","startPage":"14","endPage":"16","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","pdfPath":"/iel4/67/15584/00721699.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/67.721699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural networks and computational intelligence","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Computational intelligence","Computer architecture","Power system analysis computing","Power system control","Power systems","Control systems","Load forecasting","Monitoring","Power industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural net architecture","power system analysis computing","power system control","load forecasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","computational intelligence","power systems","load forecasting","monitoring","diagnosis","power system control","supervised learning","electric utility industry","learning ability","biological basis","neural net architectures","network topology","learning rule","power system analysis","unsupervised learning","self-organisation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/721699/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks and computational intelligence","volume":"11","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6065986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural networks and computational intelligence","sourcePdf":"00721699.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028126S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"67","citationCount":"12","articleId":"721699","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":721760,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Protocol boosters are an adaptation technique that allows dynamic and efficient protocol customization to heterogeneous environments. By design, the boosting mechanism is under control of a policy, which determines when augmentation is required. Thus, many portions of a protocol stack execute only as necessary, permitting significant increases in performance relative to general-purpose protocols. Design principles for protocol boosters are presented, as well as an example booster. Two implementation platforms are described: (1) an augmented Linux operating system, which is freely available to other researchers; and (2) a rapidly reprogrammable hardware prototype, called the Programmable Protocol Processing Pipeline (P4), which is based on off-the-shelf FPGA technology. Since protocol boosters are programmed functions and can be network-resident, a programmable network infrastructure is necessary to exploit their full capability. Thus, protocol boosters are an ideal application for an on-the-fly programmable network infrastructure.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protocol boosters: applying programmability to network infrastructures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/35.722140","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/35/15592/00722140.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"83","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.722140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=722140","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722140/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Protocol boosters: applying programmability to network infrastructures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6072838","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protocol boosters: applying programmability to network infrastructures","sourcePdf":"00722140.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043789S","chronDate":"Oct.  1998","isNumber":"15592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"14","articleId":"722140","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":722148,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Fueled by the explosive growth of the Internet, applications and market opportunities are demanding that higher capacity, higher data rates, and advanced multimedia services be supported in the near future. The evolution of the IS-95 CDMA standard to higher data rates and more advanced services occurs in two steps. The first step, IS-95-B, is an enhancement to the IS-95-A standard and offers the highest possible performance without breaking current IS-95-A air interface design characteristics, thereby maintaining strict compatibility with existing base station hardware. The proposed standard will support a high data rate (64 kb/s) in both directions, to and from the mobile device. A new burst mode packet data service is defined to allow better interference management and capacity utilization. The second evolution step, cdma2000, provides next-generation capacity, data rates, and services. The cdma2000 system includes a greatly enhanced air interface supporting CDMA over wider bandwidths for improved capacity and higher data rates while also maintaining backward compatibility with existing IS-95 CDMA end-user devices. The cdma2000 system also includes a sophisticated MAC feature to effectively support very-high-data-rate services (up to 2 Mb/s) and multiple concurrent data and voice services. This article describes the design and performance of the high-data-rate service provided by second- and third-generation CDMA systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolution of wireless data services: IS-95 to cdma2000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/35.722150","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/35/15592/00722150.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.722150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=722150","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722150/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Evolution of wireless data services: IS-95 to cdma2000","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6072846","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolution of wireless data services: IS-95 to cdma2000","sourcePdf":"00722150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039263S","chronDate":"Oct.  1998","isNumber":"15592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"127","articleId":"722150","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":722151,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

The key to realizing this potential is the development and deployment of high-performance radio systems. In this article we describe a basic service concept, advanced cellular Internet service (ACIS), and the technologies for achieving reliable high-speed transmission to wide-area mobile and portable cellular subscribers with very high spectrum efficiency. Such a wireless service, optimized to meet the needs of a client-server model for information retrieval and Web browsing, and combined with evolutionary enhancements in second-generation technologies, can provide an attractive option for third-generation systems. The radio link design combines OFDM with transmit and receive antenna diversity and Reed-Solomon coding to overcome the link budget and dispersive fading limitations of the cellular mobile radio environment. For access, a dynamic packet assignment algorithm is proposed which combines rapid interference measurements, priority ordering, and a staggered frame assignment schedule to provide spectrum efficiencies of two-to-four times existing approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced cellular Internet service (ACIS)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/35.722151","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/35/15592/00722151.pdf","startPage":"150","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.722151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=722151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722151/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Advanced cellular Internet service (ACIS)","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6072847","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced cellular Internet service (ACIS)","sourcePdf":"00722151.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045473S","chronDate":"Oct.  1998","isNumber":"15592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"51","articleId":"722151","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":722176,"authors":[{"name":"H.E.

Cells are differentiated by concatenating the user FH pattern with a shuffling sequences of the same hop rate. The use of guard times enables synchronous operation for the range of hopping rates of interest. The capacities of the above FH/SSMA network with either coherent BPSK modulation or non-coherent BFSK modulation are first evaluated for the AWGN channel. The effect of power control errors on the system performance is accounted for in each case. Then the effects of Rayleigh fading are factored in.

Because of the mobility of the base stations, power balancing among the transmitters at different base stations is more difficult than in commercial cellular CDMA systems. Handoff of mobiles among base stations is also more difficult, primarily due to the mobility and the resulting lack of a high-speed wire-line network to interconnect the base stations. One important consequence is a higher likelihood of strong interference in the mobile receivers due to transmissions from neighboring base stations. In this paper the sensitivity to interference from neighboring base stations is investigated for the forward channels of a mobile cellular CDMA network.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference in mobile cellular CDMA forward traffic channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Military Communications Conference.

This paper addresses a new SS technique, referred to as multi-carrier spread spectrum (MC-SS). An original MC-SS scheme is proposed using polyphase filtering. As for tactical communications, dramatic performance improvements are achieved, especially for partial-band jammers. Moreover, classical problems of synchronization encountered in multi-carrier modulation systems (MCM) are resolved by the proposed waveform. This provides an extremely good safety level. The MC-SS technique consists in a combination of standard DS/SS with a MCM scheme. Such a combination is motivated by the advantages of the MCM, which provides robustness in the case of frequency selective channels, as well as an efficient digital implementation in its well known OFDM form (implemented in DAB, DVB, ...). The paper highlights that this new MC-SS method fits tactical communications constraints. It shows that this new modem proposes an active and reliable method to combat agile jammers. Special attention is paid to synchronization issues. For tactical communications, this leads to a new protection feature.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1998.722209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Military Communications Conference. Proceedings. MILCOM 98 (Cat.

The importance of interleaving and coding is emphasised and their impact on the bit error-rate performance is evaluated. In the first part of the paper, the effect of jamming on a COFDM system is obtained under worst-case conditions. For single tone jamming, the results show that the effect of the jamming signal on the bit error rate is acceptable, even at signal to jamming power ratios as low as -15 dB, when interleaving and convolutional coding is used. For the case where 20% of the transmission spectrum is corrupted by partial-band jamming, it is necessary for the signal to jamming power ratio to be 5 dB or more to achieve an acceptable bit error rate. To provide additional resilience, the case of an OFDM/CDMA scheme is examined where the spread-spectrum process gain is used to provide additional protection against jamming.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Military Communications Conference.

In this paper the performance of amplitude clipped high order OFDM is considered. Using a central limit theorem, the distribution of the OFDM signal is found to be asymptotically Gaussian when the order of the OFDM signal approaches infinity. An expression for the probability that the PAPR of the signal will exceed a given level is found, and using it an upper bound on the BER is derived. It is shown that when the clipping level approaches infinity faster than /spl radic/(ln N), then a zero BER penalty and arbitrarily large peak-to-average power ratio gain are asymptotically obtained. It is also shown that use of the asymptotic results for N/spl ges/32 causes a negligible error in practice.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1998.722213","publicationTitle":"IEEE Military Communications Conference.

Given a task graph, duplication-based scheduling can mitigate this overhead by allocating some of the tasks redundantly on more than one processor. In this paper, we focus on the problem of using duplication in static scheduling of task graphs on parallel and distributed systems. We discuss five previously proposed algorithms and examine their merits and demerits. We describe some of the essential principles for exploiting duplication in a more useful manner and, based on these principles, propose an algorithm which outperforms the previous algorithms. The proposed algorithm generates optimal solutions for a number of task graphs. The algorithm assumes an unbounded number of processors. For scheduling on a bounded number of processors, we propose a second algorithm which controls the degree of duplication according to the number of available processors. The proposed algorithms are analytically and experimentally evaluated and are also compared with the previous algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/71.722221","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/15579/00722221.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.722221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"872","endPage":"892","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On exploiting task duplication in parallel program scheduling","volume":"9","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6066564","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On exploiting task duplication in parallel program scheduling","sourcePdf":"00722221.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045097S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"200","articleId":"722221","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":722250,"authors":[{"name":"B.K.

The components are: (1) chosen from a list of products available in the market; and (2) characterized by their nominal performance level, availability and cost. System availability is represented by a multi-state availability function, which extends the binary-state availability. To satisfy the required multi-state system availability, the redundancy for each component can be used. A procedure which determines the minimal-cost series-parallel system structure subject to a multi-state availability constraint is proposed. A fast procedure is developed, based on a universal generating function, to evaluate the multi-state system availability. Two important types of systems are considered and special operators for the universal generating function determination are introduced. A genetic algorithm is used as an optimization technique.

Presenting this output visually increases assessment productivity by as much as 80 percent. Visualization also improves conversion quality by suggesting more-informed and efficient repair strategies. This visualization tool is based on the idea that no one view is sufficient to answer important questions concerning Y2K. It therefore provides a suite of tightly coupled, linked views. Each view is engineered for a particular task, is interactive, and is used for both display and analysis. Linking between views causes interactive operations to propagate instantly in each view. The authors report that the results to date have been promising. In one case, the time required for assessment and conversion strategy development dropped from three weeks to three days.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722291/","volume":"31","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"6056067","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A visualization tool for Y2K","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A visualization tool for Y2K","sourcePdf":"00722291.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026476S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"3","articleId":"722291","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":722292,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

An NI includes hardware that exposes an internal interface-such as device registers-to a host processor. A key problem with most current NIs is that their internal interface is similar to that of a disk's interface. Because of such limitations, current NIs will not be adequate for use with newer, high-performance networks and host computers. High-performance local area networks have advanced so far that some view them as a new class of networks called system area networks (SANs). Emerging SANs deliver bandwidths of 10 Gbps or more and latencies of tens of nanoseconds-two to four orders of magnitude better than that delivered by most current LANs. New hosts demand much higher performance. If NIs do not adapt to these changes they will become a barrier to improving network performance. To solve this problem, future NIs should appear to their hosts more like memory than disk interfaces. The authors argue that treating NI accesses like memory accesses is justified by the importance of network performance to future computers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722292/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6056068","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"31","issue":"10","displayDocTitle":"Making network interfaces less peripheral","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Making network interfaces less peripheral","sourcePdf":"00722292.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040783S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"17","articleId":"722292","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":722293,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Due to the systems' analytical intractability, simulation is the most common performance evaluation technique for such systems. However, the long execution times needed for sequential simulation models often hampers evaluation. The slow speeds of sequential model execution have led to growing interest in the use of parallel execution for simulating large-scale systems. Widespread use of parallel simulation, however; has been significantly hindered by a lack of tools for integrating parallel model execution into the overall framework of system simulation. Another drawback to widespread use of simulations is the cost of model design and maintenance. The simulation environment the authors developed at UCLA attempts to address some of these issues. It consists of three primary components: a parallel simulation language called Parsec (parallel simulation environment for complex systems), its GUI, called Pave, and the portable runtime system that implements the simulation algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"31","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6056069","displayDocTitle":"Parsec: a parallel simulation environment for complex systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parsec: a parallel simulation environment for complex systems","sourcePdf":"00722293.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050663S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"338","articleId":"722293","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":722295,"authors":[{"name":"W.

A hierarchical subdivision of the surface with associated tight bounding volumes provides for quick identification of the surface regions likely to be hit by a ray. For each leaf of the hierarchy, an approximation to the corresponding surface region is stored. The approximation is used to compute a good starting point for the iteration, which ensures rapid convergence. Trimming curves are described by a tree of trimming primitives, such as squares, circles, polygons, and free-form curves, combined with Boolean operations. For trimmed surfaces, an irregular adaptive subdivision is constructed to quickly eliminate all parts outside the trimming curve from consideration during rendering. Cost heuristics are introduced to optimize the rendering time further.","doi":"10.1109/2945.722295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2945.722295","endPage":"214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel4/2945/15606/00722295.pdf","startPage":"202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ray-tracing triangular trimmed free-form surfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul-Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul-Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722295/","displayDocTitle":"Ray-tracing triangular trimmed free-form surfaces","volume":"4","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"6063810","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Sept. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ray-tracing triangular trimmed free-form surfaces","sourcePdf":"00722295.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058319S","chronDate":"Jul-Sep 1998","isNumber":"15606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"6","articleId":"722295","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":722299,"authors":[{"name":"D.F.

Being able to see some representation of the entire information space provides an initial gestalt overview and gives context to support browsing and search tasks. However, the limited number of pixels on the screen constrain the information bandwidth and make it difficult to completely display large information spaces. The Information Mural is a two-dimensional, reduced representation of an entire information space that fits entirely within a display window or screen. The Mural creates a miniature version of the information space using visual attributes, such as gray-scale shading, intensity, color, and pixel size, along with antialiased compression techniques. Information Murals can be used as stand-alone visualizations or in global navigational views. We have built several prototypes to demonstrate the use of Information Murals in visualization applications; subject matter for these views includes computer software, scientific data, text documents and geographic information.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15606","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel4/2945/15606/00722299.pdf","doi":"10.1109/2945.722299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2945.722299","startPage":"257","endPage":"271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Information Mural: a technique for displaying and navigating large information spaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul-Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul-Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722299/","displayDocTitle":"The Information Mural: a technique for displaying and navigating large information spaces","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"6063814","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July-Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Information Mural: a technique for displaying and navigating large information spaces","sourcePdf":"00722299.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069001S","chronDate":"Jul-Sep 1998","isNumber":"15606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"80","articleId":"722299","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":722342,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Hearst","affiliation":["California Univ., Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Hearst"},{"name":"A.Y.

He then enumerates important issues in the field and demonstrates how the Information Manifold project has addressed some of these. C. Knoblock and S. Minton describe the Ariadne system. Two of its distinguishing features are its use of wrapper algorithms to extract structured information from semistructured data sources and its use of planning algorithms to determine how to integrate information efficiently and effectively across sources. W. Cohen describes an interesting variation on the theme, focusing on \"informal\" information integration. The idea is that, as in related fields that deal with uncertain and incomplete information, an information-integration system should be allowed to take chances and make mistakes. His Whirl system uses information-retrieval algorithms to find approximate matches between different databases, and as a consequence knits together data from quite diverse sources.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722342/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.-Oct.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  1998","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1998","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6064614","volume":"13","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Information integration","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information integration","sourcePdf":"00722342.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039795S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  1998","isNumber":"15615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5254","citationCount":"30","articleId":"722342","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":722349,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohui Liu","affiliation":["Moorfields Eye Hospital"],"lastName":"Xiaohui Liu","id":"37280573800"},{"name":"Gongxian Cheng","affiliation":["University of London, UK"],"lastName":"Gongxian Cheng","id":"37364878400"},{"name":"J.X.

The main feature of our proposed systems is the utilization of two different fields in the analysis of the satellite multiple access problem when the traffic is heavy in order to deliver a greater amount of information bits per time slot. A CDMA m-sequence coding for the SSA has been applied together with a type I hybrid ARQ system. The ARQ system utilized was a selective repeat ARQ system together with BCH code intended to perform error detection and correction. The system performance was evaluated according to different amount of parity check bits of the BCH code on an environment with noise (AWGN) and co-channel interference from other users trying to access the hub. Since the hub now possesses the FEC capability to correct errors that appear after the CDMA despreading of the packets, the satellite doesn't need to ask so often for the retransmission of erroneous packets and will ask for retransmission only when the FEC capability is exceeded. Computer simulations show the performance of the proposed multiple access scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.722473","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

A proof of concept hardware system for a 6 MHz bandwidth transponder is developed for hardware simulation, which uses MSK and OQPSK-type constant envelope direct sequence spread spectrum modulation and handles data rates of 4 to 64 kbps. The receiver is designed with coherent matched filter technique to achieve fast code acquisition, AFC and coherent detection in a single matched filter circuit. This receiver structure facilitates variable data rate on demand during a call without the aid of system control earth stations. The CDMA performance of the prototype equipment is evaluated with hardware simulation of nonlinear solid state power amplifier (SSPA) transponder.

Despite possessing many appealing features, CDMA distributed antenna (DA) systems suffer from low capacity per antenna element (AE) as a result of the multiple access interference (MAI) accumulated in the common feeder. To overcome this capacity limitation, we propose an antenna architecture called CDMA sectorized distributed antenna (SDA). In an SDA system, a cell has many sectors in which separate feeders run, so MAI in the reverse link is reduced. In this study, the limiting case of one AE per sector is investigated. In such a case, a wireless user's signal can be picked up by all the AEs in an SDA cell, and then, can be optimally combined at a central station. It is demonstrated analytically and through simulations that in the reverse link of such a system, the SIR increases approximately linearly with an increasing number of AEs, which can be transformed into an equivalent increase in capacity and/or information rate.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.722486","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

For this, we should be able to minimize the cell search time which is much longer than in case of synchronous operation. A new code assignment scheme is proposed for the forward pilot channel using short spreading codes, in which a group code is assigned to the in-phase (I) pilot channel of all cells belonging to the group, and a cell-specific code is assigned to the quadrature (Q) pilot channel of each cell in the group. Based on the code assignment, the mobile station first searches a group code by processing the I channel, and then detect a cell-specific code from the Q channel, resulting in fast cell search. As a decision algorithm, a SPRT (sequential probability ratio test) is used to further reduce the acquisition time of the I/Q multiplexed code. It is demonstrated through simulation that cell search can be finished in less than about 200 ms at 90% of the locations when 8 group codes and 64 cell-specific codes are assigned to 512 cell sites.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.722495","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

A detailed theoretical analysis of the steady-state probability density function (PDF) and variance of the tracking jitter is performed by solving the first-order Fokker-Planck equation, and the mean loss-of-lock time of the loop is derived. Numerical evaluation of the PDF is done and compared to the Gaussian distribution. Numerical results of the variance of the tracking jitter and the mean time to lose lock are also presented to illustrate the tracking performance for Gold code sequences. Optimal performance is evaluated minimizing the variance of the tracking jitter, by proper selection of the loop offset.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

To utilize both cells, the test statistic is composed of the observation on the couple of adjacent cells by the given type of the detector and the acquisition process is modeled by a four-state Markov chain. As an application of this general approach, the non-coherent matched filter detector acquisition of BPSK direct sequence spread-spectrum signals over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is analyzed. The mean acquisition time is evaluated for various values of system parameters. The comparisons with that of the conventional cell-by-cell serial search acquisition system show that at almost the same cost a significant improvement can be achieved and a much more robust mean acquisition time performance against the change of the threshold or the signal-to-noise ratio per chip (SNR/chip) can be reached.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.722498","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

A multi-user detector, consisting of a matched filter bank is considered and we demonstrate an example in which the resulting space requires a non-linear decision boundary. Such a boundary may be realised via an RBF network, but the complexity of this approach increases rapidly with the number of active users. The behaviour of the RBF decision boundary as the background noise is reduced motivates our proposal for a receiver which makes its estimate simply by taking the weight associated with the centre which is nearest to the soft output vector from the matched filter bank. Simulations of the performance of this nearest neighbour receiver show very close agreement with the conventional Gaussian RBF network. Interpreting the nearest neighbour boundary as a subset of the Voronoi diagram for the centres of the network allows an axiomatic method for discarding the number of centres which are considered in the comparison, and the performance of a receiver based on this reduced set of centres is shown to provide a compromise between the excellent error performance of the RBF network, and the computational simplicity of a linear filter.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.722507","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

It is shown that the linear PIC, whether conventional or weighted, can be seen as a linear matrix filter applied directly to the received chip-matched filtered signal vector. It is then possible to get an analytical expression for the exact bit error rate and to derive necessary conditions on the eigenvalues of the code correlation matrix and the weighting factors to ensure convergence. The close relationship between the steepest descent method for minimising the mean squared error (MSE) and linear PIC is demonstrated and a modified PIC structure is suggested which converges to the PMMSE detector rather than the decorrelator. Following the principles of the steepest descent method techniques are devised for optimising the choice of weighting factors with respect to the mean squared error. It is shown that only K (the number of users) PIC stages are required for the equivalent matrix filter to be identical to the MMSE filter. For fewer stages, m<K, one unique optimal choice of weighting factors exists which will lead to the minimum achievable MSE at the last stage.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

However, its performance is limited by the existence of multiple access interference energy (MAI), which results in the so called near-far problem. To reduce the MAI effect, different structures for multiuser separators have been proposed. Among these are different decorrelating detectors, adaptive and non-adaptive. One of these adaptive decorrelators is the so called \"bootstrap\" decorrelator. To further improve performance, multi-stage receivers has also been proposed using as a second stage a fixed canceler that depends on knowing the signals amplitude or an adaptive canceler that needs no such knowledge. All these different detection methods assumed BPSK modulation. For high bit/cycle modulation such as QAM, one can extend the BPSK based detectors by modifying them to PAM and handle the I and Q rails separately. However, considering the QAM as complex modulation signals, we propose in this paper the generalized complex bootstrap, and implement it in a multi-stage receiver, which can handle multiuser M-QAM data. Simulation results showed the adequacy of the scheme in improving the performance of the detection by reducing the MAI.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.722514","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

This paper addresses a few issues of importance when SDMA techniques are used in a cellular CDMA system. Firstly a theoretical analysis of a SDMA/CDMA system is performed. The analysis is focused on a single cell, multipath Rayleigh fading scenario. As system performance measure, the bit error rate (BER) is used as the criterion to investigate the influence of user location and number of antennas. An important parameter in a SDMA system is the antenna array element spacing. In our analysis a uniform linear array (ULA) is considered and a measure is defined to determine the optimal antenna element spacing in a CDMA cellular environment. Normally the mobile users in a cell are assumed to be uniformly distributed in cellular performance calculations. To reflect a more realistic situation, we propose a novel probability density function for the nonuniform distribution of the mobile users in the cell. It is shown that multipath, even with antenna arrays, reduces the system performance substantially.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

Impulse radio is an ultra-wideband code division multiple access (UWB-CDMA) technique being considered as the physical layer for future networks. Impulse radio exhibits low power spectral density and relatively high immunity to fading but suffers from relatively long acquisition times. In traditional packet radio networks (PRNs), the physical layer link is terminated while scheduling half-duplex transmissions or in the absence of data packets. To re-establish physical layer links in an impulse radio system, signaling packets containing exceptionally long acquisition headers transmitted at higher powers are required. Hence, to improve covertness in an impulse radio based network, we propose a MAC layer scheme we call sustained link networks (SLN) where the physical layer links are maintained continuously. We develop a full-duplexing scheme which takes advantage of the low duty cycle nature of impulse radio to maintain physical layer links capable of supporting bi-directional data transfer. During the periods between data bursts, the physical layer links are maintained by transmitting supplementary data at low bit rates and low power levels. We quantify the performance of an impulse radio receiver implementing the full-duplex scheme developed. We also present performance comparisons of an SLN based on impulse radio with traditional PRN variations implemented using impulse radio.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1998.722545","publicationTitle":"IEEE Military Communications Conference.

For the single-cell case, it was shown previously that interference caused to the narrowband system by CDMA users is significant, even when the CDMA system is very lightly-loaded. The use of notch filtering at the CDMA transmitter to avoid active narrowband users was shown to greatly alleviate the effects of the CDMA interference on the narrowband system. It was also demonstrated that the MMSE receiver can perform well in receiving these filtered CDMA signals. In this paper, overlay is applied to the cellular case, in which the narrowband users in each cell only utilize a fraction of the system bandwidth even when the system is fully loaded. As in the single-cell case, it is seen that overlay causes significant degradation to the narrowband system, which can again be alleviated greatly through the use of transmitter notch-filtering.

In a tactical military application, the basic message may represent a voice message, while the additional message may correspond to a digitized image. We investigate adaptive modulation and coding techniques based on our previous schemes, and we apply the adaptive techniques to a cellular communication system that employs direct-sequence spread-spectrum multiple access, also known as code-division multiple access (CDMA). In a cellular CDMA system each mobile terminal experiences variations in both the received signal strength and the interference. We show that by adapting the parameters of the modulation and coding to the signal-to-interference ratio, the throughput can be increased for the additional message while maintaining an acceptable error rate for the basic message.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1998.722555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Military Communications Conference.

However, modulated signals are polycyclostationary (PCS): their correlation functions are time-polyperiodic. Cyclic equalization structures optimized by the MMSE (minimum mean square error) criterion are proposed. The proposed structure is based on a multidimensional input. The latter is built from the received signal possibly shifted by its cyclic frequencies. We show by simulation that the proposed cyclic structures give better performance in terms of binary error rate than the conventional equalizers. The paper is organized as follows. First, we review some background topics on cyclostationarity and optimum filtering of PCS signals. Then we calculate the expressions of the forward and backward filters for the cyclic DFE and deduce the expression of the linear cyclic equalizer. Finally, simulation results of conventional and cyclic equalizers are given for BPSK and MSK signals jammed by other modulated signals. The new cyclic structures are particularly suitable for FDMA networks disturbed by adjacent channel interference (ACI). They can lead to a significant improvement in the number of communication channels within a given bandwidth. Besides, cyclic structures can also be used for transmission links disturbed by jammers that are modulated signals with the same or different baud rates.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Personal communication networks","Jamming","Digital communication","Mean square error methods","Multidimensional systems","Frequency","Error analysis","Filtering","Nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","decision feedback equalisers","digital communication","adjacent channel interference","filtering theory","phase shift keying","minimum shift keying","frequency division multiple access","multiuser channels","jamming","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE cyclic equalization","digital communications","decision feedback equalizers","stationary signals","modulated signals","polycyclostationary signals","time-polyperiodic correlation functions","minimum mean square error","multidimensional input","cyclic frequencies","cyclic structures","performance","binary error rate","optimum filtering","cyclostationarity filtering","forward filters","backward filters","cyclic DFE","linear cyclic equalizer","simulation results","MSK signals","BPSK signals","FDMA networks","adjacent channel interference","ACI","communication channels","bandwidth","transmission links","baud rates"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1998.722562","startPage":"150","endPage":"154 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Military Communications Conference.

Each user in the system owns a subset of orthogonal sequences, whereby the different subsets of sequences are not disjoint-a given sequence may be shared by more than one user. Thus, the system needs fewer orthogonal sequences, compared to a system which does not employ sequence sharing. Since, in our system, sequence collision is an inevitable problem, we investigate branch-, user- and system-collision-free probabilities for each sequence assignment. In order to achieve a collision-free design at the system level, a low-complexity protocol for coordinating users' start times is put forward. With this protocol, codes (sequences) and times-of-arrival are used in combination to distinguish the signals of different users. Numerical results and comparisons are provided to illustrate the performance of the scheme, and our analytical results are supported by simulations.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1998.722578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Military Communications Conference.

Multi-code DS-CDMA allows different information rates by varying the number of spreading codes assigned to each user. Power control is used to achieve a set of target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs), and an outage occurs if a user must increase the transmitted power above a maximum power limit. To compete the outage probability, we derive an accurate approximation for the variance of received SINR over the user population assuming MMSE detection with short spreading codes. Outage probability is then shown as a function of the number of codes assigned to each user.

The SCPS stack consists of a set of four protocols that operate at the network layer and above: file handling protocol (FP), transport protocol (TP), security protocol (SP), and network protocol (NP). This set of protocols has the potential to increase the efficiency and reliability of data transfer, increase interoperability with both DOD and non-DOD assets, and decrease the cost of operating our space systems. The protocols also have potential applicability to military tactical and mobile communication environments. Two experiments and a number of simulations were conducted in FY96 to evaluate the performance of a subset of the SCPS protocols. This paper summarizes the results of a third test program which was developed in FY97 to further evaluate the performance of SCPS. Although this test program did address functional testing of FP and NP, the focus was on the end-to-end performance of SCPS TP and commercial transmission control protocol (TCP) in networks that include at least one satellite communications link.","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1998.722583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Military Communications Conference.

The results presented in this paper are obtained from a simulation of a wireless FH radio network in which the characteristics of the links are time-varying.

The tap weights of the adaptive beamformer are controlled by two adaptive algorithms such as direct matrix inversion (DMI) and linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV). The large sample maximum likelihood (LSML) estimator is applied to the beamformer output data for estimating the propagation delay of a desired user in multi-user scenarios. The proposed approach is shown to provide better performance than that of a single antenna based LSML estimator via simulation results for 0 dB and 10 dB near-far ratio (NFR) situations. In addition, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) given M observation bits of received signals from multiple antenna sensors is derived for the parameter estimation problem.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Military Communications Conference.

This is not simply due to the translation of the object across the image plane; complications arise due to the fact that the object undergoes changes in pose relative to the viewing camera, in illumination relative to light sources, and may even become partially or fully occluded. We develop an efficient general framework for object tracking, which addresses each of these complications. We first develop a computationally efficient method for handling the geometric distortions produced by changes in pose. We then combine geometry and illumination into an algorithm that tracks large image regions using no more computation than would be required to track with no accommodation for illumination changes. Finally, we augment these methods with techniques from robust statistics and treat occluded regions on the object as statistical outliers. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.","doi":"10.1109/34.722606","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","startPage":"1025","endPage":"1039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel4/34/15627/00722606.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.722606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient region tracking with parametric models of geometry and illumination","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parametric statistics","Lighting","Target tracking","Motion estimation","Cameras","Robustness","Light sources","Computational geometry","Video sequences","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","motion estimation","image sequences","optical tracking","lighting","computational geometry","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["region tracking","parametric models","computational geometry","illumination","object tracking","geometric distortions","light sources","image regions","statistical outliers","machine vision","motion estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Efficient region tracking with parametric models of geometry and illumination","volume":"20","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6072824","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722606/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient region tracking with parametric models of geometry and illumination","sourcePdf":"00722606.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056445S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"757","articleId":"722606","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":722607,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The 44 GHz amplifier is based on an InP HBT technology with f/sub T/s and f/sub max/s of 70 GHz and 200 GHz respectively. The single stage design consists of four pre-matched 1/spl times/10 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ four-finger HBT cells combined in parallel which consumes 48 mA of current through a 2.5 V supply. At this bias, the amplifier obtains a gain of 5.5-6 dB over a 44-50 GHz frequency band and achieves a peak gain of 6.8-7.6 dB under a bias current of 80 mA. At the low bias current of 48 mA and a total DC power of 120 mW, the amplifier obtains a peak IP3 of 34 dBm at 42 GHz which corresponds to a record IP3/P/sub DC/ power ratio of 21:1, a factor of 2 better than the state-of-the-art MMCs reported in this frequency range. The IP3 characteristics of the 44 GHz amplifier also indicate that the maximum IP3 and optimum 1P3/P/sub DC/ LFOM both occur at lower V/sub ce/'s for low current density operation, enabling the high LFOM. These characteristics make InP HBTs attractive for low power MM-wave receiver applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High power amplifiers","Frequency","Indium phosphide","Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Gain","Linearity","MMICs","Millimeter wave technology","Operational amplifiers","Current density"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indium compounds","III-V semiconductors","millimetre wave amplifiers","bipolar MIMIC","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit technology","MMIC amplifiers","heterojunction bipolar transistors","bipolar analogue integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high IP3","low DC power","InP HBT amplifier","linearity figure of merit","MMIC amplifier","millimeter-wave frequencies","InP HBT technology","single stage design","prematched four-finger HBT cells","parallel configuration","IP3 characteristic","low power MM-wave receiver applications","EHF","42 to 50 GHz","70 GHz","200 GHz","48 mA","80 mA","2.5 V","6.8 to 7.6 dB","120 mW","InP"]}],"doi":"10.1109/GAAS.1998.722613","publicationTitle":"GaAs IC Symposium.

Consider a point p on a smooth surface S and a closed curve /spl gamma/ on S which encloses p. The image of /spl gamma/ on the unit normal Gaussian sphere is a new curve /spl beta/. The Gaussian curvature at p is defined as the ratio of the area enclosed by /spl gamma/ over the area enclosed by /spl beta/ as /spl gamma/ contracts to p. The sign of Gaussian curvature at p is determined by the relative orientations of the closed curves /spl gamma/ and /spl beta/. We directly compute the relative orientation of two such curves from intensity data. We employ three unknown illumination conditions to create a photometric scatter plot. This plot is in one-to-one correspondence with the subset of the unit Gaussian sphere containing the mutually illuminated surface normal. This permits direct computation of the sign of Gaussian curvature without the recovery of surface normals. Our method is albedo invariant. We assume diffuse reflectance, but the nature of the diffuse reflectance can be general and unknown. Error analysis on simulated images shows the accuracy of our technique. We also demonstrate the performance of this methodology on empirical data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6072826","volume":"20","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sign of Gaussian curvature from curve orientation in photometric space","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sign of Gaussian curvature from curve orientation in photometric space","sourcePdf":"00722615.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030423S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"18","articleId":"722615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":722616,"authors":[{"name":"M.

First, we present a linear time algorithm that, given a strictly locally testable language, learns its deterministic finite state automaton in the limit from only positive data. This provides one with a practical and efficient method for learning a specific concept domain of sequence analysis. We then describe several experimental results using the learning algorithm developed above. Following a theoretical observation which strongly suggests that a certain type of amino acid sequences can be expressed by a locally testable language, we apply the learning algorithm to identifying the protein /spl alpha/-chain region in amino acid sequences for hemoglobin. Experimental scores show an overall success rate of 95% correct identification for positive data, and 96% for negative data.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel4/34/15627/00722617.pdf","startPage":"1067","endPage":"1079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/34.722617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.722617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=722617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning local languages and their application to DNA sequence analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DNA","Sequences","Splicing","Testing","Amino acids","Learning automata","Algorithm design and analysis","Proteins","Formal languages","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","pattern recognition","DNA","formal languages","finite automata","deterministic automata","proteins","biology computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DNA sequence analysis","learning algorithm","strictly locally testable languages","protein","/spl alpha/-chain region","amino acid","linear time algorithm","finite state automaton","hemoglobin","pattern recognition","machine learning","deterministic automata"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722617/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Learning local languages and their application to DNA sequence analysis","volume":"20","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6072827","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning local languages and their application to DNA sequence analysis","sourcePdf":"00722617.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048861S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"22","articleId":"722617","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":722618,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Once generated, these ANN models are inserted into commercial microwave circuit simulators where they can be used for computer-aided design (CAD) and optimization of microwave/MM-wave circuits. Also, the developed ANN models can give physical insight into device behavior and scaling properties when used in conjunction with an equivalent circuit approach. An advantage of the ANN modeling approach is that it provides substantial data storage reduction over previously used modeling techniques without loss of accuracy. With increased model accuracy, the potential of first-pass design success may be realized, resulting in cost savings and decreased time-to-market for new products.","doi":"10.1109/GAAS.1998.722636","startPage":"95","endPage":"98","publicationTitle":"GaAs IC Symposium.

To our knowledge this is the fastest static divider reported in any semiconductor technology. The divider was realized in a high yield optical lithography triple mesa HBT process. At maximum speed, power consumption was 40 mW/flip-flop. A second 1/8 divider, designed for lower power but using the same size transistors, consumed 8.6 mW/flip-flop at 35 GHz. Sensitivity was excellent with the high-speed version operating from DC to 48 GHz with less than 0 dBm input power. Uniformity and reproducibility were also demonstrated; all functional dividers operated above 45 GHz on-wafer and the extrapolated yield of dividers indicates that the process is capable of supporting 500-1000 transistor designs. Circuit performance was relatively insensitive to the details of the device epitaxial structure indicating a highly robust and manufacturable process.","doi":"10.1109/GAAS.1998.722642","publicationTitle":"GaAs IC Symposium.

We first give a thorough derivation of two recently proposed adaptive detection structures. Next, we derive a different detection scheme exploiting the assumption that the clutter is wide-sense stationary. Resorting to the theory of circulant matrices, in fact, we demonstrate that the estimation of the structure of the clutter covariance matrix can be reduced to the estimation of its eigenvalues, which in turn can be (efficiently) done via fast Fourier transform codes. After a thorough performance assessment, mostly carried on via computer simulations, the results show that the newly proposed detector achieves better performance than the two previously introduced adaptive detectors. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis shows that, even though this detector does not strictly guarantee the constant false alarm rate property with respect to the clutter covariance matrix, it is robust, in the sense that its performance is only slightly affected by variations in the clutter temporal correlation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/15626/00722671.pdf","startPage":"1058","endPage":"1069","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.722671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.722671","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15626","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=722671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive detection schemes in compound-Gaussian clutter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clutter","Radar detection","Covariance matrix","Detectors","Statistics","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Fast Fourier transforms","Computer simulation","Sensitivity analysis","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar detection","radar clutter","radar cross-sections","covariance matrices","adaptive signal detection","fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compound-Gaussian clutter","adaptive detection schemes","radar detection","coherent pulse trains","partially known statistics","circulant matrices","clutter covariance matrix","eigenvalues","fast Fourier transform codes","performance assessment","computer simulation","sensitivity analysis","temporal correlation variations","Toeplitz structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive detection schemes in compound-Gaussian clutter","volume":"34","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6064966","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive detection schemes in compound-Gaussian clutter","sourcePdf":"00722671.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028903S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"101","articleId":"722671","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":722672,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Convexity and symmetry properties of the ambiguity function over range, velocity, and acceleration are presented; these are useful for determining region and speed of convergence for recursive algorithms used to compute the MLE. In addition, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is computed in closed form which shows that the velocity bound is decoupled from the corresponding bounds in range and acceleration. A fast MLE is then proposed which uses the Hough transform (HT) to initialize the MLE algorithm.

The benchmark problem involves beam pointing control of a phased array (i.e., agile beam) radar against highly maneuvering targets in the presence of false alarms (FAs) and electronic counter measurements (ECM). The testbed simulation described includes the effects of target amplitude fluctuations, beamshape, missed detections, FAs, finite resolution, target maneuvers, and track loss. Multiple waveforms are included in the benchmark so that the radar energy can be coordinated with the tracking algorithm.

The limits on the position and maneuverability of the targets are given along with descriptions of six target trajectories.

MPDA is capable of exploiting multipath target signatures arising from discrete propagation modes that are resolvable by the radar. Nonlinear measurement models exhibiting multipath target signatures in azimuth, slant range, and Doppler are used. Tracking is performed in ground coordinates and therefore depends on the provision of estimates of virtual ionospheric heights to achieve coordinate registration. Although the propagation mode characteristics are assumed to be known, their correspondence with the detections is not required to be known. A target existence model is included for automatic track maintenance. Numerical simulations for four resolvable propagation modes are presented that demonstrate the ability of the technique to initiate and maintain track at probabilities of detection of 0.4 per mode in clutter densities for which conventional probabilistic data association (PDA) has a high probability of track loss, and suffers from track bias. A nearest neighbor version of MPDA is also presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multipath data association tracker for over-the-horizon radar","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/7.722704","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/15626/00722704.pdf","startPage":"1165","endPage":"1183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.722704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15626","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=722704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722704/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"A multipath data association tracker for over-the-horizon radar","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6072677","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multipath data association tracker for over-the-horizon radar","sourcePdf":"00722704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065658S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"75","articleId":"722704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":722708,"authors":[{"name":"N.A.

The susceptibility of DGPS transmissions to both intentional and nonintentional interference/jamming and spoofing must be addressed before DGPS may be safely used as a major component of such a critical navigational device. This research applies multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) techniques to the problem of detecting and identifying interference/jamming and spoofing in the DGPS signal. Such an MMAE is composed of a bank of parallel filters, each hypothesizing a different failure status, along with an evaluation of the current probability of each hypothesis being correct, to form a probability-weighted average state estimate as an output. For interference/jamming degradation represented as increased measurement noise variance, simulation results show that, because of the good failure detection and isolation (FDI) performance using MMAE, the blended navigation performance is essentially that of a single extended Kalman filter (EKF) artificially informed of the actual interference noise variance. However, a standard MMAE is completely unable to detect spoofing failures (modeled as a bias or ramp offset signal directly added to the measurement). This work describes a moving-bank pseudoresidual MMAE (PRMMAE) to detect and identify such spoofing. Using the PRMMAE algorithm, spoofing is very effectively detected and isolated; the resulting navigation performance is equivalent to that of an EKF operating in an environment without spoofing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722708/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6072680","volume":"34","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detection of interference/jamming and spoofing in a DGPS-aided inertial system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of interference/jamming and spoofing in a DGPS-aided inertial system","sourcePdf":"00722708.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042187S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"66","articleId":"722708","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":722710,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

A new class of odd-periodic binary sequences is constructed that exist for many more lengths and exhibit significantly lower mismatched filtering losses than any known periodic sequences.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering","Binary sequences","Matched filters","Autocorrelation","Radar measurements","Signal to noise ratio","Length measurement","Radar applications","Transmitters","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","binary sequences","correlation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mismatched filtering","odd-periodic binary sequences","filtering losses","signal-to-noise ratio","odd-periodic autocorrelation function"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.722719","startPage":"1345","endPage":"1349","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/15626/00722719.pdf","doi":"10.1109/7.722719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mismatched filtering of odd-periodic binary sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Mismatched filtering of odd-periodic binary sequences","accessionNumber":"6072691","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","volume":"34","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mismatched filtering of odd-periodic binary sequences","sourcePdf":"00722719.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04406S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"19","articleId":"722719","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":722721,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A stepped-frequency polyphase code (SFPC) waveform is proposed as a generic UWB waveform whose interference with the external RF sources is significantly reduced. The subpulses of the individual stepped-frequency (SF) pulses are phase coded using small phase perturbations. This results in a waveform which places nulls at the frequency locations of the external RF sources. Because the phase perturbations are small, a mismatched filter which uses the unperturbed pulses (no phase modulation) as a reference signal results in a simple receiver design and a small mismatch loss on receive. Furthermore, the proposed methodology also has application to narrowband or wideband radars.","doi":"10.1109/7.722721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/15626/00722721.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.722721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15626","startPage":"1356","endPage":"1361","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thinned spectrum ultrawideband waveforms using stepped-frequency polyphase codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=722721","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Thinned spectrum ultrawideband waveforms using stepped-frequency polyphase codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722721/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6072693","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thinned spectrum ultrawideband waveforms using stepped-frequency polyphase codes","sourcePdf":"00722721.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06169S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"46","articleId":"722721","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":722726,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Part I deals with differential morphology and curve evolution. The partial differential equations (PDEs) that model basic morphological operations are first presented. The resulting dilation PDE, numerically implemented by curve evolution algorithms, improves the accuracy of morphological multiscale analysis by Euclidean disks and (its anisotropic/heterogeneous version) is the basic ingredient of PDE models that solve image analysis problems such as gridless halftoning and watershed segmentation based on the eikonal PDE. Part II deals with morphology-related systems for pattern recognition. It presents a general class of multilayer feedforward neural networks where the combination of inputs in every node is formed by hybrid linear and nonlinear (of the morphological/rank type) operations. For its design a methodology is formulated using ideas from the backpropagation algorithm and robust techniques are developed to circumvent the non-differentiability of rank functions. Experimental results in handwritten character recognition are described and illustrate some of the properties of this new type of neural nets.","doi":"10.1109/SIBGRA.1998.722726","startPage":"10","endPage":"17","publicationTitle":"Proceedings SIBGRAPI'98.

This estimation is crucial for the problem of crowd monitoring and control. The assessment is carried out on a set of nearly 300 real images captured from Liverpool Street Train Station, London, UK, using texture measures extracted from the images through the following four different methods: gray level dependence matrices, straight line segments, Fourier analysis, and fractal dimensions. The estimations of crowd densities are given in terms of the classification of the input images in five classes of densities (very low, low, moderate, high and very high). Three types of classifiers are used: neural (implemented according to the Kohonen model), Bayesian, and an approach based on fitting functions. The results obtained by these three classifiers, using the four texture measures, allowed the conclusion that, for the problem of crowd density estimation, texture analysis is very effective.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIBGRA.1998.722773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15625","publicationTitle":"Proceedings SIBGRAPI'98.

An example of a current-testable operational amplifier has been designed, and the small test circuitry required for current injection has a negligible impact on circuit performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/722810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1998","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-16 Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6161752","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Current-testable high-frequency CMOS operational amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current-testable high-frequency CMOS operational amplifiers","confLoc":"Rochester, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00722810.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035191S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1998","isNumber":"15621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5864","citationCount":"3","articleId":"722810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":722817,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo-Hsing Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei-Hsien, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kuo-Hsing Cheng","id":"37275533300"},{"name":"Shu-Min Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei-Hsien, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shu-Min Chiang","id":"37366144900"},{"name":"Shun-Wen Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, Taipei-Hsien, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shun-Wen Cheng","id":"37276497600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4980-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-0988"}],"articleNumber":"722817","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":157},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The improvement of conditional sum adder for low power applications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Eleventh Annual IEEE International ASIC Conference (Cat.

This spectral sound processing was implemented on a computer board for simulation, and on a 'DSP' board (digital signal processor) of GRAMS' cochlear prosthesis for stimulating current generation. The algorithm includes different desired specifications, which are designed to be adjustable. Our purpose is to satisfy auditory pathological constraints of cochlear implant recipients having unique and diverse needs.

This fact has severe consequences for the efficient indexing and retrieval of information from documents in large unstructured collections (e.g. WWW), because it is very difficult to automatically identify generic meanings from visual or audible objects. A novel method for image retrieval from large collections is proposed in this paper. The method is based on color co-occurrence descriptors that utilize compact representations of essential information of the visual image content. The set of descriptor elements represents \"elementary\" color segments, their borders, and their mutual spatial distribution on the image frame. Such representation is flexible enough to describe image scenes ranging from simple combinations of color segments to high frequency color textures equally well. At the retrieval stage the comparison between a given query descriptor and the database descriptors is performed by a similarity measure. Image descriptors are robust versus affine transformations and several other image distortions. The consideration of the descriptors as sets of elements allows the combination of several images or subimages into a single query. Basic properties of the method are demonstrated experimentally on an image database containing 20000 images.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MULMM.1998.722972","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 MultiMedia Modeling.

Since the fault symptom relationships are not always known beforehand, a system is needed which can be learned from experimental or simulated data. A fuzzy logic based diagnosis is advantageous. It allows an easy incorporation of a-priori known rules and also enables the user to understand the inference of the system. In this contribution, a new diagnosis scheme is presented and applied to a DC motor. The approach is based on a combination of structural a-priori knowledge and measured data in order to create a hierarchical diagnosis system that can be adapted to different motors.

The first driving force for the introduction of this technology was the need to achieve increased speed and performance along with higher I/O count. A breakthrough, however, will be the use of flip chip due to cost reduction. For this aim, it is essential to use low cost bumping techniques in combination with an assembly method compatible with existing SMT processes. The FC techniques presented in this paper are all based on an electroless Ni/Au bumping process which has been developed by TUB/IZM and implemented into production by Pac Tech. This paper shows a roadmap based on electroless nickel/gold bumping for all flip chip interconnection technologies used in industry at present. Additionally, the roadmap to future developments in semiconductor industry based on 300 mm wafers and the use of new pad metallisations such as copper is shown. The compatibility of electroless nickel bumping in particular with these new technologies to be implemented in wafer manufacturing within the next millenium shows that this key technology offers a roadmap to flip chip technology not only for the products and wafer technologies in use at present, but also for next generation wafer technologies.","doi":"10.1109/IEMTE.1998.723060","publicationTitle":"Twenty Second IEEE/CPMT International Electronics Manufacturing Technology Symposium.

As device scaling approaches ever smaller regimes, multiple layer device fabrication is necessary to increase chip integration up to and beyond the gigascale regime. This paper presents multiple layer SOI (MLSOI) islands fabricated using Si SEG and ELO. The MLSOI fabrication process used was an extension of the single layer SOI island process (Neudeck et al, 1997). The first SOI layer was created by forming oxide wells via oxidation, RIE oxide etch, and re-oxidation. Adjacent to the wells, a SEG/ELO seed window is opened. SEG/ELO was grown from the seed window and laterally over the field oxide until the recessed oxide wells were filled. Excess SEG/ELO over the recess wells was removed by CMP down to the field oxide level, isolating Si in the recessed wells from the seed and thus creating SOI active device islands. The second SOI layer was similarly fabricated, but a PECVD oxide was used to create the next recessed well layer. The PECVD oxide layer wells were created by timed RIE or wet etching, but an intermediate etch stop layer can be incorporated by using LPCVD Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/ prior to oxide PECVD. By repeating the fabrication process presented, additional SOI layers can be fabricated. The potential benefits of MLSOI designs are immense. Packing densities can be dramatically increased.

The double-gate (DG) fully-depleted (FD) silicon-on-insulator (SOI) MOSFET has an ideal subthreshold slope, high drive current and superb short channel effect immunity, which makes it very attractive in low-voltage, low-power, and high-performance CMOS designs. In this paper, by solving the Poisson equation, we propose a general model which has been verified by SOI-SPICE simulations. Based on this model, DGSOI MOSFETs are compared with conventional single gate FD SOI (SGSOI) MOSFETs, and the design and optimization of DGSOI MOSFETs in terms of circuit delay, power dissipation and power delay product are presented. In our analysis, we focus on FD DGSOI transistors without volume inversion, where the classical method is still valid.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/723115/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 1998","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6181657","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and optimization of double-gate SOI MOSFETs for low voltage low power circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and optimization of double-gate SOI MOSFETs for low voltage low power circuits","confLoc":"Stuart, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00723115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055729S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 1998","isNumber":"15630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5870","citationCount":"6","articleId":"723115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":723144,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In practical devices, the limit is 8 nm due to stress induced leakage after program and erase cycles. Nitridation reduces electron trapping but does not decrease the lower thickness limit. Operating voltages also do not scale well in flash memories. Voltages required for operation range from 10-12 V for channel hot electron stacked gate devices to up to 20 V for Fowler-Nordheim tunnel/erase devices. This places limits on transistor channel and isolation scaling. Looking ahead, cell scaling beyond 0.13 /spl mu/m will be difficult unless there is a major breakthrough. Multilevel cell storage technology provides a cost effective alternative to process scaling. Feasibility studies showed that up to 16 levels or 4 bits per cell is possible with stacked gate technology. Stacked gate flash memory cells using channel hot electron programming are best suited for high density multilevel cell technology.","doi":"10.1109/NVMT.1998.723204","publicationTitle":"Seventh Biennial IEEE International Nonvolatile Memory Technology Conference.

These include fast write speeds, unlimited operation without wear-out, no data loss with high shock and power loss, and small chip size. A nonvolatile memory component that has the characteristics needed for high shock recorders and other microcontroller applications can be constructed in a cost effective and shock resistant die which is 0.25\" on a side using standard CMOS processing. The 256K component described here uses giant magnetoresistive material (GMR), which provides a larger signal than anisotropic magnetoresistive material (AMR) based devices and can be used in bits scaled to sub-/spl mu/m sizes. Small conventional mode bits can be used effectively in intermediate size magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM) components that fit a large microcontroller application market. Built-in dual redundant bits and spare sense lines allow a high product yield, thus providing additional potential production cost reductions. Future size reductions will occur when the pseudo spin valve bit has been sufficiently developed to be dropped into this design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/723215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Jun 1998","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"24-24 June 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6181635","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A practical 256K GMR NV memory for high shock applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical 256K GMR NV memory for high shock applications","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00723215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042032S","chronDate":"22-24 Jun 1998","isNumber":"15610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5858","citationCount":"1","articleId":"723215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":723216,"authors":[{"name":"S.

As Si-based devices shrink, interest is increasing in fast, low-power devices sensitive to small numbers of electrons. MOS structures with large Si nanocrystal arrays comprising a floating gate can be extremely fast, reliable and nonvolatile relative to conventional floating gate memories. Approximately one electron is stored per nanocrystal. Despite promising initial results, current devices have a charge transit time distribution during nanocrystal ensemble writing which limits speed. This behaviour is not completely understood, but may be due to dispersion in oxide thicknesses, nanocrystal interface states, or electronic bound state shifts due to size variations. To address these limitations, we developed an aerosol vapor synthesis/deposition technique for Si nanocrystals with active size classification, enabling narrow nanocrystal size distributions (/spl sim/10-15% of particles in 2-10 nm range). The first goal of the experiments was to use scanning probe techniques for particle manipulation and to characterize particle electronic properties and charging on a single-particle basis. Si nanocrystal structures were formed by contact mode operation and imaged in noncontact mode without further particle motion. Single nanocrystal charging by a conducting AFM tip was observed, detected as an apparent height change due to electrostatic force, followed by slow relaxation as the stored charge dissipates. Ongoing and future efforts are discussed, including nanocrystal size distribution narrowing, nanocrystal oxide thickness control, and measurement of electron transport through individual particles and ensembles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/723224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-24 June 1998","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"24-24 June 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6175458","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spatial and electronic manipulation of silicon nanocrystals by atomic force microscopy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial and electronic manipulation of silicon nanocrystals by atomic force microscopy","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00723224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037631S","chronDate":"24-24 June 1998","isNumber":"15610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5858","citationCount":"2","articleId":"723224","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":723260,"authors":[{"name":"G.C.

The distribution process itself, however, has changed little: programmers still manually divide applications into sub-programs and assign those sub-programs to machines with little automated assistance. Often, the techniques used to choose a distribution are ad hoc. Due to high intellectual cost, applications are seldom repartitioned even in drastically changing network environments. We describe Coign, an automatic distributed partitioning system (ADPS) that significantly facilitates the development of distributed applications. Given an application (in binary form) built from distributable COM components, Coign constructs a graph model of the application's intercomponent communication through scenario-based profiling. Later, Coign applies graph-cutting algorithms to partition the application across a network and minimize distribution costs. Using Coign, an end user without source code can transform a non-distributed application into an optimized, distributed application. Through a guided tour of Coign's architecture and usage, we present an overview of its features. We describe the automatic distributed partitioning of three applications: Microsoft Picture It!, the Octarine word processor, and the Corporate Benefits Sample program. All are distributed automatically, sometimes with startling results. For example, Coign makes significant changes to the programmer-assigned distribution of the Corporate Benefits Sample.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDOC.1998.723260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15623","startPage":"252","endPage":"262","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Second International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing (Cat.

This specifies the spatial frequency components which need to be measured in order to reconstruct an image completely contained within a known field of view (FOV). Here, the authors generalize this result in order to find the optimal k-space sampling for images that vanish except in multiple, possibly non-adjacent regions within the FOV. This provides the basis for \"multiple region\" Fourier imaging, a method of producing such images from a fraction of the k-space samples required by the WKS theorem. Sampling is optimal in the sense that it is minimal and does not lead to noise amplification during image reconstruction, just as for WKS sampling. Image reconstruction is computationally cheap because it is performed with small fast Fourier transforms. The new technique can also be used to reconstruct images that have low spatial frequency components throughout the entire FOV and high spatial frequencies (i.e. edges) confined to multiple small regions. The method's greater sampling efficiency can be parlayed into increased temporal or spatial resolution whenever the imaged objects have signal or \"edge\" intensity confined to multiple small portions of the FOV. The method may be applicable to various types of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, as well as to other Fourier imaging modalities and multi-band telecommunications. The technique is demonstrated by using it to reconstruct MR angiographic images of the carotid arteries of a volunteer.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Image sampling","Image reconstruction","Magnetic confinement","Magnetic resonance imaging","Frequency measurement","Magnetic field measurement","Fast Fourier transforms","Spatial resolution","Magnetic resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood vessels","biomedical MRI","fast Fourier transforms","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling theorems class","Fourier imaging","multiple regions","Whittaker-Kotel'nikov-Shannon sampling theorem","spatial frequency components","known field of view","optimal k-space sampling","multiple possibly nonadjacent regions","multiple region Fourier imaging","carotid arteries","multi-band telecommunications","volunteer","MR angiographic images reconstruction","magnetic resonance imaging","medical diagnostic imaging"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1998.723307","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

In this paper, this problem is considered in a regularization framework: the sought solution minimizes an objective function (a criterion). Criteria defined over the set of the binary images are nonconvex and there are no general methods permitting one to calculate the global minimum, while approximate solutions are very often of limited interest. On the other hand, general-purpose reconstruction techniques, based on convex criteria, yield continuous-valued smooth estimates which are far from binarity. We propose two methods which are based on convex criteria and introduce binarity only partially. More precisely, we construct objective functions whose minimizers are continuous-valued but have a quasi-binary shape. In other words, these estimates are composed essentially of binary-valued pixels while nonbinary pixels are rare. According to our approach, the construction of these objective functions is based on analytical considerations. The resultant methods are stable and numerically attractive.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1998.723327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15601","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

In the second method, information data can be embedded by thresholding and modifying significant coefficients at the coarser scales in perceptually important spectral components of image signals.

By comparing correlation values from different portions of the image, the technique enables us to distinguish malicious changes, such as replacing/adding features from nonmalicious changes resulting from common image processing operations. The technique can be implemented with small memory and computational requirements, which makes it potentially useful for hardware implementation in digital cameras. The technique works by dividing an image into blocks and watermarking each block with a transparent, robust watermark that sensitively depends on a secret key (camera's ID) and continuously on the image. The watermarking method is a frequency based spread spectrum technique. To achieve a continuous dependency on the image, we propose a special bit extraction procedure that extracts bits from each block by thresholding projections onto key-dependent random smooth patterns. Those bits are then used for initializing a PRNG and synthesizing the spread spectrum signal.","pdfPath":"/iel4/5852/15601/00723401.pdf","startPage":"404","endPage":"408 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

Assuming that we are using a transform domain spread spectrum watermarking scheme, it is important to add the watermark in select coefficients with significant image energy in the transform domain in order to ensure non-erasability of the watermark. Previous methods, which did not use the original in the detection process, could not selectively add the watermark to the significant coefficients, since the locations of such selected coefficients can change due to image manipulations. Since watermark verification typically consists of a process of correlation which is extremely sensitive to the relative order in which the watermark coefficients are placed within the image, such changes in the location of the watermarked coefficients was unacceptable. We present a scheme which overcomes this problem of \"order sensitivity\". Advantages of the proposed method include (i) improved resistance to attacks on the watermark, (ii) implicit visual masking utilizing the time-frequency localization property of the wavelet transform and (iii) a robust definition for the threshold which validates the watermark. We present results comparing our method with previous techniques, which clearly validate our claims.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1998.723406","startPage":"419","endPage":"423 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

Super-resolution enhancement is achievable if objects within the image sequence move with subpixel increments; thus, the Bayesian HRVS algorithm requires subpixel-resolution motion fields estimated with respect to the I-picture. Half-pel resolution motion fields are provided by the MPEG encoder in the compressed bit stream. These motion vectors are used as initial conditions to a reduced-search block matching algorithm which calculates higher-resolution motion fields with acceptable accuracy. The computation time required to estimate the subpixel motion fields in the Bayesian HRVS algorithm is reduced by a factor of approximately 30 when lower-resolution motion vectors are already available from the MPEG decoder, with little degradation in video still quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/723427/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"6209067","conferenceDate":"7-7 Oct. 1998","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Extraction of high-resolution video stills from MPEG image sequences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extraction of high-resolution video stills from MPEG image sequences","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00723427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037381S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5852","citationCount":"17","articleId":"723427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":723428,"authors":[{"name":"E.

By placing a higher emphasis on the transform coefficients pertaining to the RoI, the RoI is coded with higher fidelity than the rest of the image in earlier stages of progressive reconstruction thus the \"important\" part of the image is reconstructed more quickly than the rest of the image. This method significantly saves transmission time and storage space by terminating encoding or transmission in situations where the RoI needs to be coded losslessly and the rest of the image visually losslessly (lossy). In our model, the RoI can be flexibly specified either in the beginning or in the middle of the encoding process (either on the original image or on the full- or low-resolution image reconstructed by the decoder), through interaction with the user at the transmitting or the receiving end. Also, the speed with which the quality of the RoI improves in progressive decoding is flexibly specified by the user at either end. The proposed method is especially advantageous in an application where the image is browsed interactively, e.g. telemedicine.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lossy/lossless region-of-interest image coding based on set partitioning in hierarchical trees","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1998.723428","startPage":"87","endPage":"91 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1998.723428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15617","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

The probability distribution function of a DCT coefficient can be divided into two regions using a threshold, so that one portion contains roughly equiprobable transform coefficients. While fixed-length coding, which is a powerful solution to the synchronization problem, is used in this inner equiprobable region without sacrificing compression, the outer (saturating) region is reserved for variable-length codes. The proposed image coder first encodes the bit allocated DCT coefficients using a fixed-rate quantizer bank, then the saturated values for these coefficients are encoded using an entropy constrained scalar quantizer, followed by an arithmetic encoder. Our simulations show that the proposed encoder is appropriate for applications in which an acceptable quality must always be maintained in any channel condition.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1998.723482","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1998.723482","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

However, such a scheme would not authenticate images that have undergone lossy compression, even though they may not have been manipulated otherwise. We propose a scheme for authenticating the visual content of digital images. This scheme is robust to compression noise, but will detect deliberate manipulation of the image-data. The proposed scheme is based on the extraction of feature-points from the image. These feature-points are defined so as to be relatively unaffected by lossy compression. The set of feature-points from a given image is encrypted using public key encryption, to generate the digital signature of the image. Authenticity is verified by comparing the feature-points of the image in question, with those recovered from the previously computed digital signature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/723518/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct 1998","conferenceDate":"7-7 Oct. 1998","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6195151","displayDocTitle":"Compression tolerant image authentication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compression tolerant image authentication","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00723518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022191S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5852","citationCount":"98","articleId":"723518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":723521,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

In this context, two fundamental questions are: (a) what is the maximum number of different watermarks that can be distinguished reliably? and (b) what are good design techniques for watermarking methods to approximate that maximum? Under the assumption that attacks can be modeled as additive noise, we provide answers to both questions. To answer (a), we first show how the process of inserting a watermark is analogous to that of storing bits in certain devices, and then we compute the storage capacity of these devices. To answer (b), we present a specific design of a modulator to store information in those devices. Numerical simulations reveal that although strongly suboptimal in the number of bits they can effectively store in an image, simple and very low complexity modulator designs are able to pack enough bits in an image to be useful in practice.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

This watermark is important for several imaging applications, including trusted camera, legal usage of images, medical archiving of images, news reporting, commercial image transaction, and others. In each of these applications, it is important to verify that the image has not been manipulated and that the image was originated by either a specific camera or a specific user. The verification (the watermark extraction) procedure uses a public key as in public key cryptography, and hence it can be performed by any person without the secure exchange of a secret key. This is very important in many applications (e.g., trusted camera, news reporting) where the exchange of a secret key is either not possible or undesirable.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Public key","Watermarking","Authentication","Cameras","Change detection algorithms","Pixel","Law","Legal factors","Biomedical imaging","Public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public key cryptography","image coding","message authentication","feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image integrity verification","image changes detection","image authentication","public key watermarking algorithm","pixel values","image size","imaging applications","trusted camera","medical image archiving","news reporting","watermark extraction","public key cryptography","digital watermarking"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1998.723526","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

Most of the time, the recovery of the original image from its degraded measurements is an ill-conditioned, underdetermined inverse problem. Here, stabilization is achieved via concave potential functions and minimization is carried out using Metropolis-type simulated annealing. Still, the ordinary approach can be subject to some convergence difficulties and it remains an ambitious challenge to take into account the mutual dependence between neighboring discontinuities. We first propose to improve convergence towards global minima through single-site updating in the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) space. For this purpose, a suitable restricted DWT space is introduced and it turns out that the resulting class of algorithms shows less sensitivity to the choice of the hyperparameters. Next, we show that the smoothness of the discontinuity field can be incorporated implicitly in a multiresolution framework by means of a simple penalty term defined on the high frequency channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

While these methods improve classification accuracy, they are not well suited to modeling complex contextual structure. In this paper, we propose a context model for multiscale segmentation which can capture very complex behaviors on both local and global scales. Our method works by using binary classification trees to model the transition probabilities between segmentations at adjacent scales. The classification trees can be efficiently trained to model essential aspects of contextual behavior. In addition, the data model in our approach is novel in the sense that it can incorporate the correlation among the wavelet feature vectors across scales. We apply our method to the problem of document segmentation to illustrate its usefulness.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1998.723575","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

An application independent approach to video segmentation is to detect temporally contiguous segments without significant content change between successive frames. Each such segment is termed a shot. A high-performance shot boundary detection-based video segmentation algorithm is proposed. The technique uses unsupervised clustering on a multiple feature input space, followed by a heuristic elimination process to detect, with almost perfect accuracy, shot boundaries in the video. With an extremely high accuracy coupled with a very small number of false positives, this algorithm outperforms most of the existing techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/723662/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"6201062","conferenceDate":"7-7 Oct. 1998","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A high-performance shot boundary detection algorithm using multiple cues","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-performance shot boundary detection algorithm using multiple cues","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00723662.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055709S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5852","citationCount":"50","articleId":"723662","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":723693,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The method is based on using a backpropagation based neural network for learning brightness patterns and associating them with range data. The network is designed to reconstruct surface range from localized intensity patches of 7/spl times/7 pixels. Two methods for training the network are investigated, one based on a novel weight diffusion process which enforces a local smoothness constraint and the other using the eigen coefficients of the input and output patterns which make the training computationally efficient. An elegant and simple method for integrating reconstructed surface patches by minimizing the sum squared error in overlapped areas is derived. Results are shown for reconstruction of simple shapes like cylinders, hyperboloids and paraboloids as well as complex shapes like facial structure from intensity images.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1998.723716","startPage":"972","endPage":"976 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

We investigate the fundamental trade-off between network overheads and the quality of routing decisions in the context of the source-directed link-state routing protocols proposed for future IP and ATM networks. Through extensive simulation experiments with several representative network topologies and traffic patterns, we uncover the effects of stale link-state information, random fluctuations in traffic load, and variations of the link-cost metric on the routing and signalling overheads. The paper concludes by summarizing our key results as a list of guidelines for designing efficient quality-of-service routing policies in large backbone networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.1998.723724","pdfPath":"/iel4/5855/15607/00723724.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"51","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Network Protocols (Cat.

Our implementation is based upon the algorithm developed in SRI's NIDES (next-generation intrusion detection expert system) project. Some modifications and improvements to NIDES/STAT are made for a more effective implementation in our environment. Also, three OSPF insider attacks (e.g., maxseq, maxage, and seq++ attacks) have been developed for evaluating the efficacy of detecting capability. The experiments were conducted on two different network routing testbeds. The results indicate that the proposed statistical mechanism is very effective in detecting these routing protocol attacks.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Network Protocols (Cat.

We then present flow signing and verification procedures based upon a tree chaining technique. Since a single signing/verification operation is amortized over many packets, these procedures improve signing and verification rates by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the approach of signing/verifying packets individually. Our procedures do not depend upon reliable delivery of packets, provide delay-bounded signing, and are thus suitable for delay-sensitive flows and multicast applications. To further improve our procedures, we propose several extensions to the Feige-Fiat-Shamir digital signature scheme to speed up both the signing and verification operations, as well as to allow \"adjustable and incremental\" verification. The extended scheme, called eFFS, is compared to four other digital signature schemes (RSA, DSA, ElGamal, Rabin). We compare their signing and verification times, as well as key and signature sizes. We observe that (i) the signing and verification operations of eFFS are highly efficient compared to the other schemes, (ii) eFFS allows a tradeoff between memory and signing/verification time, and (iii) eFFS allows adjustable and incremental verification by receivers.","doi":"10.1109/ICNP.1998.723740","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Sixth International Conference on Network Protocols (Cat.

The main contribution of this paper is a detailed design of the turbo decoder structure required to perform the required decoding steps, omitted by Pehkonen et al. The performance of the proposed iterative turbo coded DS/CDMA receiver is then studied in an mobile radio environment. Attention is focused on an 8-state rate 2/64 coded QPSK DS/CDMA system, in agreement with the rate offered by the IS-95 coding scheme. The bit error rate performance of the proposed coding scheme is evaluated by means of simulation and compared to that of a DS/CDMA system employing the IS-95 front-end coder for the reverse link channel.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.723806","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

The PC/SS system is an advanced multi-code direct sequence spread spectrum system for high-speed data transmission. Our previous works have shown that the Reed-Solomon (RS) coded PC/SS systems provide significant improvement in error rate performance over conventional DS/SS systems. To achieve further performance improvement in the PC/SS systems, error-and-erasure decoding techniques are implemented in the RS coded PC/SS receiver. To obtain the erasure location information, a threshold for the signal-to-noise ratio is set at the correlator output. Numerical results show that the coded PC/SS systems with error-and-erasure decoding provides significant improvement in the bit error rate (BER). With errors-only decoding, the PC/SS systems cannot improve the error rate performance because of large SNR penalty introduced by coding. On the contrary, error-and erasure decoding still improves the performance of PC/SS systems under multiple access environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of parallel combinatorial CDMA systems with side information","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

The smart antenna concept followed in this paper takes advantage of the directional inhomogeneity of the mobile radio channel by applying direction-finding (DF) and beamforming (BF) algorithms in conjunction with filtering in the time domain. This concept is applied to a time division (TD)-CDMA mobile radio system, which has been selected by ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) in January 1998 to form part of the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) air interface standard, and can be split up into a novel channel estimator and joint data detector which explicitly incorporate the information about the directions of arrival (DOAs) of signals emerging from users assigned to the considered BS. In this paper, the influence of the spatial separation of users assigned to the considered BS on the link level performance of a TD-CDMA mobile radio system is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations of data transmission in a single cell. Average bit error rates versus the average signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver input are presented for the uplink of a TD-CDMA mobile radio system in the rural propagation environment. The system performance is evaluated and compared for different scenarios of the user spatial separation and for two receiver structures, i.e., the conventional receiver, which does not use the information of the DOAs of user signals, and the enhanced receiver, which explicitly incorporates this knowledge.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.723811","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

The proposed detector's main feature lies in the joint utilization of the space and time processing techniques since adaptive antenna arrays and decorrelating multiuser receiver are supposed to be used together. Complexity growth is lowered by implementing a multiuser detection technique based on the sliding window algorithm. The DS-CDMA communication system considered resorts to QPSK modulated wideband signals so that a sliding window algorithm generalization is necessary. The simulation results shown here confirm that the proposed structure is near-far resistant even in the worst fading cases. As the sensor number increases a remarkable performance improvement takes place. Besides we show that the proposed receiver allows systems to exploit completely the array introduction while maintaining an acceptable computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

The considered system uses the same spectrum band in the system area. Assuming that there is a limited number of logical channels in the system, we can use an approach similar to a standard narrowband system and allocate channels to the cells using minimum interference distance parameter. Since there is only one carrier frequency used in the CDMA system a soft handover was proposed for higher communication quality and capacity. The call blocking probabilities versus different kinds of parameters are shown as a result of computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.723818","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

Fast power control tracks multipath fading perfectly which increases the intercell interference and thus reduces the capacity. If there is a line of sight (LOS) component between the mobile and the base station with which it is communicating, the fading will be of Rician type and less deep fades will be encountered which reduces the intercell interference. In this paper, we investigate the system capacity assuming the fading between a mobile and the base station with which it is communicating to be Rician with a Rician factor K while the fading between the same mobile and other base stations to be Rayleigh. We show a large increase in the capacity even for small Rician factors. A Rician fading is usually encountered when the mobile is close to the base station and thus the path-loss exponent can be less than four. Thus, we investigate the effect of changing the path-loss exponent value on the system capacity. Finally, we reduce the intercell interference by imposing a limit on the maximum increase in power to compensate for multipath fading and show how can this increase the capacity by more than 100%.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.723819","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

Known symbols are transmitted with a certain frequency together with the data symbols and are used by the receiver to extract a phase reference for demodulation. Different schemes for filtering of the known symbols to obtain the phase reference needed for demodulation are considered and BER comparisons are made. The BER of these SAD DS/CDMA schemes is also compared with that of fully coherent and differentially coherent DS/CDMA systems operating over Rician and Rayleigh fading channels. The important role of filtering in SAD for DS/CDMA networks is studied in detail and it is shown that under some channel and system conditions (such as terrestrial mobile with low data rates) optimum (Wiener) filtering is needed while for other channel and system conditions (such as GEO satellite with higher data rates) simpler low pass filters are sufficient.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.723821","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

The spreading code is designed in the frequency domain. Hence, the system is dual to a direct-sequence spread-system (DS-SS) where the spreading code is given in the time domain. Due to this dualism, first receiver designs for MC-SS used a frequency domain RAKE receiver. Further investigations focused on the properties of the time signal. It could be proved, that the time autocorrelation function for MC-SS signals is sufficiently good to permit the use of a RAKE receiver in the time domain. In this paper, we propose a MC-SS CDMA system with only one spreading code. Orthogonalization between the users could be achieved by adding a frequency offset to the main carrier frequency. The offset should be equal to the carrier spacing. In the case of ideal time and frequency synchronisation the multiple access interference (MAI) is apparent from the autocorrelation function of the code. Without perfect time and frequency synchronisation, a different kind of description of the code properties is required. We show that the evaluation of the ambiguity function of the MC-SS time signal is a way to describe the code properties in the time-frequency plane. This function could be used to estimate the strength and the form of MAI. We give equations for evaluation of the ambiguity function of a desired MC-SS code and demonstrate a way for MAI estimation. Finally, we give numerical results.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.723830","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

In a downlink signal processing, only the code of the mobile phone user is known, while the codes of the interfering users are unknown. In addition, the number of sources (users and paths) is usually larger than the code length. In this case, linear methods such as the matched filter fail to estimate the parameters. Blind source separation or independent component analysis is an approach offering the solution to this problem. We introduce blind source separation methods for estimating the symbols in an AWGN channel. The performance of the methods are based on the facts that the symbols have finite alphabet and/or are non-Gaussian. We present an algorithm which can estimate the parameters in an oversaturated system, i.e. when the number of binary signals can be larger than the code length. Simulations show that one can estimate the symbols without any knowledge of the chip sequences.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.723834","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

Suehiro (1993, 1994) proposed a 4-phase signal design for approximately synchronized CDMA systems without co-channel interference. In the proposed 4-phase signal design, each user is assigned a carrier frequency, some 4-phase sequence of finite length with pseudo-periodic property and comb-shaped spectrum, and a matched filter for the central large part of the assigned sequence. When the assigned sequence of the comb-shaped spectrum is modulated by the carrier the obtained signal has a comb-shaped spread spectrum. The carriers are assigned to each user so that any two of the users have an orthogonal comb-spectrum to each other. Because each user has a filter which is matched to the central part of the assigned sequence, no user receives co-channel interference near the main detection pulse under the condition of approximate synchronization. The Doppler effect and the multipath properties are simulated. When the carrier frequencies are about 2000 MHz, the signals works almost without co-channel interference under the Doppler shift at 1000 km/h. This result of simulation shows the usefulness of the 4-phase signal design without co-channel interference for an approximately synchronized uplink in cellular CDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.723836","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

The baseband receiver considered is the LMS-LMMSE receiver which includes the finite quantization of the incoming signal. Both AWGN channel and multipath channel models based on actual channel measurements are used in the computer simulations. Also the effect of imperfect power control on the signal quantization is considered. It is shown that the degradation in the performance of the receiver is relatively insignificant with practical levels of quantization.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.723842","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

All baseband functions like channel coding, modulation and equalisation are implemented in a general, parametrized way, so that all of them can be used for the selected standards. This structure has several advantages like a reduced size of the hardware platform, fast performance by changing the air interface for a system handover and the possibility of global roaming. The linear approximated GMSK is used in the SWRADIO because this enables a common I/Q-modulator for all second generation systems.

The stability of the proposed system is achieved through differential encoding of the data bits. It is demonstrated through simulations that the performance of the proposed decision directed receiver is better than that of an idealised receiver where channel estimation is not corrupted by decision feedback errors (e.g. by means of employing a pilot signal).

This problem can be alleviated by exploiting angular diversity. The aim of this work was to study a multibeam approach in the downlink. Both downlink and uplink simulations were carried out for channel models with flat and frequency selective fading. The co-channel interference was assumed as spatially and temporally white. The results show that when employing two transmitting beams the downlink performance improves by 4-8 dB at a bit error rate of 10/sup -2/ compared to the reference case of a single transmitting beam. It was also found that the more antennas the array has the more important is the downlink diversity scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.723855","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

We effectively have a single snapshot of 2D data and thus require 2D smoothing for extracting multiple snapshots. The comparative performance of two 2D smoothing schemes, pre-eigenanalysis and post-eigenanalysis to smoothing, is discussed. The space-time data model for the IS-95 uplink is presented. The performance of a reduced dimension space-time RAKE receiver for the IS-95 uplink using the AOA-delay estimates is assessed through Monte-Carlo simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

TD-CDMA makes use of all three basic multiple access schemes FDMA, TDMA and CDMA. It combines the advantages of these three schemes and seamlessly fits into the world of GSM. In contrast to DS (direct sequence)-CDMA without joint detection (JD), intracell interference is eliminated in the reception by using the a priori knowledge of the CDMA codes of the users of one and the same cell. This elimination is performed by a process termed joint detection and increases spectrum efficiency and capacity. In order to practically verify and to demonstrate the advantages of TD-CDMA, a TD-CDMA hardware demonstrator was implemented, which is suited for a real mobile radio environment. In the paper, first the basic features of the hardware demonstrator are described. Then, measurement results obtained with the hardware demonstrator are presented. Particular emphasis is spent on the critical issues of power control and timing advance control.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.723861","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

The standard version of the LMMSE receiver minimizes the mean squared error between the filter output and the true transmitted data sequence. Since the detector depends on the channel coefficients of all users, it cannot be implemented adaptively in fading channels due to severe convergence problems. In this paper, a modified criterion for deriving LMMSE receivers in fading channels is presented. The modified LMMSE receiver is independent from the users' complex channel coefficients. The performance of the LMMSE receivers in fading channels is studied via computer simulations and numerical analysis. The results show that the modified LMMSE receiver has remarkably larger capacity than the conventional RAKE receiver at the SNRs of practical interest.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified LMMSE receiver for DS-CDMA-Part I.

The wideband code-division multiple access (CDMA) concept FMA2; developed in the European FRAMES project supports variable data rate transmission. The data rate can be altered by changing either the spreading factor or by using multiple spreading codes in parallel. In order to facilitate flexible changing of the data rate, variable length orthogonal Walsh codes are used for channel separation, followed by a scrambling code. Optional short scrambling codes can be used if interference suppression is used. In this paper the downlink performance of the FMA2 system using both the conventional RAKE and the LMMSE-RAKE receivers is studied. According to the results, the performance of the conventional RAKE receivers is insufficient at lowest spreading factors, whereas the LMMSE-RAKE receiver performs well regardless of the spreading factor.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.723868","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

It is shown that in a single cell environment the bit error rate performance of the proposed receiver is similar to the conventional MF-ML receiver with known channel parameters. The advantages of the proposed MMSE-ML receiver over the MF-ML receiver are: (1) ability to perform joint synchronization, channel parameter estimation and signal detection where the signal is sent over unknown, slowly time varying frequency selective multipath fading channel, and (2) significantly improved performance in multicellular environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

The demand for wireless technology has been exploding. Several competing digital wireless access technologies including CT-2, DECT/CT-3, GSM, TDMA, and IS-95 CDMA have been used for providing the low tier and high-tier wireless services. This presentation focuses on the code division multiple access (CDMA) technology. Specifically it describes the following aspects of the CDMA technology: (a) background and fundamentals; (b) personal communication services and growth; (c) CDMA concepts and reception; (d) CDMA channel structures; (e) IS-95 radio link processes and signaling; (f) typical CDMA based system architecture and operations including call setup, call handoffs, call terminations and dynamic power control; and (g) roles of wideband CDMA technology in the third generation digital wireless communications and its applications in voice, data, and multimedia communications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON '98.

This review covers the application of expert systems, neural networks and fuzzy logic systems that can be integrated into each other and also with more traditional techniques to overcome specific problems. Usually a diagnostic procedure starts from a fault tree developed on the basis of the physical behaviour of the electrical system under consideration. In this phase the knowledge of well tested models able to simulate the electrical machine in different fault renditions is fundamental to obtain the patterns characterising the faults. Then the fault tree navigation performed by an expert system inference engine leads to the choice of suitable diagnostic indexes, referred to a particular fault, and relevant to build an input dataset for specific AI (neural networks, fuzzy logic or neuro-fuzzy) systems. The discussed methodologies, that play a general role in the diagnostic field, are applied to an induction machine, utilising as input signals the instantaneous voltages and currents. In addition, the supply converter is also considered to also incorporate in the diagnostic procedure the most typical failures of power electronic components. A brief description of the various techniques is provided, to highlight the advantages and the validity limits of using AI technologies. Some application examples are discussed and areas for future research are also indicated.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1998.724019","publicationTitle":"IECON '98.

To perform this task a coding strategy, inspired by the biological model of human vision, for pixel data is described. The coding strategy ensures that the input data is invariant against shift, scale and rotation of the object in the input domain. The image data is used as input to a class of self organizing neural networks, the Kohonen-maps or self-organizing feature maps (SOFM). To verify this approach two test sets have been generated: the first set, consisting of artificially generated images, is used to examine the classification properties of the SOFMs; the second test set examines the clustering capabilities of the SOFM when real world image data is applied to the network after it has been preprocessed to be invariant against shift, scale and rotation. It is shown that the clustering capability of the SOFM is strongly dependant on the invariance coding of the images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-4 Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/724032/","accessionNumber":"6142357","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A pixel based approach to view based object recognition with self-organizing neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pixel based approach to view based object recognition with self-organizing neural networks","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"00724032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07905S","chronDate":"31 Aug-4 Sep 1998","isNumber":"15649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5851","citationCount":"1","articleId":"724032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":724036,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Feature extraction is a well known approach to reduce the number of appearances of a three-dimensional object. Since features are derived from only a small part of the information comprised in the original image, it cannot be assumed that a given set of objects is separable in the reduced feature space. To avoid ambiguities, in general, multiple features have to be integrated in an object recognition system. Since feature extraction can be computationally intensive, a real-time system should evaluate features sequentially and terminate recognition when ambiguities are resolved. This paper gives an analysis of the clustering properties of ART 2A-E networks. It is shown how ART networks can be used to generate meaningful hints concerning the object's identity from ambiguous features by exploiting them up to an optimal degree.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1998.724036","startPage":"2063","endPage":"2068 vol.4","publicationTitle":"IECON '98.

The motor torque thus has ripples whose frequency are 1 and 6 times those of the primary frequency. In this paper, the authors propose an accurate speed controller in the lower speed region for a speed sensorless vector control system. In the system, the load torque is estimated by a disturbance observer and in order to extract the ripple of torque, they adopt the wavelet transform technique to the estimated torque.

When more than one power converter is operated at different frequencies greater than audible noise upper threshold, low frequency interharmonics are generated in common impedance due to nonlinear effects. Suppression of audible noise in multiple-coils induction cookers leads to high-performance fixed-frequency control. This paper presents a new unipolar voltage-cancellation control for series resonant inverters. This control strategy is used in full-bridge topologies for induction cookers, allowing fixed frequency control with ZVS operation over a wide power range. Performance of current-mode and voltage-cancellation is improved. This control is implemented in a series-resonant full-bridge inverter for induction cookers using IGBTs and digital control implemented in a PLD which can be easily implemented in an ASIC for mass production.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1998.724199","publicationTitle":"IECON '98.

This scheme uses an artificial neural network (ANN). The objective of this controller is to force the rotor speed to follow an arbitrarily prescribed trajectory. The proposed neural network structure is first trained to identify the inverse dynamics of the drive system. Then the trained neural network is used as a feedforward controller to generate both the input voltage and frequency for the motor to follow the desired trajectory. The training data is obtained from a laboratory setup which implements an LSI circuit (HEF4752V), a PWM inverter, and an induction motor. The main advantage of the proposed scheme is that it does not need a detailed and elaborate model of the drive system. The proposed system is capable of achieving accurate tracking control of the speed even when the nonlinear parameters of the motor and the load are unknown. These unknown nonlinear parameters are captured by the trained artificial neural network. The architecture and the training algorithm of the neural network are presented and discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed drive system is investigated using a laboratory model.

In both the methods, a sinewave diagnostic signal is injected into one of the inactive phases and the rotor position is inferred from the resulting modulated current signal. In the first method, the rotor position sensing is achieved only through hardware means. In the second method, which is introduced in this paper, the diagnostic signal is used to generate an index pulse which occurs every 30/spl deg/ (mech). The rotor position information is obtained at the intermediate positions using the index pulse in conjunction with internal timer available in the microcontroller in order to achieve high resolution. In this paper the position error, resolution, speed range and transient stability of the two methods are systematically analyzed using dynamic model of the 100 V, 500 W, 3000 RPM, 6/4 motor and their advantages and disadvantages are presented. Experimental results are presented in order to validate the two sensorless methods. The analysis results presented in this paper will be useful for the practical design of amplitude modulation based sensorless control schemes for SRM drives.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1998.724216","publicationTitle":"IECON '98.

If there is any change in the characteristics of these models, the system performance deteriorates. Therefore, it is expected that control systems must have robust stability. In this work, a modified robust model reference adaptive control scheme with a repetitive controller (RMRAC-RP) for uninterruptible power supply (UPS) applications is presented. In the proposed scheme, a voltage source PWM inverter and its corresponding RLC load-filter are controlled by RMRAC-RP in order to obtain a nearly sinusoidal output voltage for a single-phase UPS. The modified scheme guarantees that the closed-loop plant is globally stable in the presence of unmodeled dynamics and cyclic fluctuating loads. The proposed theoretical formulations are verified by system analysis and both simulated and experimental results are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"31 Aug-4 Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/724255/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"6142261","publicationDate":"1998","conferenceDate":"31 Aug.-4 Sept. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and implementation of a modified robust model reference adaptive control with repetitive controller for UPS applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and implementation of a modified robust model reference adaptive control with repetitive controller for UPS applications","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"00724255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044386S","chronDate":"31 Aug-4 Sep 1998","isNumber":"15620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5851","citationCount":"11","articleId":"724255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":724256,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Advantages include reduced line current harmonic distortion and unity power factor operation. Moreover, with the help of regenerative and resonant snubbers, a three-phase six-switches bridge configuration can now control high power levels (1.2 MVA) while operating at switching frequencies up to 1 kHz. In this range of power and switching frequencies, the switching pattern must be carefully chosen since it defines the supply current harmonic distortion which finally restricts the maximum attainable total input power factor. This paper proposes two space vector based modulating techniques for high power/low switching frequency applications (<1 kHz). The developed switching patterns feature similar performance (low harmonic distortion, minimum switching frequency, and instantaneous line current control) to that obtained with optimum off-line pattern generators (such as selective harmonic elimination). Moreover, they add the following features: (a) the selection of the switches to turn-on/off and the calculation of their on/off-times are done by solving linear algebraic equations, (b) there is no need for stored data since calculations can be implemented on-line, (c) the overmodulation region is naturally covered, including six-step operation, and (d) the short circuit pulses are generated automatically and distributed symmetrically through all the power switches, which enables an even sharing of the switching and conduction losses.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1998.724301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.1998.724301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15620","startPage":"542","endPage":"547 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON '98.

However, if real power must be delivered to the load, DC-link capacitors exhibit a problematic voltage unbalance, that can be faced in both active or passive ways, that is, by using or not using additional components. Both approaches can be used together, in order to optimize the system performances. The authors have analyzed this problem from an analytical point of view and have developed a modulation control strategy that exploits the inherent redundancy in switching configurations to achieve a correct voltage sharing, in the case of a MPCC with four DC-link capacitors.

The boost converter duty-cycle is generated by a PI controller based on the information supplied by the neural network.

The proposed novel instantaneous current sharing control scheme is based on the instantaneous output voltage control with the current deviation control and the instantaneous current deviation cancellation control utilizing the current share bus circuit. The proposed novel instantaneous current sharing control circuitry employs the share bus signal line interconnecting all the paralleled inverter on a noise insensitive line. The voltage control circuitry forces all the paralleled inverters to share load current, almost equally, by adjustment of the instantaneous reference voltage signal obtained from the current share bus. With the current share bus and the current deviation controller, the paralleled inverter with the highest output current becomes the master inverter; then all the other inverters become slave inverters. The instantaneous output current of the master inverter is subtracted from the other inverters' output currents, and the current deviations in each inverter module are calculated. Hereafter, the instantaneous current sharing controller forces the output current deviations of each inverter to be zero in every switching period. Furthermore, the output reference of the voltage controller is instantaneously to eliminate the unbalanced power. This results in superior power balance performance for parallel operation.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.1998.724306","publicationTitle":"IECON '98.

This modem was described by Scussel et al. (1997) at Oceans '97. A substantial number of modems have been constructed by Datasonics Inc., including some intended for deployment in the SEAWEB '98 series of acoustic experiments in September, 1998 in Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, in the USA. The purpose is to demonstrate an acoustic network capability supporting approximately 10 modems deployed in very shallow water. The network consists of two groups of modems, each using frequency partitioning of the approximately 5 kHz of available bandwidth, to communicate independently with a master modem. The master modem then acoustically communicates with a gateway containing both cellular and RF communications capabilities to reach distant users. Communications amongst the modems involves message transfer (\"hops\") across several modems, thus requiring careful attention to the development and implementation of network protocols. This is the first in a planned series of network experiments involving increasingly sophisticated modems and protocols, with autonomous handshaking and adaptive modulation offering both much lower and much higher data rates than are now available.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/724316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Sep-1 Oct 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6201763","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-1 Oct. 1998","displayDocTitle":"Underwater acoustic modem configured for use in a local area network (LAN)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater acoustic modem configured for use in a local area network (LAN)","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"00724316.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037973S","chronDate":"28 Sep-1 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877","citationCount":"4","articleId":"724316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":724318,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Dispersion of the propagating signal is governed by the inhomogeneous sound speed within the ocean, together with multipath reflections from the surface and from the sea bed. Additional fluctuations are imposed by the motion of the ocean itself; for example from tidal currents and internal waves. In order to represent all of these effects, a new model of acoustic propagation through the complex ocean environment has been developed. This is based on a 3D ray trace through a moving ocean, where the sound speed can display strong variation both with depth and in the horizontal plane. The ray tracer is extended to incorporate diffraction effects. The ray trace is particularly unusual in allowing dynamic transmitter and/or receiver geometry, with both platforms allowed to follow arbitrary trajectories. The modeling is deterministic, so that the results are reproducible and dominant factors contributing to the dispersion may be assessed. The model is used to examine the time varying channel transfer function and scattering function in a number of scenarios. Of particular interest is the case of a shallow water zone, where severe multipath conditions are encountered-around 20 distinct eigen-rays are found, many of which travel through the underlying sediment. The influence of this environment on the signal dispersion is examined.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1998.724318","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society. OCEANS'98.

This paper presents the fundamentals of this new technique and explains the differences between this method and conventional type imaging methods like video and sonar. 3D real time acoustical imaging is characterized by a number of important features like the ability to image a moving object, image presentation in a 3D environment, extraction of x,y,z coordinates, the possibility of adding virtual objects to the 3D scene as well as imaging in turbid water with practically zero visibility. 3D real time acoustics generate an \"acoustic movie\" with an update rate of between 2 and 10 images per second. Hence an object moving in any direction can be shown real time. All acoustic 3D data are known with respect to reflection intensity and x,y and z co-ordinates and can thus be shown in a 3D environment, i.e. the observer can change observation point in the 3D scene in order to acquire the best possible information. Moreover, knowledge of the 3D geometry allows for extraction of x,y,z co-ordinates for any pixel in the 3D image. Size and distance data are thus easy to obtain. The 3D presentation method allows for addition of virtual objects in the scene. The virtual objects can be described in VRML-format. The detection range of acoustical imaging systems extends to at least 100 metres, a range that exceeds the capabilities of any optical system. Also, even in near zero visibility environments, an acoustical system will generate images.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1998.724336","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society. OCEANS'98.

It is well known that the error probability of the usual linear modulations such as M-PSK over fading channels varies inversely with the signal-to-noise ratio.

Previous results indicate that performance may be greatly improved by adopting simple nonlinear receivers which have been commonly used in nonblind equalization. In this paper, a predictive decision-feedback structure that uses a super-exponential blind linear equalizer as a forward filter is analyzed. Its rapid convergence to an approximate Wiener solution allows near optimal mean-square performance to be attained with a relatively small number of input samples. The feedback filter is a linear predictor that can be efficiently adapted with the recursive least-squares algorithm. Using these design guidelines, the whole receiver becomes fast and self-tuning, in the sense that it does not require ad-hoc setting of critical convergence parameters. Experimental results using simulated and real data illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1998.724350","startPage":"810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society.

Latest developments indicate the feasibility of fully coherent, bandwidth efficient modulation schemes using single carrier modulation (SCM) techniques in conjunction with powerful time domain equalisation to provide reliable communications over such channels. Whilst proven statically, there are few reported results demonstrating the capability of this technology for high Doppler platforms in such environments. This paper considers the suitability of time domain adaptive equalisers for a shallow water, high Doppler environment. It is concluded that the time adaptive approach is constrained by the severe time spreads (hundreds of symbols) and differential Doppler temporal scaling experienced in the shallow water channel at high platform speeds. Under such circumstances spatially coherent processing is favoured as a means of containing the ray differential Doppler problem.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1998.724391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1998.724391","endPage":"1027 vol.2","publicationTitle":"IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society.

It thus involves coherent modulation transmission, and time-spatial equalization in reception. In order to evaluate which kind of receiver will best fit the objectives, an experiment was set up in September 1997. We recorded high signalling rates PSK in various shallow water areas.

Spread-spectrum communications are generally used if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. They fight against intersymbol interference (ISI) caused by the multipath propagation. This wide-band transmission is more robust against jamming (traffic noise) or fading problems than PSK communications. And they are particularly interesting in a multi-user environment. The long propagation delays in AUW channels preclude the use of time-division multiple-access (TDMA). Therefore, code-division multiple-access (CDMA) seems to be a very robust and efficient solution. In CDMA systems, a different spreading sequence is dedicated to each user. Due to hardware limitations and the number of users required, the length and size of the sequence families are often fixed. The classical families exist only for a few lengths and sizes. To design efficient systems, spreading sequences have to be chosen by minimizing a criterion on both even and odd correlation functions. The high complexity of the problem led us to use methods, derived from combinatorial optimization, which are described. These methods allow the design of variable length and size sequences. Their performance also exhibits better odd correlation properties than the classical families. Some sequences thus obtained are given. The inherent time-diversity of the CDMA may allow the overall performance to be increased. RAKE reception is discussed in an AUW medium. Spatial diversity was also tested and showed improvements using a small number of sensors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/724394/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28 Sep-1 Oct 1998","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1998","accessionNumber":"6201841","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 Sept.-1 Oct. 1998","displayDocTitle":"Spreading sequences for underwater multiple-access communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spreading sequences for underwater multiple-access communications","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"00724394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028784S","chronDate":"28 Sep-1 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5877","citationCount":"9","articleId":"724394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":724421,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Adaptive equalization is known to highly improve the communication data rate by mitigating intersymbol interference (ISI). Multichannel equalizers are known to further improve the communication by a proper combination of the signals received on a sparse array. The major issue is to select an efficient receiver configuration. There are several parameters that may affect the quality of communication. In this paper, we focus on the main features that influence the performance of adaptive multichannel equalizers, such as the number and positioning of hydrophones, the length of the equalizer, the adaptive algorithm used to update the equalizer's tap gains. The relationship between the multipath structure of the channel and the multichannel receiver's performance is exhibited.

It has been shown to be a promising technique for eliminating performance bottlenecks imposed by control flow in hardware and software implementations alike. In this paper, we present techniques to incorporate speculative execution in a fine-grained manner into scheduling of control-how intensive behavioral descriptions. We demonstrate that failing to take into account information such as resource constraints and branch probabilities can lead to significantly sub-optimal performance. We also demonstrate that it may be necessary to speculate simultaneously along multiple paths, subject to resource constraints, in order to minimize the delay overheads incurred when prediction errors occur. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that our speculative scheduling algorithm can result in significant (up to seven-fold) improvements in performance (measured in terms of the average number of clock cycles) as compared to scheduling without speculative execution. Also, the best and worst case execution times for the speculatively performed schedules are the same as or better than the corresponding values for the schedules obtained without speculative execution.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High level synthesis","Permission","Clocks","Laboratories","Processor scheduling","Data flow computing","Hardware","Software performance","Delay","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high level synthesis","data flow graphs","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speculative execution","scheduling","control-flow intensive behavioral descriptions","performance bottlenecks","fine-grained manner","sub-optimal performance","resource constraints","delay overheads","speculative scheduling algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=724449","doi":"10.1145/277044.277067","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

In conventional design, higher levels of synthesis produce a netlist, from which layout synthesis builds a mask specification for manufacturing. Timing analysis is built into a feedback loop to detect timing violations which are then used to update specifications to synthesis. Such iteration is undesirable, and for very high performance designs, infeasible. The problem is likely to become much worse with future generations of technology. To achieve a non-iterative design flow, we propose that early synthesis stages should use \"wireplanning\" to distribute delays over the functional elements and interconnect, and layout synthesis should use its degrees of freedom to realize those delays. In this paper we attempt to quantify this problem for future technologies and propose some solutions for a \"constant delay\" methodology.","doi":"10.1145/277044.277071","startPage":"122","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

Functional verification is necessarily incomplete because it is not computationally feasible to exhaustively simulate designs. It is important therefore to quantitatively measure the degree of verification coverage of the design. Coverage metrics proposed for measuring the extent of design verification provided by a set of functional simulation vectors should compute statement execution counts (controllability information), and check to see whether effects of possible errors activated by program stimuli can be observed at the circuit outputs (observability information). Unfortunately, the metrics proposed thus far, either do not compute both types of information, or are inefficient, i.e., the overhead of computing the metric is very large. In this paper, we provide the details of an efficient method to compute an Observability-based Code COverage Metric (OCCOM) that can be used while simulating complex HDL designs. This method offers a more accurate assessment of design verification coverage than line coverage, and is significantly more computationally efficient than prior efforts to assess observability Information because it breaks up the computation into two phases: Functional simulation of a modified HDL model, followed by analysis of a flowgraph extracted from the HDL model. Commercial HDL simulators can be directly used for the time-consuming first phase, and the second phase can be performed efficiently using concurrent evaluation techniques.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DAC.1998.724457","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1998.724457","startPage":"152","endPage":"157","pdfPath":"/iel4/5854/15604/00724457.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

We develop the design methodology for the low power core-based real-time system-on-chip based on dynamically variable voltage hardware. The key challenge is to develop effective scheduling techniques that treat voltage as a variable to be determined, in addition to the conventional task scheduling and allocation. Our synthesis technique also addresses the selection of the processor core and the determination of the instruction and data cache size and configuration so as to fully exploit dynamically variable voltage hardware, which result In significantly lower power consumption for a set of target applications than existing techniques. The highlight of the proposed approach is the non-preemptive scheduling heuristic which results in solutions very close to optimal ones for many test cases. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on a variety of modem industrial-strength multimedia and communication applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

In this paper we focus on the constraint of low energy dissipation, an indispensable peculiarity of embedded mobile computing systems. We present the first comprehensive framework that simultaneously evaluates the tradeoffs of energy dissipations of software and hardware such as caches and main memory. Unlike previous work in low power research which focused only on software or hardware, our framework optimizes system parameters to minimize energy dissipation of the overall system. The trade-off between system performance and energy dissipation is also explored. Experimental results show that our Avalanche framework can drastically reduce system energy dissipation.","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1998.724464","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

This paper describes and evaluates an approach for accelerating Boolean satisfiability using configurable hardware. Our approach harnesses the increasing speed and capacity of field-programmable gate arrays by tailoring the SAT-solver circuit to the particular formula being solved. This input-specific technique gets high performance due both to (i) a direct mapping of Boolean operations to logic gates, and (ii) large amounts of fine grain parallelism in the implication processing. Overall, these strategies yields impressive speedups (>200/spl times/ in many cases) compared to current software approaches, and they require only modest amounts of hardware. In a broader sense, this paper alerts the hardware design community to the increasing importance of input-specific designs, and documents their promise via a quantitative study of input-specific SAT solving.","doi":"10.1109/DAC.1998.724465","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

These systems can be designed in a cost efficient manner only if their architecture exploits the \"leads\" suggested by clever compile time performance estimators. However, performance estimation of networked embedded systems is a non-trivial problem. The computational requirements of such systems show statistical variations that stem from several interacting factors. At the slowest time scale, applications can adapt to network bandwidth by configuring the processing functionality of their task (e.g. compression parameters). Also, there could be significant execution time variations within a task. Thus it is tricky to compute the net processing demand of several such applications on a system architecture, especially if the system schedules these applications using prioritized run-time schedulers. In this paper we describe an analytical tool called AsaP for fast performance estimation of such embedded systems. AsaP builds approximate models of these systems and characterizes the processing load on the system as a stochastic process. The output of AsaP is an exact distribution of the processing delay of each application. This is a powerful result that can be leveraged for efficient design of multimedia networked systems requiring soft real-time guarantees. It is also the first known framework that quantifies the effect of runtime schedulers (FCFS, RM, EDF) on the performance of such systems.","doi":"10.1145/277044.277116","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

Among the considered objective functions are area, timing, congestion and heat distribution. The iterative nature of the algorithm assures that timing requirements are precisely met.

The global router addresses performance issues by utilizing recent results in high performance interconnect design, while still effectively minimizing global congestion. With experiments on the maze-routing component of our global router, we show that the choice of routing cost functions can have a significant impact on final solution quality. The results of a number of previously proposed routers may be improved dramatically by adopting the cost functions we suggest here. We also find little evidence of the \"net ordering problem\" when our cost functions and routing model are applied. The iterative deletion method is shown to improve global solution quality, particularly when high performance interconnect is required. We evaluate the performance of our global router by comparing the congestion of routes produced by our global router to those of a well known MCM router, V4R. Our global router, MINOTAUR, supports arbitrary numbers of routing layers, differing capacities for each layer, preexisting congestion and obstacles, and high performance interconnect structures (including those which require variable width interconnect).","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

AVIV optimizes for minimum code size. Retargetable code generation requires the development of heuristic algorithms for instruction selection, resource allocation, and scheduling. AVIV addresses these code generation subproblems concurrently, whereas most current code generation systems address them sequentially. It accomplishes this by converting the input application to a graphical (Split-Node DAG) representation that specifies all possible ways of implementing the application on the target processor. The information embedded in this representation is then used to set up a heuristic branch-and-bound step that performs functional unit assignment, operation grouping, register bank allocation, and scheduling concurrently. While detailed register allocation is carried out as a second step, estimates of register requirements are generated during the first step to ensure high quality of the final assembly code. We show that near-optimal code can be generated for basic blocks for different architectures within reasonable amounts of CPU time. Our framework thus allows us to accurately evaluate the performance of different architectures on application code.","doi":"10.1145/277044.277184","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

The HDL model describes interconnections of arithmetic, logic and memory modules. Given a path in the HDL model, the search for input stimuli that exercise the path can be converted into a standard satisfiability checking problem by expanding the arithmetic modules into logic-gates. However, this approach is not very efficient. We present a new HDL-satisfiability checking algorithm that works directly on the HDL model. The primary feature of our algorithm is a seamless integration of linear-programming techniques for feasibility checking of arithmetic equations that govern the behavior of datapath modules, and 3-SAT checking for logic equations that govern the behavior of control modules. This feature is critically important to efficiency, since it avoids module expansion and allows us to work with logic and arithmetic equations whose cardinality tracks the size of the HDL model. We describe the details of the HDL-satisfiability checking algorithm in this paper. Experimental results which show significant speedups over state-of-the-art gate-level satisfiability checking methods are included.","doi":"10.1145/277044.277187","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

Testing of embedded cores is achieved using the transparency properties of surrounding cores. At the core level, testability and transparency can be achieved by reusing existing logic inside the core, and providing different versions of the core having different area overheads and transparency latencies. At the chip level, the technique analyzes the topology of the SOC to select the core versions that best meet the user's desired test area overhead and test application time objectives. Application of the method to example SOCs demonstrates the ability to design highly testable SOCs with minimized test area overhead, minimized test application time, or a desired trade-off between the two. Significant reduction in area overhead and test application time compared to an existing SOC testing technique is also demonstrated.","doi":"10.1145/277044.277190","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

This long range sensitivity makes it difficult to balance delays in nets like clock trees, so for such nets inductance must be minimized. In this paper we use two- and three-dimensional electromagnetic field solvers to compare dedicated ground planes to a less area-consuming approach, interdigitating the signal line with ground lines. The surprising conclusion is that with very little area penalty, interdigitated ground lines are more effective at minimizing self-inductance than ground planes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layout techniques for minimizing on-chip interconnect self-inductance","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

However this is only the case when the shape of the positive and negative current pulses are closely matched. Moreover, as performance pressures increase, the peak current values are exceeding the range for which electromigration models are valid. Thus, during the design of TI's TMS320c6201 DSP chip, it was determined that limits needed to be placed on the current densities in signal-line segments, and that every net in the design should be checked. Dynamic current density analysis on all nets of a large design is computationally very expensive.

This paper presents the first polynomial-time optimal technology mapping algorithm, named HeteroMap, for delay minimization in heterogeneous FPGA designs. For a heterogeneous FPGA consisting of K/sub 1/-LUTs, K/sub 2/-LUTs, and K/sub c/-LUTs, HeteroMap computes the minimum delay mapping solution in O(/spl Sigma//sub i=1//sup c/K/sub i/.n.m.log n) time for a circuit netlist with n gates and m edges. The HeteroMap algorithm generates favorable results for Xilinx XC4000 series FPGAs and Lucent ORCA2C series FPGAs. Furthermore, the optimality of the HeteroMap algorithm enables us to quantitatively evaluate various heterogeneous architectures without the bias of mapping heuristics.","doi":"10.1145/277044.277221","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/277044.277221","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

For general networks, an effective strategy is to break it into trees and combine them. We also give an O(n/sup 3/) exact algorithm for combining the optimal solutions to these trees, under the condition that LUTs do not go across trees.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for functional multiple-output decomposition. We first address a compatible class encoding method to minimize the compatible classes in the image function. After the encoding algorithm is applied, the decomposability will be improved in the subsequent decomposition of the image function. The above encoding algorithm is then extended to encode multiple-output functions through the construction of a hyper-function. Common sub-expressions among these multiple-output functions can be extracted during the decomposition of the hyper-function. Therefore, we can handle the multiple-output decomposition in the same manner as the single-output decomposition. Experimental results show that our algorithms are very promising.","doi":"10.1145/277044.277223","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC. (Cat.

The main features of our approach are: Accurate exploitation of degrees of freedom, concurrent optimisation of multiple LUTs based on Boolean relations, and in-place re-programming without re-routing. Our tool optimizes the combinational component of the CLBs after layout, and does not require any re-wiring. Hence, delay and CLB usage are left unchanged, while power is minimized. As the algorithm operates locally on the various LUT clusters, it best performs on large examples as demonstrated by our experimental results: An average power reduction of 20.6% has been obtained on standard benchmarks.","doi":"10.1145/277044.277224","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

The rapid increase in the complexity and speed of each new CPU generation is outstripping the benefits of voltage reduction and feature size scaling. Designers are thus continuously challenged to come up with innovative ways to reduce power, while trying to meet all the other constraints imposed on the design. This paper presents an overview of the issues related to power consumption in the context of Intel CPUs. The main trends that are driving the increased focus on design for low power are described. System and benchmarking issues, and sources of power consumption in a high-performance CPU are briefly described. Techniques that have been tried on real designs in the past are described. The role of CAD tools and their limitations in this domain are also discussed. In addition, areas that need increased research focus in the future are also pointed out.","doi":"10.1145/277044.277227","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

Their embodiments, from software and HDL program down to device-level netlist and mask data, represent carefully guarded intellectual property (IP). Hence, design methodologies based on IP reuse require new mechanisms to protect the rights of IP producers and owners. This paper establishes principles of watermarking-based IP protection, where a watermark is a mechanism for identification that is (i) nearly invisible to human and machine inspection, (ii) difficult to remove, and (iii) permanently embedded as an integral part of the design. We survey related work in cryptography and design methodology, then develop desiderata, metrics and example approaches-centering on constraint-based techniques-for watermarking at various stages of the VLSI design process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/724576/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6091442","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 1998","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Watermarking techniques for intellectual property protection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Watermarking techniques for intellectual property protection","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00724576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077914S","chronDate":"15-19 June 1998","isNumber":"15604","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5854","citationCount":"92","articleId":"724576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":724577,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.

On several industrial test cases, we obtain extremely strong, tamper-resistant proofs of authorship for placement and routing solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust IP watermarking methodologies for physical design","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 Design and Automation Conference. 35th DAC.

We use this observation to automatically determine the dimension of the subspace required to represent an image with a guaranteed user-specified accuracy, as well as to quickly compute a basis for the subspace.

Usual planners compute paths made of circular arcs tangentially connected by line segments, as these paths are locally optimal. The drawback of these paths is that their curvature profile is not continuous: to follow them precisely, a vehicle must stop and reorient its directing wheels at each curvature discontinuity (transition segment-circle). To remove this limitation, a new path planning problem is proposed: two curvature constraints are added to the classical kinematic constraints taken into account. Thus, the curvature must remain continuous, and its derivative is bounded (as the car-like robot can reorient its directing wheels with a limited speed only). For this problem, the existence of solutions and the characterization of those of optimal length are shown. A method solving the forward-only problem (i.e. the problem for a car moving only forward) is then presented, and this method is compared to the classical one w.r.t. the complexity and computation time, the length of the generated paths and the quality of the tracking.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1998.724591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15657","startPage":"25","endPage":"31 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

We use the Hamilton-Jacobi framework to create a continuously differentiable interpolation of an existing path of straight lines and arcs of circles. The smoothing approach is combined with the generation of an appropriate velocity profile along the path. The results are compared to those obtained by more classical smoothing methods and to the polynominal approach implemented on the car-like robot MoViLaR of our institute.

For dynamic walking on irregular terrain, we employ a control system involving a neural oscillator network, a stretch reflex and a flexor reflex. Stable dynamic walking when obstructions to swinging legs are present is made possible by the flexor reflex and the crossed extension reflex. A modification of the single driving input to the neural oscillator network makes it possible for the robot to walk up a step. For running on flat terrain, we combine a spring mechanism and the neural oscillator network. It became clear in this study that the matching of two oscillations by the spring-mass system and the neural oscillator network is important in enabling the robot to hop. The present study also shows that entrainment between neural oscillators causes the running gait to change from hopping to bouncing. This finding renders running fairly easy to attain in a bounce gait. It must be noticed that the flexible and robust dynamic walking on irregular terrain and the transition of the running gait are realized by the modification of a few parameters in the neural oscillator network.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1998.724595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15657","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

The adaptive control mechanism is designed in a virtual space utilizing the virtual model control paradigm. The neural network is parameterized and trained in an unsupervised learning mode. There are two advantages to this approach. First, the NNAC can identify the unmodelled dynamics of the robot and ensure asymptotic system stability in a Lyapunov sense. Second, the controller can better accommodate unexpected external disturbances.

To guarantee the boundedness of the states, joint PD control is introduced in the system. The method can be considered both as an online identifier that can be used as a basis for designing neural network controllers as well as an off-line learning scheme to compute deflections due to link flexibility for evaluating forward dynamics. The performance of the proposed neural identifier is evaluated by identifying the dynamics of different flexible-link manipulators.

For long-channel devices formed by conventional processing, both are routinely predicted by a combination of process and device simulation to better than 0.1 V [2]. For short-channel devices, particularly those formed with a very small thermal budget, anomalous diffusion effects can strongly influence the final doping profile and lead to incorrect threshold predictions. We report here on short (0.45/spl mu/m coded) and long (2/spl mu/m) channel length devices which show threshold shifts which are not predicted by conventional diffusion models. It is shown that transient enhanced diffusion caused by the source-drain implant must be influencing the channel profile. If the point defects generated by the source-drain implant are taken into account in the diffusion simulation, an accurate channel profile is obtained. Using correct diffusion profiles, the experimental threshold behavior is reproduced in device simulation.","doi":"10.1109/VPAD.1993.724763","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1993 International Workshop on VLSI Process and Device Modeling (1993 VPAD)","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1993 International Workshop on VLSI Process and Device Modeling (1993 VPAD)","pdfPath":"/iel4/5880/15664/00724763.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VPAD.1993.724763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15664","startPage":"148","endPage":"149","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00724763.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous Short-channel Body Coefficients Due To Transient Enhanced Diffusion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=724763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous Short-channel Body Coefficients Due To Transient Enhanced Diffusion","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 May 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/724763/","conferenceDate":"14-15 May 1993","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous Short-channel Body Coefficients Due To Transient Enhanced Diffusion","confLoc":"Nara, Japan","sourcePdf":"00724763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035602S","chronDate":"14-15 May 1993","isNumber":"15664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5880","citationCount":"1","articleId":"724763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":724821,"authors":[{"name":"Kuk Won Ko","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kuk Won Ko","id":"37087164674"},{"name":"Hyung Suck Cho","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyung Suck Cho","id":"37087165930"},{"name":"Jong Hyung Kim","affiliation":["Vision Research Gr., FA research Institute, Production Engineering Center, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong Hyung Kim","id":"37087629445"},{"name":"Jae Son Kim","affiliation":["Vision Research Gr., FA research Institute, Production Engineering Center, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jae Son Kim","id":"37087628399"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4465-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"724821","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=724821","abstract":"In this paper, we described an approach to automation of visual inspection of solder joint defects of SMC (surface mounted components) on PCB (printed circuit board) by using neural network and fuzzy rule-based classification method. Inherently, the surface of the solder joints is curved, tiny and specular reflective; it induces a difficulty of taking good image of the solder joints. The shape of the solder joints tends to vary greatly with soldering condition and the shapes are not identical to each other, even for solder joints belonging to a set of the same soldering quality. This problem makes it difficult to classify the solder joints according to their qualities. Neural network and fuzzy rule-based classification method is proposed to efficiently make human-like classification criteria of the solder joint shapes. The performance of the proposed approach is tested on numerous samples of commercial computer PCB boards and compared with the human inspector's performance.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1998.724821","startPage":"1565","endPage":"1570 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

The goal of the task is to find a path that links a lying state to an upright state under the constraints of the system dynamics. The geometry of the robot is such that there is no static solution; the robot has to stand up dynamically utilizing the momentum of its body. We use reinforcement learning, in particular, a continuous time and state temporal difference (TD) learning method.

Visually based teleoperation systems heretofore described in the literature unfortunately can only display an instantaneous representation of the control sequence. Past control experience should instead be accumulated and available to facilitate teleoperators. In this paper, the behavior sampling extraction theory and method, the behavior sampling data representation, and portions of the status on demand function-set are introduced. Behavior sampling utilizes semiotic analysis of the teleoperator control behavior to syntactically segment the control motions and the relevant visual objects into a syntactically indexable storage stream. A preliminary system used for manipulating single biological cells under an optical microscope (fitted with a video camera) is described. Repetitive manipulation experiments on Mato fluorescent granular perithelial (FGP) cells show the effectiveness of this enhancement to the visually based control approach.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Control systems","Teleoperators","Motion control","Optical microscopy","Displays","Data mining","Motion analysis","Streaming media","Biological cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telerobotics","micromanipulators","video signal processing","image segmentation","CCD image sensors","motion control","laboratory techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recording mechanism","visually based teleoperation","syntactically indexed playback","behavior sampling data representation","semiotic analysis","optical microscope","Mato fluorescent granular perithelial cells"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IROS.1998.724851","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

This approach is promising for applications in robot vision and visual inspection. Some early vision-like processing algorithms, such as edge-detection, smoothing and thinning, are installed in the vision systems. However, they are not sufficient for applications because their output is in the form of pattern information, so that, in order to respond to input, some feature values are required to be extracted from the pattern. We propose a method for extracting feature values associated with images in a massively parallel vision system. The feature can be a complex one, such as the rotation angle of an object, if the feature value changes continuously as the image changes. The method is based on the eigenspace method, but modified to be robust. In addition, we propose some computation accelerating methods and report some experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1998.724857","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

Then, by taking advantages of fuzzy systems and neural networks a novel fuzzy-neural network with a general parameter learning algorithm and system structure determination is developed. The general parameter method (GP) is based on GMDH (group methods of data handling). The GP is used for a learning algorithm and the structure determination of the developed fuzzy neural network. The GP is extended to an adaptive genetic algorithm for explanation. The resulting network can easily be implemented with a Hitachi RISK+DSP microprocessor and is fast enough for real time operations.

The control scheme consists of a gain tuning neural network and a variable-gain PID controller. This neural network is trained to reduce the error between the plant output and reference signal to zero. In the process, the neural network learns the optimal gain of the PID controller. The flexible microactuator is made of a bimorph piezoelectric high-polymer material (PVDF). The bimorph piezoelectric microactuator consists of two PVDF films cemented with a metal shim in proper polarity.

We explore extensions of this service to achieve fine-grained statistical multiplexing with different virtual circuits time sharing the wavelengths in a fair manner. We develop a very fast, best effort time-slotted WDM network protocol with very good fairness and throughput characteristics. As an additional design feature, our protocol supports the assignment of guaranteed bandwidths (GBW) to selected sessions. This feature acts as a first step toward supporting integrated services at the optical layer in WDM networks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WDM networks","Wavelength division multiplexing","Protocols","Switching circuits","Telecommunication traffic","All-optical networks","Local area networks","Circuit testing","Time sharing computer systems","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelength division multiplexing","optical fibre LAN","metropolitan area networks","access protocols","multi-access systems","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["best-effort services","WDM networks","fair access","minimum bandwidth guarantee","wavelength-division multiplexing","circuit switching","data applications","bursty traffic patterns","All-Optical Network Consortium","all-optical LAN/MAN test bed","time-slotted WDM service","fine-grained statistical multiplexing","virtual circuits","time sharing","time-slotted WDM network protocol","max-min fairness","throughput","integrated services","optical layer","multiaccess protocol","wavelength routed network"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.725175","startPage":"1024","endPage":"1039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/15642/00725175.pdf","doi":"10.1109/49.725175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward best-effort services over WDM networks with fair access and minimum bandwidth guarantee","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Toward best-effort services over WDM networks with fair access and minimum bandwidth guarantee","accessionNumber":"6071834","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","volume":"16","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/725175/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward best-effort services over WDM networks with fair access and minimum bandwidth guarantee","sourcePdf":"00725175.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037968S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"23","articleId":"725175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":725178,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This paper presents results obtained in the following domains covered within the project: network topology considerations (optimization and dimensioning); network physical layer simulation; fabrications of packaged functional modules based on advanced optoelectronic devices; laboratory demonstrations of N/spl times/10 Gb/s transmission and routing; feasibility of an optical time division multiplexing/WDM (OTDM/WDM) interface; and the field implementation of a 4/spl times/4 multiwavelength crossconnect prototype, featuring all-optical space and wavelength routing. This implementation was realized in two cross-border field trials, one conducted between Norway and Denmark and the other between France and Belgium. The final results of the Norway to Denmark field trials are presented, featuring the successful cascade of three wavelength-translating optical crossconnects (OXCs), along with the transmission over 1000 km of a mix of standard/submarine cable links for four channels at 2.5 Gb/s.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward wide-scale all-optical transparent networking: the ACTS optical pan-European network (OPEN) project","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.725192","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/15642/00725192.pdf","startPage":"1226","endPage":"1244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.725192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15642","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=725192","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/725192/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Toward wide-scale all-optical transparent networking: the ACTS optical pan-European network (OPEN) project","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6071851","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward wide-scale all-optical transparent networking: the ACTS optical pan-European network (OPEN) project","sourcePdf":"00725192.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091387S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"32","articleId":"725192","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":725193,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The MOSAIC network implements the optical layer protocol to support bit-rate transparent multichannel lightpaths. Two types of add/drop multiplexers are implemented and combined in a three-node experiment. Multihop lightpaths are established giving an end-to-end bit error rate of better than 10/sup -9/ at 1.2 Gbps. The reconfigurable add/drop multiplexer is based on a novel dilated 2/spl times/2 acoustooptic filter switch crossconnect and an analog optoelectronic crossconnect that drives a ten-wavelength laser array transmitter up to 2.5 Gbps per wavelength. The fixed wavelength add/drop multiplexer utilizes a fast digitally tunable laser transmitter. Both add/drop multiplexers support bit-rate transparent 2R optoelectronic regeneration as well as wavelength translation. Subcarrier multiplexing on each wavelength is used to support channel state monitoring and channel equalization as well as transmission of digital network control information. Systems experiments demonstrate cascaded 2R optoelectronic regeneration with wavelength translation and cascaded multichannel optical switching with up to seven hops. It is shown that combining cascaded 2R optoelectronic regeneration with cascaded multichannel optical switching can be used to balance jitter accumulation and amplified spontaneous emission generated amplitude noise to yield high signal-to-noise ratio for lightpaths.","doi":"10.1109/49.725195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.725195","endPage":"1285","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/15642/00725195.pdf","startPage":"1270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MOSAIC: a multiwavelength optical subcarrier multiplexed controlled network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/725195/","displayDocTitle":"MOSAIC: a multiwavelength optical subcarrier multiplexed controlled network","volume":"16","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"6071854","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOSAIC: a multiwavelength optical subcarrier multiplexed controlled network","sourcePdf":"00725195.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066841S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"12","articleId":"725195","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":725198,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Here, these concepts are extended to network implementation by introducing an optical code division multiplexing (OCDM) multihop strategy using optical coding. It is shown that this approach is effective in scaling up existing wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks without a significant drain of the wavelength resources. The concept of a virtual optical code path (VOCP) is introduced within the transport layer of the network. It is demonstrated that this is a potential solution to wavelength path (WP) allocation problems which may plague WDM based transport networks of the future. Crucial to the VOCP concept is optical code conversion. The interplay between this added functionality and the optical cross-connect is highlighted; the optical cross-connect serves to establish VOCP/VWP (virtual wavelength path) in the hybrid transport layer. An example of optical code conversion is introduced. It is based on coherent OCDM principles in which bipolar phase-shift keyed (PSK) optical pulse sequences are used as the signature codes. Error-free code conversion using a four-chip optical encoder/decoder is successfully performed at 1.24 Gbit/s. The results show the feasibility of high bit rate OCDM transmission with optical code conversion.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=725198","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Code division multiplexing","Optical fiber networks","Wavelength division multiplexing","WDM networks","Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Phase shift keying","Optical pulses","Decoding","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","wavelength division multiplexing","optical fibre networks","codes","phase shift keying","code convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiplexing lightwave networks","code division multiple access techniques","network implementation","OCDM multihop strategy","scaling","wavelength division multiplexing networks","WDM networks","wavelength resource","virtual optical code path","VOCP","transport layer","wavelength path allocation problems","WP allocation problems","optical code conversion","functionality","optical cross-connect","VOCP/VWP","virtual wavelength path","bipolar phase-shift keyed optical pulse sequences","signature codes","error-free code conversion","four-chip optical encoder/decoder","high bit rate OCDM transmission","1.24 Gbit/s"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/15642/00725198.pdf","startPage":"1309","endPage":"1319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.725198","doi":"10.1109/49.725198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code division multiplexing lightwave networks based upon optical code conversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/725198/","displayDocTitle":"Code division multiplexing lightwave networks based upon optical code conversion","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6071857","volume":"16","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code division multiplexing lightwave networks based upon optical code conversion","sourcePdf":"00725198.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049016S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"78","articleId":"725198","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":725200,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

They are the ideal technology for building light-path switches to configure wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) transmission facilities. This technology, however, has a major constraint: crosstalk. Design of a strictly nonblocking directional coupler-based photonic switching system under a specified crosstalk constraint has previously been studied. The results indicate that a lower level of crosstalk can be achieved at a cost of some extra amount of hardware. In this paper, we show that if a simple rule is followed in setting up the connections, both the amount of hardware for nonblocking networks and the connection setup time can be greatly reduced. The resulting networks thus belong to the class of wide-sense nonblocking networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/49/15642/00725200.pdf","startPage":"1327","endPage":"1332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/49.725200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.725200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15642","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=725200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-sense nonblocking Banyan-type switching systems based on directional couplers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switching systems","Directional couplers","Crosstalk","Switches","Wavelength division multiplexing","Hardware","Telecommunication switching","Electrodes","Optical coupling","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical directional couplers","wavelength division multiplexing","optical crosstalk","photonic switching systems","multistage interconnection networks","optical fibre networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide-sense nonblocking Banyan-type switching systems","directional couplers","light-path switches","wavelength division multiplexing","WDM transmission facilities","crosstalk","photonic switching system","connection setup time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/725200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","displayDocTitle":"Wide-sense nonblocking Banyan-type switching systems based on directional couplers","volume":"16","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6071859","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-sense nonblocking Banyan-type switching systems based on directional couplers","sourcePdf":"00725200.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027702S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"49","articleId":"725200","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":725202,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The die attach resistance often differs substantially from the value predicted using the bulk thermal conductivity of the attachment material because of partial voiding and delamination. These defects can be introduced during the attachment process or during subsequent exposure to humidity or temperature fluctuations. This manuscript develops a technique for precisely measuring the spatially-averaged die-attach thermal resistance and for mapping spatial variations of the resistance in the plane of the die. The spatially-averaged resistance measurements use transient electrical heating and thermometry at frequencies up to 1 kHz to achieve a value of the uncertainty near 10/sup -6/ m/sup 2/K/W, which is a substantial improvement over existing steady-state methods. Spatial variations are captured using scanning laser-reflectance thermometry and a deconvolution method detailed here. The data in this manuscript show the impact of the adhesive material, the adhesive thickness, and the attachment pressure on the thermal resistance, as well as the spatial variation of the resistance resulting from incomplete contact.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/725215/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1998","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6070890","volume":"21","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Precision measurement and mapping of die-attach thermal resistance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precision measurement and mapping of die-attach thermal resistance","sourcePdf":"00725215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024452S","chronDate":"Sep 1998","isNumber":"15633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"95","citationCount":"37","articleId":"725215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":725218,"authors":[{"name":"O.G.

However, most of the classical non-Gaussian receiver design techniques cannot be extended to the symmetric /spl alpha/-stable noise case since these techniques require an explicit compact analytical form for the probability density function (PDF) of the noise distribution which /spl alpha/-stable distributions do not possess. A new analytical representation has been suggested for the symmetric /spl alpha/-stable PDF which is based on scale mixtures of Gaussians. Based on this new analytical representation, this paper introduces a novel near-optimal receiver for the detection of signals in symmetric /spl alpha/-stable noise.

The new technology enables parallel transmission and simultaneous access of 2-D images in a multiple-access environment. However, previous work on OOSPCs assumed that the weight of every signature pattern in a code set was the same. In this paper, we construct and analyze a new family of OOSPCs without this assumption.

Their existence can convert a range-independent sound propagation problem into a range-dependent one. Measurements show that strong changes in sound speed and attenuation are produced by the presence of swarms of microbubbles which can be depicted as patchy clouds superimposed on a very weak background layer. While models suitable for use in acoustic calculations are available for the homogeneous bubble layer (which results from long time averages of the total bubble population), no similar parameterizations are available for the more realistic inhomogeneous bubble layer. Based on available information and within the framework of a classification scheme for bubble plumes proposed by Monahan, a model for the range and depth dependence of the bubbly environment is developed to fill this void. This model, which generates a possible realization of the bubbly environment, is then used to calculate the frequency-dependent change in the sound speed and attenuation induced by the presence of the bubble plumes. Time evolution is not addressed in this work.","doi":"10.1109/48.725236","startPage":"423","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/48/15634/00725236.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.725236","endPage":"438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model for variations in the range and depth dependence of the sound speed and attenuation induced by bubble clouds under wind-driven sea surfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/725236/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"A model for variations in the range and depth dependence of the sound speed and attenuation induced by bubble clouds under wind-driven sea surfaces","volume":"23","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6072798","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model for variations in the range and depth dependence of the sound speed and attenuation induced by bubble clouds under wind-driven sea surfaces","sourcePdf":"00725236.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04325S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15634","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"34","articleId":"725236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":725242,"authors":[{"name":"K.F.

The correct interpretation of NC can be based on the analysis of the time-domain transient current in response to a small voltage step or impulse, involving a self-consistent treatment of all relevant physical effects (carrier transport, injection, recharging, etc.). NC appears in the case of the nonmonotonic or positive-valued behavior of the time-derivative of the transient current in response to a small voltage step. The time-domain transient current approach is illustrated by simulation results and experimental studies of quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs). The NC effect in QWIPs has been predicted theoretically and confirmed experimentally. The huge NC phenomenon in QWIP's is due to the nonequilibrium transient injection from the emitter caused by the properties of the injection barrier and the inertia of the QW recharging.","doi":"10.1109/16.725254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15637","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.725254","endPage":"2206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel4/16/15637/00725254.pdf","startPage":"2196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Negative capacitance effect in semiconductor devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/725254/","displayDocTitle":"Negative capacitance effect in semiconductor devices","volume":"45","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"6057851","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Negative capacitance effect in semiconductor devices","sourcePdf":"00725254.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055021S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15637","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"229","articleId":"725254","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":725260,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Li Chen","affiliation":["Advanced Semiconductor Device Research Laboratory and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsin-Li Chen","id":"37293463400"},{"name":"Ching-Yuan Wu","affiliation":["Advanced Semiconductor Device Research Laboratory and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Yuan Wu","id":"37334386500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"725260","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":509},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analytical grain-barrier height model and its characterization for intrinsic poly-Si thin-film transistor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=725260","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Thin film transistors","Threshold voltage","Equations","Grain size","Active matrix liquid crystal displays","Grain boundaries","Random access memory","Nonvolatile memory","Electrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["silicon","elemental semiconductors","thin film transistors","semiconductor device models","grain size","MISFET"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytical model","grain-barrier height model","characterization","intrinsic poly-Si TFT","thin-film transistor","applied gate voltage","charge neutrality equation","quasi-two-dimensional method","polysilicon TFT","Si"]}],"doi":"10.1109/16.725260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel4/16/15637/00725260.pdf","startPage":"2245","endPage":"2247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.725260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15637","abstract":"An analytical model for the grain-barrier height of the intrinsic poly-Si thin-film transistors (TFTs) is developed, in which the grain-barrier height for the applied gate voltage smaller than the threshold voltage is obtained by solving the charge neutrality equation and the grain-barrier height for the applied gate voltage larger than the threshold voltage is obtained by using the quasi-two-dimensional (2-D) method.

Attention is limited to partition-extrapolation procedures in which the Sommerfeld integral is evaluated as a sum of a series of partial integrals over finite subintervals and is accelerated by an extrapolation method applied over the real-axis tail segment (/spl alpha/,/spl infin/) of the integration path, where /spl alpha/>0 is selected to ensure that the integrand is well behaved. An analytical form of the asymptotic truncation error (or the remainder), which characterizes the convergence properties of the sequence of partial sums and serves as a basis for some of the most efficient extrapolation methods, is derived. Several extrapolation algorithms deemed to be the most suitable for the Sommerfeld integrals are described and their performance is compared. It is demonstrated that the performance of these methods is strongly affected by the horizontal displacement of the source and field points /spl rho/ and by the choice of the subinterval break points. Furthermore, it is found that some well-known extrapolation techniques may fail for a number of values of /spl rho/ and ways to remedy this are suggested.

Electromagnetic (EM) sensors (ground-penetrating radars) use signals at radio and microwave frequencies for this purpose. In the past, EM sensors for land-mine detection have been empirically developed and optimized. This has involved experimental tests that are complicated, time consuming, and expensive. An alternative is to carry out initial development and optimization using accurate numerical simulations. One objective of this paper is to show, for the first time, that such simulations can be done using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The separated-aperture sensor has been under investigation by the United States Army for land-mine detection for many years. It consists of two parallel dipole antennas housed in corner reflectors that are separated by a metallic septum. It is a continuous-wave sensor tuned to a particular frequency (typically 790 MHz). When the sensor is over empty ground, the coupling between the antennas is very small. As the sensor is moved over a buried mine, the coupling between the antennas increases indicating the presence of the mine. In this paper, the complete EM system composed of the separated-aperture sensor, air and soil, and buried land mine is modeled using the FDTD method. The finite computational volume is truncated with an absorbing boundary condition: the generalized perfectly matched layer. Detailed studies made with the simulation increase the understanding of this sensor. Results computed from the simulation are in good agreement with experimental measurements.","doi":"10.1109/8.725272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/15639/00725272.pdf","startPage":"1419","endPage":"1426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.725272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A complete electromagnetic simulation of the separated-aperture sensor for detecting buried land mines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=725272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/725272/","displayDocTitle":"A complete electromagnetic simulation of the separated-aperture sensor for detecting buried land mines","volume":"46","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6072588","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A complete electromagnetic simulation of the separated-aperture sensor for detecting buried land mines","sourcePdf":"00725272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034217S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"58","articleId":"725272","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":725274,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The idea is to extend the electromagnetic field inside the PEC and to introduce a new unknown, the surface electric current density to ensure the vanishing of the tangential components of the electric field on the boundary of the PEC. This requires the use of two independent meshes: a regular three-dimensional (3-D) cubic lattice for the electromagnetic field and a triangular surface-patching for the surface electric current density. The intersection of these two meshes gives a simple coupling law between the electric field and the surface electric current density. An interesting property of this method is that it provides the surface electric current density at each time step. Furthermore, this method looks like FDTD with a special model for the PEC.

Accounting for about 0.45 dB due to the outer codes, sequential decoding takes place at about 1.7 dB below the SNR cutoff rate for the convolutional code. This is possible since the iteration process provides the sequential decoders with side information that allows a smaller average load and minimizes the probability of computational overflow.

Our optimality criterion is to minimize the average end-to-end distortion. For a given channel SNR and transmission rate, our joint source and channel code designs achieve an optimal allocation of bits between the source and channel coders. Our three techniques include a source-optimized channel code, a channel-optimized source code, and an iterative descent technique combining the design strategies of the other two codes. The joint designs use channel-optimized vector quantization (COVQ) for the source code and rate compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) coding for the channel code. The optimal bit allocation reduces distortion by up to 6 dB over suboptimal allocations and by up to 4 dB relative to standard COVQ for the source data set considered. We find that all three code designs have roughly the same performance when their bit allocations are optimized. This result follows from the fact that at the optimal bit allocation the channel code removes most of the channel errors, in which case the three design techniques are roughly equivalent. We also compare the robustness of the three techniques to channel mismatch.

The minimum variance distortionless response beamformer maximizes the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) when it is employed in the receiver of a wireless link. In a system with omnidirectional antennas, power control algorithms are used to maximize the SINR as well. We consider a system with beamforming capabilities in the receiver, and power control. An iterative algorithm is proposed to jointly update the transmission powers and the beamformer weights so that it converges to the jointly optimal beamforming and transmission power vector. The algorithm is distributed and uses only local interference measurements. In an uplink transmission scenario, it is shown how base assignment can be incorporated in addition to beamforming and power control, such that a globally optimum solution is obtained. The network capacity and the saving in mobile power are evaluated through numerical study.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/725309/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1998","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6072753","volume":"46","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint optimal power control and beamforming in wireless networks using antenna arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint optimal power control and beamforming in wireless networks using antenna arrays","sourcePdf":"00725309.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059142S","chronDate":"Oct.  1998","isNumber":"15640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"365","articleId":"725309","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":725312,"authors":[{"name":"B.R.

It is shown that when either a conventional single user receiver or the RAKE receiver is employed, both multiple access and intersymbol interference can be eliminated by means of a suitable transmitter precoding scheme. Transmitter precoding represents a linear transformation of transmitted signals, such that the mean squared errors at all receivers are minimized. Precoding, with both conventional single user receiver and with the RAKE receiver, results in near-far resistant performance and outperforms considerably the respective schemes without precoding.

The performances of this improved receiver and the CMMSE receiver are compared in terms of the mean squared error (MSE), probability of error, and asymptotic multiuser efficiency (AME). As the original definition of AME does not consider mismatched channels, the behavior of three single-user receivers bearing imperfect delay estimation is also investigated. These single-user receivers are employed to define a more appropriate AME.

The discriminative training implemented for the trended HMM has the potential to utilize this new, constrained model space, thereby providing stronger power to disambiguate the observational trajectories generated from nonstationary sources corresponding to different speech classes.

A maximum likelihood state-based additive bias compensation algorithm is developed for the continuous density hidden Markov model (CDHMM). Based on this technique, specific bias models in the mel cepstral and the linear spectral domains are presented. Among these models, a new polynomial trend bias model in the mel cepstral domain is derived, which proved effective for Lombard speech compensation. In addition, a joint estimation algorithm for additive and convolutive bias compensation is proposed. This algorithm is based on applying the expectation maximization (EM) technique in both above-mentioned domains, in conjunction with a parallel model combination (PMC) based transformation. The compensation of the dynamic (difference) coefficients in the proposed framework is also studied. The evaluation data base consists of a 21 confusable word vocabulary uttered by 24 speakers.

The EM algorithm is an iterative scheme that is well-defined and numerically stable, but convergence may require a large number of iterations. For speech recognition systems utilizing large amounts of training material, this results in long training times. This paper presents an incremental estimation approach to speed-up the training of HMMs without any loss of recognition performance. The algorithm selects a subset of data from the training set, updates the model parameters based on the subset, and then iterates the process until convergence of the parameters. The advantage of this approach is a substantial increase in the number of iterations of the EM algorithm per training token, which leads to faster training. In order to achieve reliable estimation from a small fraction of the complete data set at each iteration, two training criteria are studied; ML and maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Experimental results show that the training of the incremental algorithms is substantially faster than the conventional (batch) method and suffers no loss of recognition performance. Furthermore, the incremental MAP based training algorithm improves performance over the batch version.","doi":"10.1109/89.725320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/15647/00725320.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.725320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15647","startPage":"539","endPage":"548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient training algorithms for HMMs using incremental estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=725320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient training algorithms for HMMs using incremental estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/725320/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6074781","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient training algorithms for HMMs using incremental estimation","sourcePdf":"00725320.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048799S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"22","articleId":"725320","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":725323,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

The algorithm scans a single-dipole model through a three-dimensional (3-D) head volume and computes projections onto an estimated signal subspace. To locate the sources, the user must search the head volume for multiple local peaks in the projection metric. This task is time consuming and subjective. Here, the authors describe an extension of this approach which they refer to as recursive MUSIC (R-MUSIC). This new procedure automatically extracts the locations of the sources through a recursive use of subspace projections. The new method is also able to locate synchronous sources through the use of a spatio-temporal independent topographies (IT) model. This model defines a source as one or more nonrotating dipoles with a single time course. Within this framework, the authors are able to locate fixed, rotating, and synchronous dipoles. The recursive subspace projection procedure that they introduce here uses the metric of canonical or subspace correlations as a multidimensional form of correlation analysis between the model subspace and the data subspace, by recursively computing subspace correlations, the authors build up a model for the sources which account for a given set of data. They demonstrate here how R-MUSIC can easily extract multiple asynchronous dipolar sources that are difficult to find using the original MUSIC scan. The authors then demonstrate R-MUSIC applied to the more general IT model and show results for combinations of fixed, rotating, and synchronous dipoles.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.725331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15646","startPage":"1342","endPage":"1354","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/15646/00725331.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive MUSIC: A framework for EEG and MEG source localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/725331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1998","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Recursive MUSIC: A framework for EEG and MEG source localization","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6072665","pubMedId":"9805833","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"45","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive MUSIC: A framework for EEG and MEG source localization","sourcePdf":"00725331.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023792S","chronDate":"Nov.  1998","isNumber":"15646","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"239","articleId":"725331","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":725338,"authors":[{"name":"A.T.

The goal is to provide wireless, battery-powered connectivity in adverse, shallow-water channels while maintaining a low probability of counter-detection. Telesonar type-B signaling combines powerful, non-binary convolutional error-correction coding, M-ary frequency-shift-keying (MFSK) modulation, and sophisticated frequency hopping. Non-coherent demodulation and sequential decoding provides reception at low signal-to-noise levels. The link protocol includes low-bit-rate handshaking to accommodate energy-conserving sleep modes and to achieve secure addressing, power control, channel characterization, and prioritization. Once the terminals have synchronized at the low bit rate, the message is transmitted with a bit rate and modulation appropriate for the prevailing channel. Power control ensures that messages are received with sufficient, but not excessive SNR. Frequency hopped spread-spectrum transmission supports asynchronous, code-division multiple access (CDMA) networking. Our analyses indicate that unauthorized observers require at least 10 dB more signal energy for detection than will the intended receiver.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1998.725795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15668","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1998.725795","endPage":"491 vol.1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society.

In the first approach, an interval input vector is generated from a new pattern by adding a certain width to its attribute values. In the second approach, neural networks are trained by interval input vectors generated from training patterns. These approaches are illustrated by a two-dimensional pattern classification problem.

Description deals with identifying patterns for the purpose of presenting them to users in a form understandable by humans. The ability of neural networks to learn patterns from noisy data made them a popular tool for data mining. The problem is, however, that neural networks do not provide description of the patterns they discover. In knowledge discovery for decision making the comprehensibility of discovered patterns is sometimes more important than their predictive capability. We describe a framework for a neural network based data mining system which presents discovered patterns in a comprehensible form. In this framework a neural network is first trained on a set of training data and a rule extraction technique is then applied in order to extract explicit knowledge from the network and represent it in the form of crisp and fuzzy If-Then rules. The framework is illustrated with an application.","doi":"10.1109/KES.1998.725897","startPage":"89","endPage":"92 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1998 Second International Conference.

In our method, antecedent linguistic values of a linguistic IF-THEN rule are presented to a trained neural network as inputs, and the corresponding fuzzy outputs are calculated by fuzzy arithmetic. The consequent class and the grade of certainty are determined based on the calculated fuzzy outputs. Thus the calculation of the fuzzy outputs is very important for the linguistic rule extraction. Because the fuzzy arithmetic is locally applied to the calculation at each unit, the fuzziness of the linguistic input values is usually increased by the feedforward calculation through the neural network. In this paper, we show how such increase of the fuzziness can be reduced by subdividing the level set (i.e., /spl alpha/-cut) of each linguistic input value in the calculation of the fuzzy outputs. The effect of such subdivision is illustrated by computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/KES.1998.725938","startPage":"387","endPage":"394 vol.2","publicationTitle":"1998 Second International Conference.

The parameters on which to act in order to maximize exploitation of the resources are the sequence of activities performed by each resource and the number of parts processed in each production cycle (WIP). The aim of the paper is to propose a performance optimization strategy which takes both these parameters into account. The strategy is based on a genetic algorithm, whose aim is to explore as far as possible sequences of activities performed by each resource. For each sequence, a heuristic algorithm, the adjustment heuristic algorithm, is applied to find the minimum WIP.

Evolution and learning can be explained as the mechanism of searching a solution in the enormous possibilities at the population level and individual level, respectively. There are two ways of combination of genetic algorithm and neural network: Darwinian and Lamarckian frameworks. In the Lamarckian framework the acquired traits during the lifetime can be passed on to the offspring directly, while in the Darwinian framework, these cannot be passed on. We propose a \"neural agent\" whose initial weights of their neural networks are determined by their genome data, as a simple model of the hybrid system of genetic algorithm and neural network. We examine which framework is better in the dynamic system. The result of our simulation shows that the Darwinian framework is better than Lamarckian.","doi":"10.1109/KES.1998.726025","startPage":"575","endPage":"584 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 Second International Conference.

Applying multisensor fusion algorithms in the vehicle navigation field has made it possible to make inexpensive and accurate positioning systems which will satisfy the requirements of railway systems. Kalman filtering, as one of the well known state estimation methods, has proved to be the most effective technique in multisensor data fusion for navigation applications. On the other hand reliability of the navigation system is of great concern which necessitates the design of a fault tolerant navigation system in which the detection and isolation of the faults is possible. The paper first addresses different multisensor integration methods and later discusses some of the fault detection methods for navigation systems using Kalman filtering and some simulation results are presented.

The paper presents a cellular automata based genetic algorithm (CAGA). In the CAGA, the individuals in the population are mapped onto a cellular automata to realise the locality and neighbourhood. The mapping is based on the individuals' fitness and the Hamming distances between individuals. The selection of individuals is controlled based on the structure of cellular automata, to avoid the fast population diversity loss and improve the convergence performance during the genetic search. Applications of CAGA to mechanical design optimisation and the coding to cope with different kinds of variables are discussed.

By using Q/sup 2/PSK, combinations of four, two or one data streams can be modulated in parallel in the same bandwidth as normally occupied by a QPSK system. This allows for even greater flexibility in terms of data throughput rate and reliability in accordance with the prevailing channel conditions. The disadvantages of the Q/sup 2/PSK modulation strategy, such as its inherent sensitivity to phase distortion, can be effectively mitigated by employing the multidimensional spreading technique proposed in this paper. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed Q/sup 2/PSK DS-SSMA system is assessed and demonstrated in a multi-user interference (MUI) environment by means of computer simulation. Very promising results is demonstrated with relatively short sequences used in the simulation studies.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.726184","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

Turbo codes have a built in structure that is suitable for diversity techniques to improve the quality of communications. The binary input data to a rate 1/(M+1) multiple turbo encoder produces M+1 coded bits, which, in turn, are assigned through suitable puncturing patterns to M different antennas and transmitted from each antenna simultaneously. The novelty of the transmission scheme, is that the original single-antenna rate-1/2 turbo coded system is transformed into a more powerful rate-1/(M+1) turbo code. The bit error rate performance of the proposed combined antenna and turbo coding diversity combining scheme is studied by means of simulation for a quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) DS/CDMA system on a non-frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel. Employing the turbo-coded/multi-antenna diversity combining scheme it is shown that lower bit error rate performance can be achieved, compared to a conventional single antenna scheme employing the same coding strategy.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

As for both successive and parallel cancellation, it is shown that the general linear group-wise scheme corresponds to a one-shot linear matrix filtering. Furthermore, it is shown that if the general structure converges, it converges to the decorrelator. Four structures are considered for the group detector, namely the matched filter, the parallel canceller, the decorrelator and the MMSE detector, and the equivalent one-shot filters are derived. Conditions for convergence related to the grouping are studied and it is shown that group detection with a decorrelator, which has conventional successive interference cancellation as a special case, always converges. Through numerical examples, it is illustrated that the performance for all the structures behaves like the performance for the linear successive canceller where a minimum BER is reached before convergence to the performance of the decorrelator occurs. The matched filter group canceller achieves the lowest minimum BER but also has the slowest convergence.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Silicon carbide","Decorrelation","Convergence","Matched filters","Nonlinear filters","Filtering","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","radiofrequency interference","matrix algebra","filtering theory","convergence of numerical methods","matched filters","signal detection","decorrelation","error statistics","radio links","land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear group-wise successive interference cancellation","CDMA","matrix algebra","parallel cancellation","one-shot linear matrix filtering","decorrelator","group detector","matched filter","MMSE detector","one-shot filters","convergence","group detection","performance","minimum BER","AWGN","uplink","UMTS/IMT2000"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=726209","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.726209","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

The concept of multi-code CDMA is based on the idea of splitting a single sequence (at high symbol rate) that uses low processing gain into a number of sequences (at lower symbol rate) that require higher processing gain. However, using conventional matched filter detectors the gain from the increase in the processing gain is neutralised by the introduction of interference by the generated sequences.

The proposed receiver achieves narrowband interference rejection by projecting the received waveform onto the orthogonal complement of the subspace spanned by the interference: this operation is shown to entail in general a time-varying processing of the observables. In order to improve the system performance, the possibility of considering an observation interval larger than the bit signaling time T/sub b/, is exploited as well as that of sampling the received waveform faster than the chip-rate. As to the performance assessment, we focus on the relevant case of Rayleigh distributed fading, and give closed-form formulas for the system bit error rate (BER) and near-far resistance. The results show that the system largely outperforms conventional detectors, in that it achieves a complete nullification of the interference, no matter its energy. Additionally, as expected, increasing the sampling rate and the processing window length yields a performance improvement.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.726212","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

In order to achieve better performance in the transmission of the DS-CDMA signal, it has been shown that a narrowband interference rejection technique should be used at the receiver. A transform domain notch filter-based narrowband interference rejection technique, which is one of the most useful techniques in a sense of practicality, distorts the DS-CDMA signal while it can drastically improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of the DS-CDMA system. We discuss the performance of a band-limited DS-CDMA system with notch filtering. Here we theoretically analyze the signal-to-noise plus interference power ratio (S/(N+I)) of the DS-CDMA signal and derive a closed-form expression of the SI(N+I) when we assume an ideal notch filter, which can perfectly reject the narrowband interference. Then, we compare the theoretical results with computer simulation results using a DSP-based notch filter.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

This detector combines the successive and parallel interference cancellation concepts, and hence is called a hybrid interference canceller (HIC). In the HIC, the active users are split into a number of groups. Within each group, parallel detection is performed. Between the groups, serial cancellation is carried out. The performance is evaluated over both single-path and multipath channels and it is shown through simulation that the HIC detector has a performance close to the successive interference canceller, but with a much less detection delay. The detector also overcomes the \"ping-pong\" behaviour of the conventional parallel interference canceller at the cost of an additional detection delay.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid interference canceller in CDMA","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

The CDMA-DSSS channel with randomly and independently chosen spreading sequences accurately models the situation where pseudo-noise sequences span many symbol periods. Its information theoretic analysis provides a comparison baseline for CDMA channels with carefully designed signature waveforms that span one bit period on one hand and optimal multiple-user coded systems on the other. We analyze the spectral efficiency (total capacity per chip) as a function of the number of users, spreading gain and signal-to-noise ratio, and we quantify the loss in efficiency relative to an optimally chosen set of signature sequences and to an optimal multiaccess system without spreading. White Gaussian background noise and equal-power synchronous users are assumed. The analysis comprises the following receivers: (a) optimal joint processing, (b) single-user matched filtering; (c) decorrelation and (d) minimum mean square error linear processing. Some implications due to fading are also addressed.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.726216","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

Two reduced complexity techniques are considered: (1) filter truncation and (2) linear combining of multiple truncated subfilters. In both cases, the dimension of the (sub)filters must be larger than that of the user subspace.

However, while downlink design is possible even with M-QAM modulation schemes, a similar solution is much more difficult on the uplink because its asynchronous character complicates the channel identification. Indeed, performance of M-QAM schemes depends strongly on the accuracy of the channel estimation, as well as the adopted equalization techniques. We propose an uplink architecture based on chip-level differential encoding. This choice is motivated by the need to simplify the hardware structure and the channel estimation algorithms as well as to reduce the sensitivity to possible phase noise in the frequency down-conversion circuit. The numerical results of this work are preliminary and they are based on simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

It is shown that the time-domain crosscorrelation function between the spreading sequences is not a proper interference measure for the asynchronous MC-CDMA users. Therefore the spectral correlation function is introduced and, together with the crest factor and the dynamic range of the corresponding multicarrier waveforms, is used for the evaluation of MC-CDMA sequences. Some well-known classes of sequences, such as Walsh and Gold sequences, as well as orthogonal Gold and Zadoff-Chu (1972) sequences, are evaluated with respect to the aforementioned basic criteria. It is also shown that the multicarrier spread spectrum waveforms based on the multilevel Huffman sequences can have a lower crest factor than a single sine wave.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

The channel characteristics are gained by several measurements of attenuation and a noise survey having been performed by the author in different locations. These investigations lead to a system based on the OFDM technique which is also presented. For such an OFDM system many parameters have to be suitably selected, such as the algorithm that distributes the data among the different subchannels by selecting different modulation schemes for each subchannel.

Realistic DC models based on nested HMM are built for different coding and interleaving schemes evaluation. At the same time these models provide the basis for different FEC-ARQ schemes studies.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

The network employs direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) in a centralised channel load-sensing scheme with channel overload (collision) detection and blocking. A finite population, packetisation of variable length messages and partial message retransmission scheme are considered in the protocol. For a given maximum bit error rate due to mutual multi-access interference (MAI), an upper threshold (/spl beta/) for the number of users allowed in the channel can be determined. This paper proposes a second lower threshold, /spl alpha/, to improve the system performance by adding an access control mechanism.

In this protocol, every channel is available for use in every cell and channel access decisions are made by the mobiles based on information broadcast from the base stations. This information is broadcast in the form of a channel access probability which is periodically updated at each base station. This is different from the access strategies which have appeared in the literature where call requests are processed solely by the base stations. One of the meaningful parameters in the performance characteristics of CDMA networks is outage which is critical because of CDMA capacity dependence on signal-to-interference ratio. In order to fully characterise outage in the network, we present a transient analysis of the distributed admission scheme.

As a result, we found that if the access timing delay is relatively small, CLSP achieves a good throughput. However, degradation is found in the presence of access timing delay. Both MCLSP and PRC achieves the same throughput and they are robust to access timing delay. As for OACP, it shows superior throughput when the access timing delay is small yet shows robustness to access timing delay.","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1998.726245","publicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

First, the main parameters of W-CDMA (wideband CDMA) are presented. W-CDMA refers to the air interface that was decided by the ETSI to be standardised for the UMTS air interface for paired bands. Secondly, the W-CDMA packet transmission scheme with soft combining of packets is introduced. Soft combining indicates the combining of the soft values of the unsuccessful transmission with the retransmission before feeding them to the channel decoder. The performance of soft combining is compared to the performance of noncombining packet solution. The results show that soft combining can increase the capacity and extend the cell range up to 2 dB against Gaussian noise if no fast power control is used. With fast power control the gain is 0.3-2.0 dB. Soft combining can also be used to decrease the maximum packet delays. It is also shown that using slow power control instead of fast power control can increase the packet data capacity in the downlink.","displayPublicationTitle":"1998 IEEE 5th International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications - Proceedings.

Data compression eliminates redundancy of transmitted information and therefore improves the efficiency of the entire mission. In some applications, acoustic and non-acoustic sensor information is acquired and processed to produce a visual representation for ease of human-in-the-loop analysis and interpretation. Many image and data compression methods are currently in development. Emphasis has been placed on achieving high efficiency as characterized by compression ratio while retaining the least error between the original image and the compressed image. Although some algorithms produce excellent results, computational complexity, and hence speed of compression or decompression, can become a limiting factor in real-time use depending upon the capability of the on-board processor. This paper describes the implementation of a high performance image compression transform using a dedicated DSP processor and supporting computer host. The system architecture and strategy for efficient code implementation are described. Example performance measures are presented for non-acoustic undersea studies. Future plans and developments for specialized applications are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1998.726363","publicationTitle":"IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society. OCEANS'98.

The resonator is excited by a short RF pulse and decays after switching off the interrogating signal. In the measurement system, a gated phase locked loop (GPLL) locks to the resonance frequency of the SAW resonator within a few bursts. Then the frequency of the GPLL oscillator is synchronized to the resonance of the sensor and can be measured easily. The concept is intended to yield an alternative to interrogators with expensive signal processing. Considering the inherent limitations, the proposed system presents a low cost solution for temperature, force, torque, etc. measurements. We describe the sensors, the signals, and the implemented system.

In this paper a new sensor design that uses the differential frequency output from two SAW resonators (SAWR) for temperature and pressure measurement is presented. The sensor, which consists of two SAWRs on the same substrate with different SAW propagation directions, relies on the variations of the SAW propagation velocity to measure environmental quantities such as pressure or temperature. The aim of this approach is to suppress the disturbing influences of the RF link (radio channel) between the interrogation unit and the passive sensor device. In this case, the output signal is a frequency difference and does not depend on changes in the radio channel during the transmission of the sensor signal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive remote sensing for temperature and pressure using SAW resonator devices","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.726466","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/58/15673/00726466.pdf","startPage":"1388","endPage":"1392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.726466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=726466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726466/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Passive remote sensing for temperature and pressure using SAW resonator devices","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1998","accessionNumber":"6073296","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive remote sensing for temperature and pressure using SAW resonator devices","sourcePdf":"00726466.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042587S","chronDate":"Sept.  1998","isNumber":"15673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"94","articleId":"726466","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":726483,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

The code thus created should not only have the same accuracy as a more conventional computer code, but should still retain the ability of an ANN to modify itself when exposed to experimental data, thus yielding software that could be specialized with experimental results. To accomplish these objectives, the method of optimal incremental function approximation has been developed for the adaptive solution of differential equations using ANN architecture. Two major attractive features of this approach are that: (1) the developed method is flexible enough to use any of the popular transfer functions and (2) the developed method requires minimal user interaction. The latter is especially advantageous when dealing with complicated physical or computational domains. Numerical results are presented and compared to conventional methods. The accuracy is considered satisfactory.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1998.726483","startPage":"3130","endPage":"3135 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"SMC'98 Conference Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

Two examples involving a single input-single output (SISO) phase-locked-loop motor speed system with a lead/lag type controller and an MIMO supermaneuverable F18/HARV fighter aircraft system with a PID-type controller are given to illustrate the design procedure and exhibit the performance of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726532/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6082045","volume":"6","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A structure-specified H/sup /spl infin// optimal control design for practical applications: a genetic approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A structure-specified H/sup /spl infin// optimal control design for practical applications: a genetic approach","sourcePdf":"00726532.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02199S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"68","articleId":"726532","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":726538,"authors":[{"name":"Xianyi Yang","affiliation":["ART Advanced Robotics & Teleoperation Laboratory Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"lastName":"Xianyi Yang","id":"37087156889"},{"name":"M.

The neural network is topologically organised, which is based on a previous biologically inspired model for dynamical trajectory generation of a mobile robot in a nonstationary environment. The state space of the neural network can be the joint space of multilink robot manipulators or the Cartesian workspace. This model is capable of dealing with multiple target problems as well. The target globally attracts the robot, while the obstacles push the robot away locally to avoid collisions. By taking into account of the clearance from obstacles, the planned \"comfortable\" path does not suffer either the \"too close\" or the \"too far\" problems. Each neuron has only local lateral connections. The optimal path is generated in real-time through the dynamics of the neural activity landscape without explicitly optimising any cost function. Therefore, it is computationally efficient. The stability of the network is guaranteed by the existence of a Lyapunov function. The effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated through simulation studies.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1998.726538","pdfPath":"/iel4/5875/15672/00726538.pdf","startPage":"3412","endPage":"3417 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"SMC'98 Conference Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

Performance is increased with a windowpane arrangement of global clock drivers for lowering skew and employing local clocks for time borrowing. Power is reduced by using major clocks and local conditional clocks. Complexity is managed by partitioning the analysis depending on the type of clock. Design and characterization of global and major clocks use both an AWEsim-based computer-aided design (CAD) tool and SPICE.

Three key circuit techniques for achieving this high speed are a decoder using source-coupled-logic (SCL) circuits combined with reset circuits, a sense amplifier with nMOS source followers, and a sense-amplifier activation-pulse generator that uses a duplicate memory-cell array. The proposed decoder can reduce the delay time between the address input and the word-line signal of the 4.5-Mb SRAM to 68% of that of an SRAM with conventional circuits. The sense amplifier with nMOS source followers can reduce not only the delay time of the sense amplifier but also the power dissipation. In the SRAM, the sense-amplifier activation pulse must be input into the sense amplifier after the signal from the memory cell is input into the sense amplifier. A large timing margin required between these signals results in a large access time in the conventional SRAM. The sense-amplifier activation pulse generator that uses a duplicate memory-cell array can reduce the required timing margin to less than half of the conventional margin. These three techniques are especially useful for realizing ultrahigh-speed SRAM's, which will be used as on-chip or off-chip cache memories in processor systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726553/","volume":"33","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"6087316","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 1.8-ns access, 550-MHz, 4.5-Mb CMOS SRAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1.8-ns access, 550-MHz, 4.5-Mb CMOS SRAM","sourcePdf":"00726553.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124713S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"31","articleId":"726553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":726555,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

Content addressable memories (CAMs) provide built-in hardware lookup capability with high speed and high flexibility in address allocation. Previous high-capacity CAMs have been inadequate for emerging applications; comparators are time-shared among multiple bits or multiple words, resulting in serialized operation, Fully parallel architectures represent the best solution for high-speed operation, but previous fully parallel CAMs have lacked the capacity required for leading-edge networking applications. This paper describes a fully parallel (single-clock-cycle) CAM chip. The chip uses a 0.35-/spl mu/m digital CMOS technology to achieve 2.5 Mb of CAM storage and 30-MHz operating frequency. Innovative layout techniques are used to achieve two-dimensional decoding, a traditional problem with high-capacity CAMs. Architecture and operation of the chip are described, including a novel NAND match architecture, operation-specific self-timing loops, and on-board cascade management circuits. The chip functions at 31 MHz, with a search access time of 26 ns and an average search power dissipation of 5.2 W at 25 MHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/15684/00726560.pdf","startPage":"1690","endPage":"1696","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/4.726560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.726560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15684","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=726560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fully parallel 30-MHz, 2.5-Mb CAM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer aided manufacturing","CADCAM","CMOS technology","Communication networks","IP networks","Protocols","Asynchronous transfer mode","Table lookup","Associative memory","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","table lookup","memory architecture","CMOS memory circuits","decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAM","built-in hardware lookup capability","address allocation","fully parallel architectures","leading-edge networking applications","digital CMOS technology","layout techniques","two-dimensional decoding","NAND match architecture","operation-specific self-timing loops","on-board cascade management circuits","search access time","average search power dissipation","30 MHz","2.5 Mbit","0.35 micron","26 ns","5.2 W"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","displayDocTitle":"Fully parallel 30-MHz, 2.5-Mb CAM","volume":"33","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6087320","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fully parallel 30-MHz, 2.5-Mb CAM","sourcePdf":"00726560.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036816S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"71","articleId":"726560","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":726562,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We also propose a vernier-type, high-accuracy delay-locked-loop circuit realizing /spl plusmn/20-ps quantization errors for clock recovery and skew elimination.","doi":"10.1109/4.726562","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/15684/00726562.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.726562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15684","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","startPage":"1697","endPage":"1702","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A 1-Gb SDRAM with ground-level precharged bit line and nonboosted 2.1-V word line","volume":"33","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6087321","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726562/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1-Gb SDRAM with ground-level precharged bit line and nonboosted 2.1-V word line","sourcePdf":"00726562.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053297S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"10","articleId":"726562","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":726563,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

Eliminating the precharge cycle of the DRAM data bus can reduce the unit bit time. A differential partial response detection data-bus amplifier is also employed to detect signals on the nonprecharged data bus that are degraded by large intersymbol interference. To enhance the read operation further, column selections are overlapped by interleaved column decoders. To increase the operating margin of the nonprecharged data-bus read, a skew-controlled column-selection pulse generator was developed. An isolated sense-amplifier scheme increases the write data rate of the DRAM core. To verify these schemes, a 4-Mb DRAM was fabricated via 0.24-/spl mu/m DRAM technology. These schemes realized a 500-Mb/s per data-bus read operation and a 100-Mb/s per data-bus write operation without an area penalty.","doi":"10.1109/4.726566","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel4/4/15684/00726566.pdf","startPage":"1720","endPage":"1730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.726566","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"500-Mb/s nonprecharged data bus for high-speed DRAM's","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","displayDocTitle":"500-Mb/s nonprecharged data bus for high-speed DRAM's","volume":"33","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6087323","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726566/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"500-Mb/s nonprecharged data bus for high-speed DRAM's","sourcePdf":"00726566.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042593S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"3","articleId":"726566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":726567,"authors":[{"name":"Seul Jung","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Chungnam National University, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seul Jung","id":"37087156929"},{"name":"B.

That requires the correct kinematic Jacobian information. Since the actual mapping from the Cartesian space to the joint space is obtained at the joint coordinate not at the actuator coordinate, uncertainty in the Jacobian can be present. In the paper two feasible neural network schemes are proposed to compensate for the kinematic Jacobian uncertainty. Uncertainty in the Jacobian can be compensated by identifying either the actuator Jacobian matrix off-line or the inverse of that in online fashion.

The processor-based test engine, with two separate instruction storage memories, combines with flexible address, data, and clock generators to provide DRAM high-performance ac testing using a minimum of dedicated test pins. Test results are compressed through on-macro, two-dimensional, redundancy allocation logic to provide direct programming information for the fuser via a serial scan port. The design is intended for reuse on future DRAM-generation subarrays and can be adapted to any number of address or data-pin configurations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726568/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","volume":"33","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"6087324","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Processor-based built-in self-test for embedded DRAM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processor-based built-in self-test for embedded DRAM","sourcePdf":"00726568.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038534S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"60","articleId":"726568","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":726569,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

An expandable floor layout scheme achieves the macro size comparable to that of handicraft-designed DRAM. The memory generator can customize a configurable redundancy scheme for various macro configurations. Unified testing circuits make it possible to test DRAM macros with more than 500 interface pins in a direct-memory-access mode with 33 test pads.

In this paper, we investigate the key technologies to achieve terabit/second wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) systems with over 1 bit/s/Hz spectral efficiency. Optical duobinary signals, which have narrower optical spectra than conventional intensity modulation signals, were applied to such dense WDM systems. The measured minimum channel spacing for 20-Gbit/s optical duobinary signals was 32 GHz and a spectral efficiency of over 0.6 bit/s/Hz was reached. By using polarization interleave multiplexing, spectral efficiency was expected to reach 1.2 bit/s/Hz in an ideal case with no polarization dependencies along the transmission lines. In such ultradense WDM systems with narrower channel spacing, stabilizing the wavelengths of laser diodes is an important issue for achieving stable operation over long periods. To do this, we developed a simple and flexible wavelength stabilization system which uses a multiwavelength meter. The wavelengths for 116 channels with 35-GHz spacing were stabilized within /spl plusmn/150 MHz. The stabilization system is applicable to ultradense WDM signals with a spectral efficiency of over 1 bit/s/Hz by employing wavelength interleave multiplexing and an optical selector switch. On the basis of these investigations, we demonstrated a 2.6-Tbit/s (20 Gbit/s/spl times/132 channels) WDM transmission by using optical duobinary signals. In addition, 1.28-Tbit/s (20 Gbit/s/spl times/64 channels) WDM transmission with a high spectral efficiency of 1 bit/s/Hz was achieved by using polarization interleave multiplexing.","doi":"10.1109/3.726596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.726596","startPage":"2080","endPage":"2088","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/3/15685/00726596.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15685","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Key technologies for terabit/second WDM systems with high spectral efficiency of over 1 bit/s/Hz","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","displayDocTitle":"Key technologies for terabit/second WDM systems with high spectral efficiency of over 1 bit/s/Hz","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"34","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6087364","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726596/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Key technologies for terabit/second WDM systems with high spectral efficiency of over 1 bit/s/Hz","sourcePdf":"00726596.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05415S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15685","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"41","articleId":"726596","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":726597,"authors":[{"name":"D.B.

The stencilling robot mounted on a truck is required to draw lines and characters in the Cartesian space. One of the goals of the stencilling robot design is to make the controller as simple as possible such that a simple PID controller can be used. Since the robot is huge and heavy, the inertia of the robot is expected to play a major role in the tracking performance. The conventional PID controller works within certain accuracy, but does not guarantee the accurate trading performance as desired. Here we propose a neural network control scheme for a computed-torque like controller for the stencilling robot. The stability of the closed loop system is analyzed based on the Lyapunov theory. Simulation studies with the stencilling robot are carried out to test the performances.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1998.726599","startPage":"3554","endPage":"3559 vol.4","publicationTitle":"SMC'98 Conference Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

A two-stage hot-carrier degradation is clearly observed for all the biasing conditions, for both N- and P-channel devices and for all the gate lengths.

Given that many common groundwater contaminants are hazardous at very low concentrations, even a small violation of the water quality may be the difference between reaching a hazardous or nonhazardous end point. Furthermore, the remediation costs increase dramatically as one attempts to remove the last units of concentration. This work compares two methods for constraint-handling, an additive penalty method and a multiplicative penalty, for use in optimal groundwater remediation design with a genetic algorithm. The multiplicative approach was found to be a more robust technique for finding cost-effective designs, while enforcing the water quality constraints.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1998.726703","startPage":"3937","endPage":"3942 vol.4","publicationTitle":"SMC'98 Conference Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

The method incorporates the wavelet transform and a self-development neural network-the Vitality Conservation (VC) network to achieve significant improvement in image compression performance. The implementation consists of three steps. The image is first decomposed at different scales using wavelet transform to obtain an orthogonal wavelet representation of the image. Each band can be subsequently processed in parallel. In the second step, the discrete Karhunen-Loeve transform is used to extract the principal components of the wavelet coefficients. Thus, the processing speed can be much faster than otherwise. Finally, results of the second step are used as input to the VC network for vector quantization. Our simulation results show that such an implementation can, in much less time, achieve superior reconstructed images to other methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726732/","accessionNumber":"6189501","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-14 Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Image compression using wavelet transform and self-development neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image compression using wavelet transform and self-development neural network","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00726732.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048673S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875","citationCount":"1","articleId":"726732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":726739,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Fuzzy and other adaptive systems can learn to induce SR based only on samples from the process. The paper derives the SR optimality conditions that any stochastic learning system should try to achieve. The adaptive system learns the SR effect as the system performs a stochastic gradient ascent on the signal-to-noise ratio. The stochastic learning scheme does not depend on a fuzzy system or any other adaptive system. Simulations test this SR learning scheme on the popular quartic-bistable dynamical system and on other dynamical systems. The driving noise types range from Gaussian white noise to impulsive noise to chaotic noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"86","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6081647","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive stochastic resonance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive stochastic resonance","sourcePdf":"00726785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172686S","chronDate":"Nov.  1998","isNumber":"15641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"222","articleId":"726785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":726787,"authors":[{"name":"P.

We show that in some contexts this idea is mathematically equivalent to incorporating the prior knowledge as a regularizer, suggesting that the strategy is well motivated.

We address the development of models of nonlinear dynamical systems, in the form of time-lagged recurrent neural nets, which can be used without further training. We employ a weight update procedure based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Against the tendency for a net to forget earlier learning as it processes new examples, we develop a technique called multistream training. We demonstrate our framework by applying it to 4 problems. First, we show that a single time-lagged recurrent net can be trained to produce excellent one-time-step predictions for two different time series and also to be robust to severe errors in the input sequence. Second, we model stably a complex system containing significant process noise. The remaining two problems are drawn from real-world automotive applications. One involves input-output modeling of the dynamic behavior of a catalyst-sensor system which is exposed to an operating engine's exhaust stream, the other the real-time and continuous detection of engine misfire.","doi":"10.1109/5.726790","startPage":"2259","endPage":"2277","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel4/5/15641/00726790.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.726790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A signal processing framework based on dynamic neural networks with application to problems in adaptation, filtering, and classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing","Neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Vehicle dynamics","Adaptive filters","Adaptive signal processing","System identification","Filtering","Pattern classification","Recurrent neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal processing","recurrent neural nets","filtering theory","pattern classification","adaptive estimation","identification","modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recency","signal processing framework","dynamic neural networks","universal approximators","nonlinear dynamical systems","system identification","time-series prediction","nonlinear adaptive filtering","temporal pattern classification","time-lagged recurrent neural nets","weight update procedure","extended Kalman filter","EKF","multistream training","one-time-step predictions","time series","robustness","complex system","process noise","input-output modeling","I/O modeling","catalyst-sensor system","engine misfire"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726790/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1998","displayDocTitle":"A signal processing framework based on dynamic neural networks with application to problems in adaptation, filtering, and classification","volume":"86","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6081652","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A signal processing framework based on dynamic neural networks with application to problems in adaptation, filtering, and classification","sourcePdf":"00726790.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055428S","chronDate":"Nov.  1998","isNumber":"15641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"91","articleId":"726790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":726791,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726791/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1998","volume":"86","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"6081653","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition","sourcePdf":"00726791.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078436S","chronDate":"Nov.  1998","isNumber":"15641","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"18513","articleId":"726791","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":726792,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Ways to deal with the issue of nonstationarity are discussed, starting with Loeve's probabilistic theory of stationarity processes (1946, 1963). Three important tools emerge: the dynamic spectrum, the Wigner-Ville distribution as an instantaneous estimate of the dynamic spectrum and the Loeve spectrum. Procedures for the estimation of these spectra are described, and their applications are demonstrated using real-life radar data. Time, an essential dimension of learning, appears explicitly in the dynamic spectrum and Wigner-Ville distribution and implicitly in the Loeve spectrum. In each case, the 1D time series is transformed into a 2D image where the presence of nonstationarity is displayed in a more visible manner than in the original time series. This sets the stage for reformulating the signal detection problem as an adaptive pattern classification whereby we can exploit the learning property of neural nets. Hence, we describe a novel learning strategy for distinguishing between the different classes of received signals, such as 1) there is no target signal present in the received signal; 2) the target signal is weak; and 3) the target signal is strong.

Thus far, this problem has been solved using statistical information available on the source signals. This paper introduces a new blind source separation approach exploiting the difference in the time-frequency (t-f) signatures of the sources to be separated. The approach is based on the diagonalization of a combined set of \"spatial t-f distributions\". In contrast to existing techniques, the proposed approach allows the separation of Gaussian sources with identical spectral shape but with different t-f localization properties. The effects of spreading the noise power while localizing the source energy in the t-f domain amounts to increasing the robustness of the proposed approach with respect to noise and, hence, improved performance.

Because multiwavelet bases normally lack important properties that traditional wavelet bases (of equal approximation order) possess, the associated discrete multiwavelet transform is less useful for signal processing unless it is preceded by a preprocessing step (prefiltering). This paper examines the properties and design of orthogonal multiwavelet bases, with approximation order >1 that possess those properties that are normally absent. For these \"balanced\" bases (so named by Lebrun and Vetterli (see Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Acoust., Speech, Signal Process. (ICASSP), Munich, Germany, vol.3, p.2473-76, 1997 and ibid., vol.46, p.1119-24, 1998)), prefiltering can be avoided. By reorganizing the multiwavelet filter bank, the development in this paper draws from results regarding the approximation order of M-band wavelet bases. The main result thereby obtained is a characterization of balanced multiwavelet bases in terms of the divisibility of certain transfer functions by powers of (z/sup -2r/-1)/(z/sup -1/-1). For traditional wavelets (r=1), this specializes to the usual factor (z+1)/sup K/.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/15687/00726804.pdf","startPage":"2898","endPage":"2908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.726804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.726804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=726804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiwavelet bases with extra approximation properties","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Filter bank","Filtering theory","Transfer functions","Wavelet transforms","Signal processing","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transforms","band-pass filters","filtering theory","signal processing","transfer functions","approximation theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation properties","transfer functions divisibility","signal processing","preprocessing step","prefiltering","orthogonal multiwavelet bases design","multiwavelet filter bank","approximation order"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","displayDocTitle":"Multiwavelet bases with extra approximation properties","volume":"46","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6088648","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiwavelet bases with extra approximation properties","sourcePdf":"00726804.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033464S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"62","articleId":"726804","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":726807,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

Such problems arise, for example, in positioning using carrier phase measurements in the global positioning system (GPS), where the unknown integers enter the equations as the number of carrier signal cycles between the receiver and the satellites when the carrier signal is initially phase locked. Given a linear model, we address two problems: (1) the problem of estimating the parameters and (2) the problem of verifying the parameter estimates. We show that with additive Gaussian measurement noise the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters are given by solving an integer least-squares problem. Theoretically, this problem is very difficult computationally (NP-hard); verifying the parameter estimates (computing the probability of estimating the integer parameters correctly) requires computing the integral of a Gaussian probability density function over the Voronoi cell of a lattice. This problem is also very difficult computationally. However, by using a polynomial-time algorithm due to Lenstra, Lenstra, and Lovasz (1982), the LLL algorithm, the integer least-squares problem associated with estimating the parameters can be solved efficiently in practice; sharp upper and lower bounds can be found on the probability of correct integer parameter estimation. We conclude the paper with simulation results that are based on a synthetic GPS setup.","doi":"10.1109/78.726808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/15687/00726808.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.726808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15687","startPage":"2938","endPage":"2952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integer parameter estimation in linear models with applications to GPS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=726808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integer parameter estimation in linear models with applications to GPS","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726808/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6088652","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integer parameter estimation in linear models with applications to GPS","sourcePdf":"00726808.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037927S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"125","articleId":"726808","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":726809,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Both techniques are completely blind in the sense that no knowledge of the signatures, channel state information, or training sequences is required for any user. Once convergence has been achieved, an estimate of the signature of each user convolved with its physical channel response (CR) and estimated data sequences are provided. This CR estimate can be used to switch to any decision-directed (DD) adaptation scheme.

Time series belonging to this class are characterized by multivariate statistical functions that are almost-periodic functions of time whose Fourier series expansions can exhibit coefficients and frequencies depending on the lag shifts of the time series. Moreover, the union over all the lag shifts of the lag-dependent frequency sets is not necessarily countable. Almost-cyclostationary (ACS) time series turn out to be the subclass of GACS time series for which the frequencies do not depend on the lag shifts and the union of the above-mentioned sets is countable. The higher order characterization of GACS time series in the strict and wide sense is provided. It is shown that the characterization in terms of cyclic moment and cumulant functions is inadequate for those GACS time series that are not ACS. Then, generalized cyclic moment and cumulant functions (in both the time and frequency domains) are introduced. Finally, the problem of estimating the introduced generalized cyclic statistics is addressed, and two examples of GACS time series are considered.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.726811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/15687/00726811.pdf","startPage":"2975","endPage":"2989","doi":"10.1109/78.726811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The higher order theory of generalized almost-cyclostationary time series","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","displayDocTitle":"The higher order theory of generalized almost-cyclostationary time series","volume":"46","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6088655","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726811/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The higher order theory of generalized almost-cyclostationary time series","sourcePdf":"00726811.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03561S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"53","articleId":"726811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":726813,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"lastName":"Hui Liu","id":"37279498800"},{"name":"G.B.

It is shown in this paper that the choice of the constraint parameters in the multipath case can have a significant effect on the system performance. A max/min approach for optimizing the constraint is proposed, resulting in blind solutions with improved performance. It is shown that the performance of the proposed method tends to be close to that of the MMSE receiver at high SNR, whereas the constraint parameters converge to the multipath channel parameters.

This technique is based on signal subspace estimation. The receiver employs a bank of linear filters (decorrelating filters or linear MMSE filters) at the front end to mitigate the multiple-access interference and the multipath interference. A channel estimator is used to estimate the channel state for diversity combining. It is shown that through the use of signal subspace estimation, both the decorrelating filterbank and the linear MMSE filterbank can be obtained blindly, i.e., they can be estimated from the received signal with the prior knowledge of only the signature waveform of the desired user. Two forms of the subspace-based linear filterbanks are developed and their equivalence in terms of the interference suppression capability is established. These subspace-based blind adaptive interference suppression techniques require, at each symbol epoch, the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of an appropriate signal subspace, which ran be obtained using computationally efficient sequential adaptive eigendecomposition (subspace tracking) algorithms. Moreover, a blind adaptive method for estimating the channel state is developed, which also produces the postcombining decision statistic as a byproduct.","doi":"10.1109/78.726816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.726816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/15687/00726816.pdf","startPage":"3030","endPage":"3044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind adaptive multiuser detection in multipath CDMA channels based on subspace tracking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","displayDocTitle":"Blind adaptive multiuser detection in multipath CDMA channels based on subspace tracking","volume":"46","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6088660","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind adaptive multiuser detection in multipath CDMA channels based on subspace tracking","sourcePdf":"00726816.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09344S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"108","articleId":"726816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":726818,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The correct classification of the beats relies heavily on the efficient and accurate extraction of the ST segment features. An algorithm is developed for this feature extraction based on nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA). NLPCA is a method for nonlinear feature extraction that is usually implemented by a multilayer neural network. It has been observed to have better performance, compared with linear principal component analysis (PCA), in complex problems where the relationships between the variables are not linear. In this paper, the NLPCA techniques are used to classify each segment into one of two classes: normal and abnormal (ST+, ST-, or artifact). During the algorithm training phase, only normal patterns are used, and for classification purposes, we use only two nonlinear features for each ST segment. The distribution of these features is modeled using a radial basis function network (RBFN). Test results using the European ST-T database show that using only two nonlinear components and a training set of 1000 normal samples from each file produce a correct classification rate of approximately 80% for the normal beats and higher than 90% for the ischemic beats.","doi":"10.1109/78.726818","startPage":"3058","endPage":"3067","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/15687/00726818.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.726818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG analysis using nonlinear PCA neural networks for ischemia detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Principal component analysis","Neural networks","Ischemic pain","Signal processing algorithms","Feature extraction","Multi-layer neural network","Biomedical signal processing","Patient monitoring","Radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","medical signal processing","signal detection","feature extraction","pattern classification","feedforward neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG analysis","nonlinear PCA neural networks","ischemia detection","ischemic cardiac beats","electrocardiogram","ST segment","beat classification","feature extraction","nonlinear principal component analysis","multilayer neural network","performance","linear principal component analysis","abnormal patterns","algorithm training phase","normal patterns","radial basis function network","European ST-T database","training set","correct classification rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/726818/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","displayDocTitle":"ECG analysis using nonlinear PCA neural networks for ischemia detection","volume":"46","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6088662","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG analysis using nonlinear PCA neural networks for ischemia detection","sourcePdf":"00726818.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078129S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"107","articleId":"726818","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":726821,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

These problems are presented in the paper as different modifications of a general optimization problem, and each of them has multiple minima and maxima. The usual optimization procedures converge to a minimum/maximum depending on the initial guesses of variables and numerical methods used. In the considered problems, all the extreme points are of interest. Additionally, there are difficulties with finding the derivatives of the objective functions with respect to parameters. Numerical computations of derivatives in traditional optimization procedures are time consuming. In the paper, we propose a new black box genetic technique for comprehensive small signal stability analysis, which can effectively cope with highly nonlinear objective functions with multiple minima and maxima and derivatives which can not be expressed analytically.","doi":"10.1049/cp:19971857","pdfPath":"/iel4/5865/15678/00726896.pdf","startPage":"342","endPage":"347 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 Fourth International Conference on Advances in Power System Control, Operation and Management, APSCOM-97.

The active device region is carefully designed so that the overlap between the extrinsic base and the sub-collector is totally eliminated for minimizing the base collector capacitance and maximizing the device f/sub max/. Simulations on SBSC HBT microwave amplifiers show that >10 W output power may be achievable with PAE>50% and OIP3=40 dBm at 7-11 GHz (X-band) and >4 W output power with PAE=30% and OIP3=32 dBm at 28-32 GHz (Ka-band).

Their system and similar systems are called MC-DS-CDMA systems. The dramatic performance improvement of this system (as compared to a single carrier system operating in a flat fading channel) is due, in part, to the use of coherent modulation/demodulation and perfect knowledge of the complex channel gains for each of the independent channels associated with every subcarrier. In this paper we investigate the performance degradation associated with a more easily realized system. Our system employs differentially coherent modulation/demodulation with an equal gain combiner (EGC) at the receiver. We investigate the performance of this system operating in a doubly spread (Doppler and delay spread) channel. In a doubly spread channel, any system which does not account for the rapid variations in channel phase will exhibit an irreducible bit error probability. This phenomenon exists even for the single user case. A system utilizing an EGC is analyzed for the single user case and in the presence of multiple access interference (MAI). The MC-DS-CDMA single user system, with E/sub b//N/sub 0/=18.5 dB, can achieve a BEP of 10/sup -6/ in a doubly spread channel (f/sub d/T=0.08 and a channel delay spread, /spl tau//sub 0/=1 /spl nu/s), while a single carrier DPSK system operating at the same E/sub b//N/sub 0/ and under the same channel conditions would achieve a BEP of 0.037. The multi-user system with 50 active users would achieve a BEP of 0.008 as compared to a BEP of 0.07 for a single carrier system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Military Communications Conference.

This paper presents algorithmic level theory and optimization techniques to select distinct word lengths for each computation which meet the desired accuracy and minimize the design cost for the given performance constraints. The reduction in cost is possible by avoiding unnecessary bit-level computations that do not contribute significantly to the accuracy of the final results. Thus we have introduced a new optimization variable, computation accuracy, into data-path synthesis. Our results show on an average, a 30% reduction in functional-resource area using distinct word lengths as opposed to use of a single optimized word length for the entire algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1998.727023","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design.

This analysis can be important in the design of functional blocks such as data paths in microprocessors, where if noise avoidance is included in the design planning phase, later changes in the design may be avoided. Thus, reducing the number of design iterations and overall design time. The ideal noise calculation technique should be very fast and reasonably accurate so as to account for all significant parameters that will affect the noise. We consider three different techniques and compare them with an exact analysis using a circuit simulator. It is shown that a lumped model is quite accurate for predicting noise on a variety of wire geometries up to 3 mm in length. We also propose a technique to extend this model to the practically important case when bus wires overlap only partially with neighbors.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1998.727026","startPage":"76","endPage":"81","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design.

Two or more 6T SRAM cells are combined together to divide the bit-line into several sub bit-lines. These sub bit-lines are again combined to form two or more levels of hierarchy. This division of bit-line into hierarchical sub bit-lines results in reduction of bit-line capacitance, which reduces active power and access time. Optimum values for number of levels of hierarchy and number of blocks combined at each level have been derived. Experimental results show that the observed parameters and estimated ones follow the same trend. It is shown that the reduction in bit-line capacitance reduces active power consumption by 50-60% and the access time by about 20% at the expense of approximately 5% increase in the number of transistors. This approach is further extended by incorporating the controlled voltage swing on bit-lines. This extension reduces the power consumption by another 20-30%.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15654","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design.

But, Gouraud shading has been used instead of Phong shading because of per pixel computation and hardware costs. However, with continuous improvement of VLSI technologies and request for higher realism, real-time Phong shading will be the next technology-push in 3D graphics. Taylor series approximation is an algorithm of fast Phong shading algorithms that is appropriate for hardware implementation. But, the hardware implementation of this algorithm requires a large ROM table that induces an overhead in terms of hardware size. We reduced this overhead by minimizing the ROM table size while keeping visual quality through visual comparison. We minimized a large ROM table size of a uniform quantization method to 1/64 using an adaptive-compressed non-uniform quantization method. By minimizing the ROM table size, we could minimize the total hardware size to 1/56.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1998.727063","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design.

Previous LOP proposals produce a shift amount which might be in error by one position, so that this error has to be corrected after the addition terminates, increasing the critical path. Our design incorporates a concurrent detection of this error so that the amount of shift is corrected before the actual shift, without increasing the latency. The scheme presented here is applicable to the common case of a single datapath floating-point addition in which the output of the adder is always positive. We estimate the reduction in the critical path and the increase in area.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1998.727065","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design.

The routing resources in the symmetrical-array-based FPGAs consist of segments of various lengths. Researchers have shown that the number of segments, instead of wirelength, used by a net is the most critical factor in controlling routing delay in an FPGA. Thus, traditional measure of routing delay based on the geometric distance of a signal is not accurate. To consider wirelength and delay simultaneously, we study a model of timing-driven routing trees, arising from the special properties of FPGA routing architectures. We explore the complexity of the routing-tree problem and present efficient and effective approximation algorithms for the problem. Based on the solutions to the routing-tree problem, we present a global-routing algorithm which is able to utilize various routing segments with global consideration to meet the timing constraints.

It is shown that these three coefficients are sufficient for the majority of the blocks for motion-compensated low bit-rate video coding. For other blocks, a conventional full-coefficient DCT is employed. Experiments with both low and high complexity sequences show that the content-dependent algorithm reduces the computational load of the DCT by a factor >2/spl times/ without loss in image quality and a factor 4/spl times/, if a slight PSNR loss is acceptable.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

A command specifies, in a few bytes, a request for multiple independent memory words. A command is similar to a burst found in DRAM memories, but does not require the memory words to be consecutive. The command is sent to all sections of the memory array simultaneously, thus not requiring a crossbar in the proper sense. Our simulations show that this command based memory system can improve performance over a traditional SDRAM-based memory system by factors that range between 1.15 up to 1.54. Moreover, in many cases, the command memory system outperforms even the best SRAM memory system under consideration. Overall the command based memory system achieves similar or better results than a 10 ns SRAM memory system (a) using fewer banks and (b) using memory devices that are between 15 to 60 times cheaper.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.1998.727154","startPage":"68","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (Cat.

Visible errors are then weighted, depending on the perceptual importance of the region in which they occur.

In such environments, the processor component of the system is not fully modeled. With wide issue superscalar processors being the norm in today's multiprocessor nodes, there is an urgent need for modeling the processor accurately. However, using direct execution to model a superscalar processor has been considered an open problem. Hence, current approaches model the processor by interpreting the application executable. Unfortunately, this approach can be slow. In this paper, we propose a novel direct-execution framework that allows accurate simulation of wide-issue superscalar processors without the need for code interpretation. This is achieved with the aid of an Interface Window between the front-end and the architectural simulator, that buffers the necessary information. This eliminates the need for full-fledged instruction emulation. Overall, this approach enables detailed yet fast EDS of superscalar processors. Finally, we evaluate the framework and show good performance for uni- and multiprocessor configurations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A direct-execution framework for fast and accurate simulation of superscalar processors","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (Cat.

Because its strategy is to simply minimize the differences between the goal image and the currently obtained image, trajectory of the robot motion cannot be estimated beforehand, and sometimes it results in largely inefficient motion. This paper points out that this inefficient motion is caused by interferences of translation and rotation of images. Then, we propose two algorithms to decouple them by using the homography and the epipolar condition held between the goal image and the current image, and to generate the optimal trajectory of the robot motion to reach the goal straightforwardly.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1998.727274","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

In order to efficiently perform useful tasks such as office delivery, mobile robots must know their position in their environment. Existing approaches can be distinguished according to the type of localization problem they are designed to solve. Tracking techniques aim at monitoring the robot's position. They assume that the position is initially known and cannot recover from situations in which they lost track of the robot's position. Global localization techniques on the other hand, are able to estimate the robot's position under complete uncertainty. We present the dynamic Markov localization technique as a uniform approach to position estimation, which is able (1) to globally estimate the position of the robot, (2) to efficiently track its position whenever the robot's certainty is high, and (3) to detect and recover from localization failures. The approach has been implemented and intensively tested in real-world environments. We present several experiments illustrating the strength of our method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/727279/","accessionNumber":"6168664","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"17-17 Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Integrating global position estimation and position tracking for mobile robots: the dynamic Markov localization approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating global position estimation and position tracking for mobile robots: the dynamic Markov localization approach","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00727279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05964S","chronDate":"13-17 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5876","citationCount":"73","articleId":"727279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":727280,"authors":[{"name":"J.-S.

In this experimental study, we compare two methods for localization of indoor mobile robots: Markov localization, which uses a probability distribution across a grid of robot poses; and scan matching, which uses Kalman filtering techniques based on matching sensor scans. Both these techniques are dense matching methods, that is, they match dense sets of environment features to an a priori map. To arrive at results for a range of situations, we utilize several different types of environments, and add noise to both the dead-reckoning and the sensors. Analysis shows that, roughly, the scan-matching techniques are more efficient and accurate, but Markov localization is better able to cope with large amounts of noise. These results suggest hybrid methods that are efficient, accurate and robust to noise.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experimental comparison of localization methods","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

Of all cooperated tasks between humans and robots, the most important and basic factor is delivery of objects by hand. To insure positive delivery, the robot should open its hand only after making sure that the object has been received by the human. The human releases the object only after confirming that the robot can actually grasp the object stably. The features of the hand-delivery system introduced in the paper include that (1) the robot recognizes successful transfer of the object to a human when the human changes the grasping condition, (2) the human guides the position and orientation of the grasped object to a stable grasp, and (3) the robot, in response to the above guide, regrasps the object to realize a stable grasping condition. The paper introduces evaluation for stable grasp, and presents a new technique for sensor based regrasp manipulation and delivery by hand between a human and robot based on force-torque sensing which reflects the result of stability evaluation. Finally, experimental results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1998.727283","publicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

With content-based systems today, there exists a significant gap between the user's information needs and what the systems can deliver. We propose to bridge this gap, by introducing the novel idea of semantic visual templates (SVT). Each template represents a personalized view of concepts (e.g. slalom, meetings, sunsets, etc.). The SVT is represented using a set of successful queries, which are generated by a two-way interaction between the user and the system. We have developed algorithms that interact with the user and converge upon a small set of exemplar queries that maximize recall. The SVTs emphasize intuitive models that allow for easy manipulation and queries to be composited. The resulting system performs well, for example with small number of queries in the \"sunset\" template, we are able to achieve 50% recall and 24% precision over a large unannotated database.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/727321/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6214710","conferenceDate":"7-7 Oct. 1998","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Semantic visual templates: linking visual features to semantics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic visual templates: linking visual features to semantics","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00727321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058672S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15680","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5852","citationCount":"79","articleId":"727321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":727336,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.K.

As a result, fast motion estimation algorithms, such as three-step-search (TSS) and 2-D log search, have been developed. These fast algorithms try to reduce the computational complexity by limiting the number of locations to be searched, but result in higher mean square error (MSE). In this paper, another fast algorithm is introduced, which shows a better MSE performance and lower computational complexity than TSS. The proposed algorithm employs both search window sub-sampling and object boundary pixel decimation techniques to effectively reduce the computational complexity, while keeping even lower MSE at the same time. There are two versions of the proposed algorithm, providing different computational complexity. In particular, the proposed algorithm requires only 32% to 65% of TSS's computation, or in other words, 3.6% to 7.2% of FS's computation, and the performance is in the mid-way between TSS and FS.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1998.727336","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

Reversible integer wavelet image coders facilitate decompression from low bit rates all the way up to lossless reconstruction. However, in the past, specific implementations of such techniques, like S+P, could not match the lossless compression performance of state-of-the-art predictive coding techniques like CALIC. We demonstrate for the first time that reversible integer wavelets together with proper context modeling can match the lossless compression performance of CALIC. This can be done without increase in the essential complexity over S+P. Our findings present a strong argument for using subband coding as a unified, elegant approach for both lossy and lossless image compression. Specifically, in this paper we outline how to obtain significantly higher coding efficiency over S+P by utilizing better filters and better context modeling and entropy coding of wavelet coefficients.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.1998.727395","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

The algorithm assumes no stationarity of the source. The resulting P2AR predictor can be loosely considered as a universal parametric image model in the sense that no prior knowledge about the image are assumed. The predictor parameters are causal and dynamically adapted to the source, hence suits one-pass image coding with no side information. The good fit of the model to a variety of images is demonstrated by its superior performance when being used in lossless image coding. We reduced the bit rate of the benchmark lossless image codec CALIC by three percent averaging over the JPEG set of test images, simply by replacing the context-sensitive, non-linear GAP predictor of CALIC with the P2AR predictor. The performance margin gets much larger when the source is highly nonstationary. In order to make on-line 2D autoregression computationally feasible, we developed a novel and efficient algorithm for computing and updating covariances of regression variables on a pixel-by-pixel basis. This algorithm can also be applied in image segmentation, texture classification, and other image analysis tasks that require heavy computations of second order statistics.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.1998.727397","publicationTitle":"Proceedings 1998 International Conference on Image Processing.

A major component of the center is a robotic patient positioning system that will carry and position patients in a proton beam. The desired positioning accuracy of the robot is less than 0.5 mm. However, various sources of errors in the robot such as assembly errors or flexible deformation of the robot links result in big end-effector positioning errors. It is important to know these end-effector errors as a function of the robot joint variables and patient weight, to be able to compensate them using the manipulator controller.

An automatic planner generates a serpentine path pattern by repeated and appropriate concatenation of up to five basic motion macros. This nominal path is executed by a Cartesian motion controller. In case of unexpected obstacles the robot updates its internal geometric representation of the work area to be processed and replans its path. Due to obstacle avoidance, certain areas may remain unprocessed. Location and topology of such areas are automatically reconstructed for repeated follow-up floor caring in case of temporary obstacles. For this purpose connecting maneuvres and paths of complete floor coverage are incrementally planned and executed. Landmark localization at automatically preplanned reference points allows online modification of motion commands and guarantees precise long distance path tracking. Feasibility of the developed techniques has been demonstrated in various long-term experiments with the prototype mobile service robot MACROBE.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings. 1998 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems.

The number of degrees-of-freedom (DOF) of the Sensor Arm is seven, which is the same DOF of a human arm. Angle and torque of each joint can be measured. Moreover, in this system, force feedback can be realized at each joint of the human arm. To measure human force a new type of force sensor system is proposed in the Sensor Arm system.

This problem arises because the available features are not sufficient to discriminate the classes. It implies that the fuzzy clusters generated by the input features have rough uncertainty. This paper proposes a fuzzy-rough set based network which exploits fuzzy-rough membership functions to reduce this problem. The proposed network is theoretically a powerful classifier as it is equivalent to a universal approximator. Moreover, its activity is transparent as it can easily be mapped to a Takagi-Sugeno type fuzzy rule base system. The efficacy of the proposed method is studied on a vowel recognition problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/727497/","accessionNumber":"6202104","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-14 Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy-rough neural networks for vowel classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy-rough neural networks for vowel classification","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00727497.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050771S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875","citationCount":"8","articleId":"727497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":727499,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

To evaluate the performance of modular networks, a comparison is made with a global neural network, on the same database. Two basic kind of modular networks are considered: 1) seven expert modular networks in which five of them are provided for digits 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 and the rest for the pair of digits 3-8 and 4-9 respectively; and 2) a modular neural network with an expert module for each feature extracted from the handwritten digit image. The cooperation is among modules extracting slope and radial projection from each digit. Two type of cooperation among modular networks are considered: neural network and weighted combination of the modules outputs. The models were trained and tested on a different set of digits. The results show that by using modular network for features, it is possible to improve classification performance on handwritten digits, from 91.0% in the case of global networks to 93.5% of modular networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1998.727499","pdfPath":"/iel4/5875/15682/00727499.pdf","startPage":"4172","endPage":"4177 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"SMC'98 Conference Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

But their performance, i.e., the recognition rate, depends on a number of factors which may include the network architecture, feature selection, network parameter setting, learning strategy, learning sample selection, test pattern preprocessing, etc. These factors are important to network engineer in designing a network for a particular application problem, but unfortunately there is a lack of systematic way to guide their decision-making regarding the selection of these parameters. This paper presents a parameter tuning (namely the selectivity parameter) methodology based on a sensitivity analysis of the neocognitron model, and the off-line handwritten numeral recognition with supervised learning is chosen to be the demonstrated application problem. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select parameters leading to improved recognition results. We used a set of training pattern provided by Fukushima (1988) as our training patterns which involved no preprocessing, and our experimental results show a significant improvement in performance. A brief discussion on alternate hybrid architecture involving neural network and genetic algorithm, and different fitting functions for the GA will be presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1998.727509","startPage":"4228","endPage":"4233 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"SMC'98 Conference Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

The proposed multi-module neural network (MMNN) is a hierarchical network with cascade connections, and consists of several modules which can detect specific features. MMNN is constructed based on the information processing of the visual nervous system such as a column structure in the Visual Area I and the hierarchical hypothesis of Hubel-Wiesel. As an example of a target object, we deal with human faces detection. This system consists of several modules in parallel which are trained to respond selectively to human face components: the eyes, the nose, and the mouth. Finally, the face area is detected by integrating the outputs of previous a cell layer. We carried out a lot of experiments using 100 images having complex background to conform the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. 83% of faces are detected correctly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/727519/","accessionNumber":"6202126","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-14 Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A visual nervous system based multi-module neural network for object recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A visual nervous system based multi-module neural network for object recognition","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00727519.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033647S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875","citationCount":"1","articleId":"727519","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":727520,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Melodies can be treated as temporal sequences. The multilayer network using complex neurons with local feedback (MNCF) is used in the proposed system because of the high ability to deal with temporal sequences. The process of retrieval is as follows: first, the pitch and duration of each note are extracted from the key melody which is inputted from the MIDI keyboard. Second, they are inputted to some MNCFs. When the output values of each MNCF agree with the next input values for several times, it produces the database address. The user can listen to the candidate of the melody. In addition, the user can know the text information. The proposed system has the following other features: the user can input any parts of the melody he/she remembers as a key input; the human interface is excellent for users. The retrieval is performed in parallel because of the inherent parallelism of neural networks; the proposed system is robust for transposition and change of the tempo. We have evaluated the proposed system by experiment. The system retrieved about 91.5% of melodies correctly.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1998.727520","startPage":"4290","endPage":"4295 vol.5","publicationTitle":"SMC'98 Conference Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

The proposed strategy overcomes any weakness a given classifier may have by changing the classification decision for a given test sample based on the location of the test sample with respect to the misclassified pockets. Three diversely different classifiers and a simple composite classifier are used to test the strategy.

Data compression techniques such as context-based modeling and vector quantization are based on a memoryless or near-memoryless prediction process and suit for the memoryless nature of the stock market data. In this paper, we propose a data compression-based portfolio prediction model hybridized with the fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm. This model exploits the prediction power of the lossy compression techniques such as vector quantization and context-based modeling and applies the prediction to the portfolio theory. In the model, the quantifiable microeconomic stock data are first optimized through the genetic algorithms to generate the most effective microeconomic data in relation to the stock market performance. The nonquantifiable microeconomic data are modeled with the fuzzification process. Then the previous stock market performance with the effective stock data and the fuzzified microeconomic data are processed based on the context-based modeling and vector quantization. Finally, the prediction of the stock market performance with the stock data is defuzzified using the fuzzification model to produce a portfolio performance prediction. The experiment on JF Asean Unit Trust using this portfolio theory model has shown a reliable prediction for the performance of the Trust for the past 5 years.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1998.727522","startPage":"4301","endPage":"4306 vol.5","publicationTitle":"SMC'98 Conference Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

Also, moving objects can be tracked by repeating these processes. For the system to be versatile, it consistently executes these processes and makes no assumption on objects; objects may be any size, any shape (figures, polyhedra to free forms), covered with textured or glossy surfaces, at any position, in any direction, together with other objects, and partially occluded by them. The basic technical approach is structural analysis and partial pattern matching.

This paper puts forth an alternative to the estimation of all-terminal network reliability by using artificial neural network predictive models. Neural networks are constructed, trained and validated using alternative network topologies, a network reliability upper bound and the exact network reliability as a target. A hierarchical approach is used: a general neural network screens all network designs for reliability followed by a specialized neural network for highly reliable network designs. Results on a ten node problem are given using a grouped cross validation approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1998.727600","startPage":"4734","endPage":"4739 vol.5","publicationTitle":"SMC'98 Conference Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

We propose a bandwidth routing algorithm for multimedia support in a multihop wireless network. This network can be interconnected to wired networks (e.g. ATM or the Internet) or stand alone. Our bandwidth routing includes bandwidth calculation and reservation schemes. Under such a routing algorithm, we can derive a route to satisfy the bandwidth requirement for the QoS constraint. At a source node, the bandwidth information can be used to decide to accept a new call or not immediately. This is specially important to carry out a fast handoff when interconnecting to an ATM backbone infrastructure. It enables an efficient call admission control. The simulation results show that the bandwidth routing algorithm is very useful in extending the ATM virtual circuit service to the wireless network. Different types of QoS traffic can be integrated in such a dynamic radio network with high performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/727644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6239798","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1998","displayDocTitle":"QoS routing in ad hoc wireless networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS routing in ad hoc wireless networks","confLoc":"Lowell, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"00727644.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049587S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5874","citationCount":"12","articleId":"727644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":727664,"authors":[{"name":"J.

As networks have become faster, the processing load required for complete packet sampling has also grown. In some cases, for example Gigabit Ethernet, the network can deliver packets faster than a network management subsystem can process them. In order to prevent inaccurate traffic statistics due to \"clipping\" of traffic peaks, Claffy et al. (1993) applied several static sampling strategies to network traffic characterization. As shown in this paper, static sampling may produce inaccurate traffic statistics. Adaptive sampling methods are developed and evaluated to address the inaccuracies of static sampling. In addition, the estimation of the Hurst parameter, a measure of traffic self-similarity, is studied for static and adaptive sampling. It is shown that adaptive sampling results in a more accurate estimation of the mean, variance, and Hurst parameter for packet counts.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.1998.727664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.1998.727664","startPage":"238","endPage":"247","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings 23rd Annual Conference on Local Computer Networks.

The gradient descent method in a multilayer perceptron neural network (NN) is replaced by a GA. The significance of such a refinement is that the refined or tuned parameters will enable the fuzzy expert system (FES) to draw more accurate and reasonable conclusions and reduce the chance of leading to a wrong goal. Furthermore, the time required to repeatedly consult with the domain experts will be reduced.

However, there are many variations on the EKF implementation that can significantly affect its performance. For example, improper initialization of three parameters cause the algorithm to perform poorly. There are also two advanced methods, decoupling and multistreaming, which need to be properly applied based on the specifics of the problem. This paper presents the results of extensive experimentation in applying the EKF training method for recurrent and static neural networks. The goal is to demonstrate how different variations on its implementation effect performance and to find methods to optimize performance. The paper examines the effects of decoupling, multistreaming, and initial values of constants used by the algorithm. Three new ideas are suggested that can lead to improved performance. These ideas are: initializing parameters to values outside the range previously suggested, a new decoupling strategy, and reducing the update rate of the error covariance matrix for faster training.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728124/","accessionNumber":"6181803","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-14 Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Extended Kalman filter neural network training: experimental results and algorithm improvements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended Kalman filter neural network training: experimental results and algorithm improvements","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00728124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028284S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875","citationCount":"8","articleId":"728124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":728125,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In using the filter to train neural networks, the consequence of this problem is both a loss of efficiency during training and an eventual blow up. This problem has long been recognized in the application of the filter in signal processing and several forms of a square root Kalman filter have been derived to overcome it. However, the existing square root Kalman filter algorithms cannot incorporate the learning rate used in neural network training. In many situations, the incorporation of the learning rate into the training algorithms is crucial to obtaining excellent results in training time lagged recurrent neural networks (TLRNN). In this paper, a new square root Kalman filter equation is derived to train TLRNN which allows a user to incorporate the learning rate into the neural network training. With this new square root Kalman filter algorithm, we are able to train a neural network to convergence on a large and complex problem related to misfire diagnostics over a very large number of cycles, to produce extremely high classification accuracy on the diagnostic task. This training proceeded without any training problems we often experienced when a standard Kalman filter training algorithm was used for identical initializations and structures of the network. Furthermore, the neural network trained by the new method outperforms the one trained with the conventional Kalman filter algorithm by almost a factor of two.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1998.728125","pdfPath":"/iel4/5875/15679/00728125.pdf","startPage":"1645","endPage":"1651 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"SMC'98 Conference Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

Classical industrial control techniques allow pneumatic cylinders to position loads to a high degree of accuracy. However, these techniques do not allow for trajectory tracking control because they cannot compensate for the nonlinear nature of the compressed air flow and of the internal friction present in the cylinders. Multilayer neural networks (MNN) can be used to compensate for the nonlinear nature of these dynamic systems. For this study, a MNN was designed to be an inverse model of the cylinder and was used in conjunction with a PID feedback controller for the cylinder motion. An off-line adaptive MNN provides initial training to the controller resulting in the ability to track the desired trajectory. Once the controller has been designed, an online adaptive MNN is used for continued learning as the system dynamics change over time.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1998.728129","pdfPath":"/iel4/5875/15679/00728129.pdf","startPage":"1662","endPage":"1667 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"SMC'98 Conference Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

The approach requires no special converter or sensor circuitry, and does not rely on accurate prior knowledge of the magnetic characteristics of the motor. The technique is based on the use of the main converters to inject short, fixed duration, diagnostic current pulses simultaneously into two unenergised phases of a four-phase SRM. Previously, such a technique has been used to estimate the inductance of the motor phase windings and, using stored knowledge of the relationship between inductance L, rotor position /spl theta/, and current i, to estimate rotor position. The approach described in this paper is novel in two respects. Firstly, it does not rely on prior knowledge of the function L(/spl theta/) but merely makes the assumption that L varies substantially as sin(N/sub r//spl theta/), where N/sub r/ is the number of rotor poles. Secondly, the approach learns from good estimates of position and, once it has done this, is able to use this knowledge where performance of the estimation algorithm degrades (principally at low speeds of rotation).","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1998.728151","startPage":"1774","endPage":"1778 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"SMC'98 Conference Proceedings. 1998 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (Cat.

The CSNN model is based on a system of ordinary differential equations, motivated by Volterra and Lotka's models of interacting species in biology. The CSNN features a continuous time system dynamics that is free of auxiliary control mechanisms, complex hard threshold switching functions, or LUT based approaches found in conventional pattern processing. These characteristics are essential for establishing self-organizing properties in unsupervised nets. Due to inherent complexities, attempts to analyze properties and capabilities of this system for pattern processing still remains a challenging task. Research rarely extends beyond the study of system stability, and other issues are essential for characterizing system properties and solution curves of their dynamics. The paper develops a self-organizing scheme for unsupervised neural networks, whose self-organizing properties are implicitly coded within a trajectory structure defined only by ordinary differential equations. The dynamic behavior is well understood and characterized using only the conventional analytical tools in mathematics. The constructed dynamics realizes a fixed finite set of equilibria in any fixed finite dimensional space. The /spl omega/-limit set of all trajectories initiated in its state space is the union of the stored pattern categories, represented as asymptotically stable limit points.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728157/","accessionNumber":"6189398","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-14 Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A biologically based competition model for self-organizing neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A biologically based competition model for self-organizing neural networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00728157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054919S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875","articleId":"728157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":728158,"authors":[{"name":"H.J.

This control method enables a plant to operate smoothly under various conditions. We focuses on the temperature control for a chemical plant which produces polyethylene in a batch reactor. Here, the reaction in a tank is complex and has many nonlinear factors. The temperature control is realized by valves manipulation. Since the valve control have been performed by using a conventional PID controller, it generally needs much effort and time to tune the PID gains. Thus, in the production field, a new control system with a cheap and simple structure is needed to tune PID gains without operator's decision under various conditions of the plant. For that purpose, we use the self-tuning neural-PID control method which has the characteristic of tuning PID gains automatically by neural networks. From the experiment results, we show the effectiveness of the proposal method to improve the control performance of the temperature in the batch reactor.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728186/","accessionNumber":"6189427","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-14 Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Skill-based PID control by using neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skill-based PID control by using neural networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00728186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02842S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875","citationCount":"5","articleId":"728186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":728199,"authors":[{"name":"N.N.

This procedure solves the damped Gilbert equation for a continuous magnetic medium, including all interactions in standard micromagnetic theory in three-dimensional regions of arbitrary geometry and physical properties. The magnetization is linearly interpolated in each tetrahedral element in a finite element mesh from its value on the nodes, and the Galerkin method is used to discretize the dynamic equation. We compute the demagnetizing field by solution of Poisson's equation and treat the external region by means of an asymptotic boundary condition. The procedure is implemented in the general purpose dynamical micromagnetic code (GDM). GDM uses a backward differential formula to solve the stiff ordinary differential equations system and the generalized minimum residual method with an incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient preconditioner to solve the linear equations. GDM is fully parallelized using MPI and runs on massively parallel processor supercomputers, clusters of workstations, and single processor computers. We have successfully applied GDM to studies of the switching processes in isolated prolate ellipsoidal particles and in a system of multiple particles.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamical micromagnetics by the finite element method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.728293","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel4/20/15701/00728293.pdf","startPage":"3842","endPage":"3852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.728293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728293/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Dynamical micromagnetics by the finite element method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6107759","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamical micromagnetics by the finite element method","sourcePdf":"00728293.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061613S","chronDate":"Nov.  1998","isNumber":"15701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"43","articleId":"728293","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":728294,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.H.

To remove this bias, the mounting errors must be compensated first before using the Kalman filter. It is shown that only the projection part of the sensors errors in the measurement space needs to be compensated. If the state of a system is unavailable, a neuro-fuzzy network can be used to estimate the compensation term. This method is simpler, as it does not require a model for the errors as proposed by Hall et al. (1983). A sub-optimal Kalman filter with measurement compensation that restrains each row of the Kalman gain matrix to be in the measurement space is also derived. An example is presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["State estimation","Measurement errors","Neural networks","Sensor systems","Extraterrestrial measurements","Covariance matrix","Mechanical sensors","Gain measurement","Fault detection","Hydraulic actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state estimation","error compensation","fuzzy neural nets","linear systems","discrete time systems","Kalman filters","measurement errors","sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["measurement error compensation","sensor mounting error","Kalman filter","state estimation","fuzzy neural network","Kalman gain matrix","redundant sensors","linear systems","discrete time systems"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCA.1998.728315","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (Cat.

An approach is proposed that involves the modeling of an alternative relationship and an a priori knowledge from which the unmeasured variable may be determined. To effect this, a recurrent neural network is trained that predicts a measurable variable. Furthermore, a mathematical relationship that determines the unmeasured variable based on the prediction and a knowledge from the physical insight is established. The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is adopted to estimate the unmeasured variable online. A simulation model of a process analyzer, whose purpose is to estimate ammonium concentration in wastewater, is considered to demonstrate the approach. The estimation of the ammonium concentration is based on the prediction error between the output of an off-line trained recurrent network and a measured ammonia concentration. Furthermore, a knowledge about the relationship between the unmeasured and measured input variables with regard to their effect on the output variable is incorporated in the estimation algorithm. A calibration procedure is carried out to gain training data for the neural network.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1998.728317","startPage":"163","endPage":"167 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1998 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications (Cat.

These are nonlinear systems that present undesirable oscillations during the motion, especially at arrival. The paper presents a self-tuning controller based on neural networks for the anti-swing control problem of the crane. The scheme of the controller is based on using neural networks as self-tuners for the parameters of a state feedback controller. The aim of this approach is to take advantage of the ability to learn of the neural networks and to use them in place of an identifier in the conventional self-tuner scheme. One of the main advantages of this method is that the training of the networks is done online using a backpropagation algorithm. The algorithm was implemented and tested by means of different simulations carried out with the crane.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728318/","accessionNumber":"6128274","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-4 Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of a neural network based self-tuning controller for an overhead crane","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a neural network based self-tuning controller for an overhead crane","confLoc":"Trieste, Italy","sourcePdf":"00728318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053477S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1998","isNumber":"15692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5844","citationCount":"11","articleId":"728318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":728319,"authors":[{"name":"Yongji Wang","affiliation":["Process Control Group, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Dortmund, Germany"],"lastName":"Yongji Wang","id":"37087154411"},{"name":"G.

A circuit composed of a voltage-source half-bridge inverter, a distributed constant line and a parallel LC resonant circuit has been developed for this purpose. The high-intensity discharge (HID) lamp is connected to the output terminal of the inverter through the distributed constant line. Here, since the length of the line is adjusted to 1/4 of the propagation wavelength /spl lambda/ (/spl lambda//4 condition), the output voltage of the voltage-source inverter can be converted to a current source on the load side. Therefore, the ballast can supply not only high voltage to the HID lamp for initiating discharge, but also stable current to it during discharge condition. The modification of the proposed circuit is also proposed in order to expand the operating frequency without increasing the undesirable harmonic current.

Limitations in the randomly switched DC-DC converters, which have not been addressed before, are highlighted. Randomized schemes generally have inherent problems in achieving low-output-voltage ripple due to the low-frequency continuous noise within the passband of the converter filter. The inherent low-frequency noise-induced voltage ripple problems of nondeterministic switching methods for DC converters are confirmed experimentally.

The proposed filter is shown to effectively reduce both the differential and common modes dv/dt at the motor terminals, even in the presence of long motor leads. Reducing differential mode dv/dt reduces overvoltages at the motor terminals and lowers the stress on the motor insulation. Lowering common mode dv/dt is shown to significantly reduce high-frequency leakage currents to ground and induced shaft voltage in the motor. An important advantage of the approach is that the filter can be installed within the inverter enclosure to achieve both the differential and common modes dv/dt reductions at the motor terminals. Thus, the use of the filter can contribute to enhanced bearing life and improve reliability of PWM drive systems. Analysis, design equations, and experimental results on a 480-V 20-hp PWM drive system are presented.

To predict these faults, a new method to set a predictive maintenance is presented and tested on two types of converters. The best indicator of fault of the output filter capacitors is the increase of ESR (equivalent series resistance). The output-voltage ripple /spl Delta/V/sub o/ of the converter increases with respect to ESR. In order to avoid errors due to load variations, /spl Delta/V/sub o/ is filtered at the switching frequency of the converter. The problem is that this filtered component is not only dependent on the aging of the capacitors, but also on the ambient temperature, output current, and input voltage of the converter. Thus, to predict the failure of the capacitors, this component is processed with these parameters and the remaining time before failure is deduced. Software was developed to establish predictive maintenance of the converter. The method developed is as follows. First, a reference system including all the converter parameters was built for the converter at its sound state, i.e., using sound electrolytic filter capacitors. Then, all these parameters were processed and compared on line to the reference system, thereby, the lifetime of these capacitors was computed.","doi":"10.1109/63.728347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/63/15700/00728347.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.728347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15700","startPage":"1199","endPage":"1207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Failure prediction of electrolytic capacitors during operation of a switchmode power supply","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Failure prediction of electrolytic capacitors during operation of a switchmode power supply","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728347/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6094145","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Failure prediction of electrolytic capacitors during operation of a switchmode power supply","sourcePdf":"00728347.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026709S","chronDate":"Nov.  1998","isNumber":"15700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"260","articleId":"728347","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":728348,"authors":[{"name":"P.E.

It was found that the device temperature evolution in time is ruled by an infinite and convergent series of time constants. The knowledge of the first n terms of the time-constant spectrum obtained from the temperature transient measurements allows the complete characterization of a suitable and reliable equivalent thermal circuit structured as a Cauer low-pass network with n cells. The total thermal resistance is therefore evaluated as a sum of several contributions due to given parts of the whole system. The techniques allowing the physical identifications of these contributions are also discussed. Furthermore, the influence of plastic coverage on the device thermal behavior is taken into account. The proposed characterization method is also applied to one-dimensional (1-D) multilayered simulated structures in order to study the influence of the number of time constants used for the analysis and effects of local defects or modifications of the material thermal properties.","doi":"10.1109/63.728348","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel4/63/15700/00728348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.728348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15700","startPage":"1208","endPage":"1219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal resistance analysis by induced transient (TRAIT) method for power electronic devices thermal characterization.

The ADT taxonomy for categorizing such techniques was proposed in 1995 to provide a basis for the systematic comparison of the different approaches. This paper shows that not only is this taxonomy applicable to a cross section of current techniques for extracting rules from trained feedforward ANN's but also how the taxonomy can be adapted and extended to embrace a broader range of ANN types (e,g., recurrent neural networks) and explanation structures. In addition we identify some of the key research questions in extracting the knowledge embedded within ANN's including the need for the formulation of a consistent theoretical basis for what has been, until recently, a disparate collection of empirical results.","doi":"10.1109/72.728352","startPage":"1057","endPage":"1068","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15696/00728352.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.728352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The truth will come to light: directions and challenges in extracting the knowledge embedded within trained artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Taxonomy","Recurrent neural networks","Intelligent networks","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Automata","Fuzzy neural networks","Pattern recognition","Function approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","recurrent neural nets","knowledge acquisition","finite automata","explanation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural networks","ADT taxonomy","rule extraction","knowledge acquisition","explanation structures","finite state automata","fuzzy neural networks","knowledge insertion","recurrent neural networks","rule refinement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1998","displayDocTitle":"The truth will come to light: directions and challenges in extracting the knowledge embedded within trained artificial neural networks","volume":"9","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6101372","pubMedId":"18255792","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The truth will come to light: directions and challenges in extracting the knowledge embedded within trained artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00728352.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112082S","chronDate":"Nov.  1998","isNumber":"15696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"265","articleId":"728352","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":728353,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Two simplified TMLN models are also presented, and show that a multilayer neural network made up of triple-valued or multiple-valued logic neurons (TMLNN) can implement a triple-valued or multiple-valued logic inference system. The training algorithm for TMLNN is presented and can be shown to converge. In our model, triple-valued or multiple-valued logic rules can be extracted from TMLNN with ease.

The maximum weight and fan-in values are in the order of O(n). Under the same assumptions on weight and fan-in values, an asymptotic bound of O(log n) for both size and depth of the network is also derived for symmetric Boolean functions that can be decomposed into a constant number of periodic symmetric Boolean subfunctions. Based on this results neural networks for serial binary addition and multiplication of n-bit operands are also proposed. It is shown that the serial addition can be computed with polynomially bounded weights and a maximum fan-in in the order of O(log n) in O(n/log n) serial cycles.

Closed form expressions of the asymptotic covariance of the projection matrix estimated by the SNL algorithm, and by the smoothed SNL algorithm that we introduce, are given in the case of independent or correlated learning patterns and are further analyzed. It is found that the structures of these asymptotic covariance matrices are similar to those describing batch estimation techniques. The accuracy or our asymptotic analysis is checked by numerical simulations and it is found to be valid not only for a \"small\" learning rate but in a very large domain.

A certain number of time slots in a frame are allocated to voice and the rest are used to transmit data. Maximum data throughput can be achieved by searching for the optimal configuration(s) of relative positions of voice and data transmissions in a frame (frame pattern). When the problem size becomes large, the computational complexity in searching for the optimal patterns becomes intractable. In the paper, mean field annealing (MFA), which provides near-optimal solutions with reasonable complexity, is proposed to solve this problem. The determination of the related parameters are addressed. Comparison with the random search and simulated annealing algorithm is made in terms of solution optimality and computational complexity.

Criticism of these approaches includes the tendency of the Hopfield network to produce infeasible solutions, and the lack of generalizability of the self-organizing approaches (being only applicable to Euclidean problems). The paper proposes two new techniques which have overcome these pitfalls: a Hopfield network which enables feasibility of the solutions to be ensured and improved solution quality through escape from local minima, and a self-organizing neural network which generalizes to solve a broad class of combinatorial optimization problems. Two sample practical optimization problems from Australian industry are then used to test the performances of the neural techniques against more traditional heuristic solutions.","doi":"10.1109/72.728380","startPage":"1301","endPage":"1318","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15696/00728380.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.728380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural techniques for combinatorial optimization with applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Australia","Hopfield neural networks","Traveling salesman problems","Testing","Performance evaluation","Assembly","Mathematics","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation","combinatorial mathematics","computational complexity","Hopfield neural nets","self-organising feature maps","assembling","production control","neural net architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural techniques","NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems","infeasible solutions","generalizability","solution quality","Australian industry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728380/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Neural techniques for combinatorial optimization with applications","volume":"9","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6101390","pubMedId":"18255811","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural techniques for combinatorial optimization with applications","sourcePdf":"00728380.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03985S","chronDate":"Nov.  1998","isNumber":"15696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"92","articleId":"728380","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":728383,"authors":[{"name":"Youshen Xia","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Youshen Xia","id":"37087166562"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Jun Wang","id":"37087146257"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"728383","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":182,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":533},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Design optimization","Neural networks","Gradient methods","Optimization methods","Signal processing algorithms","Linear programming","Computer networks","Application software","Function approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","gradient methods","optimisation","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general design methodology","globally convergent optimization neural networks","gradient methods","nongradient methods"]}],"abstract":"We present a general methodology for designing optimization neural networks.

The behavior of v/sub t/* over time is completely unpredictable, Random noises act on the dynamic system and the state observation channel, which may be nonlinear. It is assumed that all such random vectors are mutually independent, and that their probability density functions are known. So general a non-LQG optimal control problem is very difficult to solve. The proposed solution is based on three main approximating assumptions: 1) the problem is stated in a receding-horizon framework where v/sub t/* is assumed to remain constant within a shifting-time window; 2) the control law is assigned a given structure (that of a multilayer feedforward neural net) in which a finite number of parameters have to be determined so as to minimize the cost function; and 3) the control law is given a limited memory, which prevents the amount of data to be stored from increasing over time. Errors resulting from the second and third assumptions are discussed, Due to the very general assumptions under which the control law is derived, we are not able to report stability results. However, simulation results show that the proposed method may constitute an effective tool for solving, to a sufficient degree of accuracy, a wide class of control problems traditionally regarded as difficult ones. An example of freeway traffic optimal control is given.","doi":"10.1109/72.728390","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"1388","endPage":"1408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15696/00728390.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.728390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural approximations for infinite-horizon optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Cost function","Multi-layer neural network","Traffic control","Feedback control","Drives","Control systems","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Probability density function","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear control systems","stochastic systems","optimal control","neurocontrollers","feedback","random noise","discrete time systems","minimisation","multilayer perceptrons","feedforward neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural approximations","infinite-horizon optimal control","nonlinear stochastic systems","feedback control law","discrete-time dynamic system","cost function minimization","unpredictable behavior","random noises","dynamic system","nonlinear state observation channel","probability density functions","non-LQG optimal control problem","receding-horizon framework","shifting-time window","multilayer feedforward neural net","stability results","freeway traffic optimal control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Neural approximations for infinite-horizon optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems","volume":"9","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6101408","pubMedId":"18255818","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728390/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural approximations for infinite-horizon optimal control of nonlinear stochastic systems","sourcePdf":"00728390.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06232S","chronDate":"Nov.  1998","isNumber":"15696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"42","articleId":"728390","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":728391,"authors":[{"name":"Shouling He","affiliation":["BMW AG, Munchen, Germany"],"lastName":"Shouling He","id":"37279981900"},{"name":"K.

The basic idea is to first split the complicated task, in both feature and temporal domains, into several much simpler subtasks involving subsyllable and tone discrimination, and then to use two weighting RNN's to generate several dynamic weighting functions to integrate the subsolutions into a complete solution. The novelty of the proposed method lies mainly in the use of appropriate a priori linguistic knowledge of simple initial-final structures of Mandarin syllables in the architecture design of the MRNN. The resulting MRNN is therefore effective and efficient in discriminating among highly confusable Mandarin syllables. Thus both the time-alignment and scaling problems of the ANN-based approach for large-vocabulary speech-recognition can be addressed. Experimental results show that the proposed method and its extensions, the reverse-time MRNN (Rev-MRNN) and bidirection MRNN (Bi-MRNN), all outperform an advanced HMM method trained with the MCE/GPD algorithm in both recognition-rate and system complexity.","doi":"10.1109/72.728393","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15696/00728393.pdf","startPage":"1430","endPage":"1441","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.728393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modular recurrent neural networks for Mandarin syllable recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728393/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1998","displayDocTitle":"Modular recurrent neural networks for Mandarin syllable recognition","volume":"9","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6101409","pubMedId":"18255821","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modular recurrent neural networks for Mandarin syllable recognition","sourcePdf":"00728393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055436S","chronDate":"Nov.  1998","isNumber":"15696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"7","articleId":"728393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":728394,"authors":[{"name":"Cheolwoo You","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Cheolwoo You","id":"37087150641"},{"name":"Daesik Hong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Daesik Hong","id":"37087150887"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"728394","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":67,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":542},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Finite impulse response filter","Iterative algorithms","Cost function","Estimation error","Multilayer perceptrons","Nonlinear filters","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Constellation diagram","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature amplitude modulation","feedforward neural nets","multilayer perceptrons","blind equalisers","Gaussian processes","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear blind equalization schemes","complex-valued multilayer feedforward neural networks","complex-valued multilayer perceptron","complex-valued activation function","QAM signals","correlation coefficient","Gaussian random variables"]}],"doi":"10.1109/72.728394","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15696/00728394.pdf","startPage":"1442","endPage":"1455","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.728394","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear blind equalization schemes using complex-valued multilayer feedforward neural networks","abstract":"Among the useful blind equalization algorithms, stochastic-gradient iterative equalization schemes are based on minimizing a nonconvex and nonlinear cost function. However, as they use a linear FIR filter with a convex decision region, their residual estimation error is high. In the paper, four nonlinear blind equalization schemes that employ a complex-valued multilayer perceptron instead of the linear filter are proposed and their learning algorithms are derived. After the important properties that a suitable complex-valued activation function must possess are discussed, a new complex-valued activation function is developed for the proposed schemes to deal with QAM signals of any constellation sizes. It has been further proven that by the nonlinear transformation of the proposed function, the correlation coefficient between the real and imaginary parts of input data decreases when they are jointly Gaussian random variables. Last, the effectiveness of the proposed schemes is verified in terms of initial convergence speed and MSE in the steady state.

The short-term history is decomposed into the lower scales of wavelet coefficients, which are utilized for detailed analysis and prediction, while the long-term history is decomposed into higher scales of wavelet coefficients that are used for the analysis and prediction of slow trends in the time series. These coordinated scales of time and frequency provide an interpretation of the series structures, and more information about the history of the series, using fewer coefficients than other methods. Results concerning scales of time and frequencies are combined by another expert perceptron, which learns the weight of each scale in the goal-prediction of the original time series. Each network is trained by backpropagation. The weights and biases are initialized by a clustering algorithm of the temporal patterns of the time series, which improves the prediction results as compared to random initialization.

The cooperative action of these networks depends on the topology of interconnections, both feedforward and recurrent ones. This paper shows that it is possible to consider a distinct general architectural solution for all recurrent computations of any given order. The Gabor-like impulse response of a second-order network is analyzed in detail, pointing out how a near-optimal filtering behavior in space and frequency domains can be achieved through excitatory/inhibitory interactions without impairing the stability of the system. These architectures can be mapped, very efficiently at transistor level, on VLSI structures operating as analog perceptual engines. The problem of hardware implementation of early vision tasks can, indeed, be tackled by combining these perceptual agents through suitable weighted sums. A 17-node analog current-mode VLSI circuit has been implemented on a CMOS 2 /spl mu/m, NWELL, single-poly, and double-metal technology, to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. Applications of the perceptual engine to various machine vision algorithms are proposed.","doi":"10.1109/72.728397","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15696/00728397.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.728397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15696","startPage":"1483","endPage":"1494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog VLSI circuits as physical structures for perception in early visual tasks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analog VLSI circuits as physical structures for perception in early visual tasks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728397/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6101401","pubMedId":"18255825","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog VLSI circuits as physical structures for perception in early visual tasks","sourcePdf":"00728397.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05102S","chronDate":"Nov.  1998","isNumber":"15696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"22","articleId":"728397","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":728398,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Experimental results confirm the attractiveness of this technique for exploratory data analysis and an empirical comparison is made with the recently proposed generative topographic mapping (GTM) and standard principal component analysis (PCA). Based on standard probability density models a generic nonlinearity is developed which allows both (1) identification and visualization of dichotomised clusters inherent in the observed data and (2) separation of sources with arbitrary distributions from mixtures, whose dimensionality may be greater than that of number of sources. The resulting algorithm is therefore also a generalized neural approach to independent component analysis (ICA) and it is considered to be a promising method for analysis of real-world data that will consist of sub- and super-Gaussian components such as biomedical signals.","doi":"10.1109/72.728398","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/15696/00728398.pdf","startPage":"1495","endPage":"1501","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.728398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A common neural-network model for unsupervised exploratory data analysis and independent component analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1998","displayDocTitle":"A common neural-network model for unsupervised exploratory data analysis and independent component analysis","volume":"9","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6101402","pubMedId":"18255826","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A common neural-network model for unsupervised exploratory data analysis and independent component analysis","sourcePdf":"00728398.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03507S","chronDate":"Nov.  1998","isNumber":"15696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"16","articleId":"728398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":728399,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A time/code division multiple access protocol is adopted for conflict-free communications, where packets are transmitted in repetition of fixed-length time-slots with specific codes. GNN seeks the time-slot/code assignment with the minimum number of time-slots subject to two constraints: (1) the number of codes must not exceed its upper limit and (2) any couple of links within conflict distance must not be assigned to the same time-slot/code pair. The restricted problem for only one code is known to be NP-complete. The performance of GNN is verified through solving 3000 instances with 100-500 nodes and 100-1000 links.

However, in comparison with the traditional block motion compensation (BMC), its complexity of motion estimation increases significantly due to the interdependency of motion vectors. In this work, a new fast motion estimation algorithm is proposed for OBMC based on the checkerboard block partitioning and grouping in encoding. This algorithm, called the grouped OBMC (GOBMC), effectively decorrelates dependency among OBMC motion vectors and facilitates the search process. In comparison with traditional iterative OBMC motion search, GOBMC performs motion estimation only once per macroblock at the encoder, and reaches a local optimal solution with degradation of 0.05-0.1 dB. At the decoding end, we also propose a fast OBMC reconstruction scheme which reduces the complexity of multiplication to 38% of that of traditional OBMC reconstruction while preserving the same visual quality as obtained via BMC search with OBMC reconstruction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast overlapped block motion compensation with checkerboard block partitioning","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.728412","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/15695/00728412.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"712","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.728412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15695","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728412/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Fast overlapped block motion compensation with checkerboard block partitioning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6094683","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast overlapped block motion compensation with checkerboard block partitioning","sourcePdf":"00728412.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039438S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"10","articleId":"728412","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":728416,"authors":[{"name":"Seongsoo Lee","affiliation":["Inter University semiconductor Research Center, Seoul National Polytechnic University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seongsoo Lee","id":"38185731500"},{"name":"Jeong-Min Kim","affiliation":["Inter University semiconductor Research Center, Seoul National Polytechnic University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jeong-Min Kim","id":"37351548100"},{"name":"Suo-Ik Chae","affiliation":["Inter University semiconductor Research Center, Seoul National Polytechnic University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Suo-Ik Chae","id":"37274400900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1051-8215"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2205"}],"articleNumber":"728416","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":168},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New motion estimation algorithm using adaptively quantized low bit-resolution image and its VLSI architecture for MPEG2 video encoding","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/15695/00728416.pdf","startPage":"734","endPage":"744","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.728416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15695","doi":"10.1109/76.728416","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Hardware","Costs","Pixel","Very large scale integration","CMOS technology","Image generation","Quantization","Image resolution","Dynamic range"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","code standards","telecommunication standards","VLSI","CMOS digital integrated circuits","digital signal processing chips","motion estimation","image resolution","adaptive signal processing","quantisation (signal)","image matching","search problems","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation algorithm","pixel values","VLSI architecture","MPEG2 video encoding","hardware implementation","hardware cost reduction","adaptive quantization","block matching","low bit-resolution image generation","bit resolution reduction","low-resolution search","motion vectors","full-resolution search","peak signal-to-noise ratio","4:1 alternate subsampling","prediction modes","MPEG2 video standard","search range","triple-metal CMOS technology","random logic","SRAM","die size","encoder chip","0.5 micron"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728416","abstract":"This paper describes a new motion estimation algorithm that is suitable for hardware implementation and substantially reduces the hardware cost by using a low bit-resolution image in the block matching. In the low bit-resolution image generation, adaptive quantization is employed to reduce the bit resolution of the pixel values, which is better than simple truncation of the least significant bits in preserving the dynamic range of the pixel values. The proposed algorithm consists of two search steps: in the low-resolution search, a set of candidate motion vectors is determined, and in the full-resolution search, the motion vector is found from these candidate motion vectors. The hardware cost of the proposed algorithm is 1/17 times of the full search algorithm, while its peak signal-to-noise ratio is better than that of the 4:1 alternate subsampling for the search range of /spl plusmn/32/spl times//spl plusmn/32. A VLSI architecture of the proposed algorithm is also described, which can concurrently perform two prediction modes of the MPEG2 video standard with the search range of (-32.0,-32.0)-(+31.5,+31.5).

Unlike conventional modeling where a single model is used to describe the global behavior of a system, TSK modeling is essentially a multimodel approach in which simple submodels (typically linear models) are combined to describe the global behavior of the system. Most existing learning algorithms for identifying the TSK model are based on minimizing the square of the residual between the overall outputs of the real system and the identified model. Although these algorithms can generate a TSK model with good global performance (i.e., the model is capable of approximating the given system with arbitrary accuracy, provided that sufficient rules are used and sufficient training data are available), they cannot guarantee the resulting model to have a good local performance. Often, the submodels in the TSK model may exhibit an erratic local behavior, which is difficult to interpret. Since one of the important motivations of using the TSK model (also other fuzzy models) is to gain insights into the model, it is important to investigate the interpretability issue of the TSK model. We propose a new learning algorithm that integrates global learning and local learning in a single algorithmic framework. This algorithm uses the idea of local weighed regression and local approximation in nonparametric statistics, but remains the component of global fitting in the existing learning algorithms. The algorithm is capable of adjusting its parameters based on the user's preference, generating models with good tradeoff in terms of global fitting and local interpretation. We illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm using a motorcycle crash modeling example.","doi":"10.1109/91.728447","startPage":"530","endPage":"537","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.728447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15694","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/15694/00728447.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the interpretability of TSK fuzzy models by combining global learning and local learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728447/","displayDocTitle":"Improving the interpretability of TSK fuzzy models by combining global learning and local learning","volume":"6","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6094970","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the interpretability of TSK fuzzy models by combining global learning and local learning","sourcePdf":"00728447.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047764S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"230","articleId":"728447","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":728449,"authors":[{"name":"Bor-Sen Chen","affiliation":["Control and Signal Processing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Bor-Sen Chen","id":"37280633300"},{"name":"Huey-Jian Uang","affiliation":["Control and Signal Processing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Huey-Jian Uang","id":"37329523300"},{"name":"Chung-Shi Tseng","affiliation":["Control and Signal Processing Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chung-Shi Tseng","id":"37275611600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"728449","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":103,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":575},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Robots","Minimax techniques","DC motors","Control design","Fuzzy control","Uncertainty","Robust control","Programmable control","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robot dynamics","electric motors","tracking","robust control","game theory","fuzzy control","minimax techniques","optimal control","control system synthesis","model reference adaptive control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust tracking control design","motor dynamics","fuzzy-based dynamic game approach","parameter perturbation","external disturbance","adaptive fuzzy cancellation technique","minimax controller","system uncertainties","linear nominal robotic control design","model reference tracking","eigenvalue assignment","fuzzy logic system","nonlinear uncertainties","tracking robustness","minimax control scheme","optimal attenuation","worst-case effect","fuzzy cancellation","minimax tracking performance","two-link robotic manipulator","DC motors"]}],"abstract":"A robust tracking control design of robot systems including motor dynamics with parameter perturbation and external disturbance is proposed in this study via adaptive fuzzy cancellation technique. A minimax controller equipped with a fuzzy-based scheme is used to enhance the tracking performance in spite of system uncertainties and external disturbance. The design procedure is divided into three steps. At first, a linear nominal robotic control design is obtained via model reference tracking with desired eigenvalue assignment. Next, a fuzzy logic system is constructed and then tuned to eliminate the nonlinear uncertainties as possibly as it can to enhance the tracking robustness. Finally, a minimax control scheme is specified to optimally attenuate the worst-case effect of both the residue due to fuzzy cancellation and external disturbance to achieve a minimax tracking performance. In addition, an adaptive fuzzy-based dynamic game theory is introduced to solve the minimax tracking problem. The proposed method is appropriate for the robust tracking design of robotic systems with large parameter perturbation and external disturbance. A simulation example of a two-link robotic manipulator driven by DC motors is also given to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed design method's tracking performance.","doi":"10.1109/91.728449","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/15694/00728449.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.728449","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust tracking enhancement of robot systems including motor dynamics: a fuzzy-based dynamic game approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728449/","displayDocTitle":"Robust tracking enhancement of robot systems including motor dynamics: a fuzzy-based dynamic game approach","volume":"6","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6094971","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust tracking enhancement of robot systems including motor dynamics: a fuzzy-based dynamic game approach","sourcePdf":"00728449.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038081S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"103","articleId":"728449","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":728456,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Ying","affiliation":["Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Biomedical Engineering Center, Medical Branch, University of Technology, Galveston, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Hao Ying","id":"37271240400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"728456","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":161,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":666},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728456","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Takagi-Sugeno model","Fuzzy systems","Fuzzy control","Fuzzy sets","Context modeling","Sufficient conditions","Biomedical engineering","Medical control systems","Control system synthesis","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","approximation theory","modelling","fuzzy systems","polynomial approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SISO Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems","linear rule consequent","universal approximators","TS fuzzy systems","fuzzy controllers","approximation accuracy","systems configuration","continuous input fuzzy sets","generalized defuzzifier","centroid defuzzifier","Weierstrass approximation theorem","continuous function","minimal upper bound","input fuzzy sets","input fuzzy rules"]}],"doi":"10.1109/91.728456","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/15694/00728456.pdf","startPage":"582","endPage":"587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.728456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15694","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General SISO Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems with linear rule consequent are universal approximators","abstract":"Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy systems have been employed as fuzzy controllers and fuzzy models in successfully solving difficult control and modeling problems in practice. Virtually all the TS fuzzy systems use linear rule consequent. At present, there exist no results (qualitative or quantitative) to answer the fundamentally important question that is especially critical to TS fuzzy systems as fuzzy controllers and models, \"Are TS fuzzy systems with linear rule consequent universal approximators?\" If the answer is yes, then how can they be constructed to achieve prespecified approximation accuracy and what are the sufficient renditions on systems configuration? In this paper, we provide answers to these questions for a general class of single-input single-output (SISO) fuzzy systems that use any type of continuous input fuzzy sets, TS fuzzy rules with linear consequent and a generalized defuzzifier containing the widely used centroid defuzzifier as a special case. We first constructively prove that this general class of SISO TS fuzzy systems can uniformly approximate any polynomial arbitrarily well and then prove, by utilizing the Weierstrass approximation theorem, that the general TS fuzzy systems can uniformly approximate any continuous function with arbitrarily high precision. Furthermore, we have derived a formula as part of sufficient conditions for the fuzzy approximation that can compute the minimal upper bound on the number of input fuzzy sets and rules needed for any given continuous function and prespecified approximation error bound, An illustrative numerical example is provided.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728456/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","volume":"6","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"6094974","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"General SISO Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems with linear rule consequent are universal approximators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General SISO Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems with linear rule consequent are universal approximators","sourcePdf":"00728456.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032735S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"161","articleId":"728456","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":728458,"authors":[{"name":"Euntai Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Euntai Kim","id":"37087253258"},{"name":"Minkee Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Minkee Park","id":"37087348684"},{"name":"Seungwoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Soonchunyang University, ChungNam, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seungwoo Kim","id":"37087197616"},{"name":"Mignon Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Seoul National Polytechnic University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Mignon Park","id":"37087211530"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6706"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0034"}],"articleNumber":"728458","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper presents an explanation of a fuzzy model considering the correlation among components of input data. Generally, fuzzy models have a capability of dividing an input space into several subspaces compared to a linear model. But hitherto suggested fuzzy modeling algorithms have not taken into consideration the correlation among components of sample data and have addressed them independently, which results in an ineffective partition of the input space. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a new fuzzy modeling algorithm, which partitions the input space more effectively than conventional fuzzy modeling algorithms by taking into consideration the correlation among components of sample data. As a way to use the correlation and divide the input space, the method of principal component is used. Finally, the results of the computer simulation are given to demonstrate the validity of this algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partitioning algorithms","Fuzzy systems","Humans","Computer simulation","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Input variables","Covariance matrix","Microwave integrated circuits","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy systems","correlation theory","modelling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transformed input-domain approach","fuzzy modeling","sample data component correlation","input space partitioning","principal component analysis","PCA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/91.728458","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/91/15694/00728458.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/91.728458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A transformed input-domain approach to fuzzy modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A transformed input-domain approach to fuzzy modeling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728458/","volume":"6","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6094976","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A transformed input-domain approach to fuzzy modeling","sourcePdf":"00728458.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051178S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"97","articleId":"728458","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":728470,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

The simulated and experimental results also show that the proposed adaptive modulation techniques can be applied to 1-2-Mb/s indoor and outdoor microcellular systems with its delay spread of up to 250 ns and its terminal mobility of up to pedestrian speed without employing any special antifrequency-selective fading techniques, such as the adaptive equalizer and space diversity.","doi":"10.1109/25.728485","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/15705/00728485.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.728485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15705","startPage":"1134","endPage":"1147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol rate and modulation level-controlled adaptive modulation/TDMA/TDD system for high-bit-rate wireless data transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Symbol rate and modulation level-controlled adaptive modulation/TDMA/TDD system for high-bit-rate wireless data transmission","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728485/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"47","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6114698","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol rate and modulation level-controlled adaptive modulation/TDMA/TDD system for high-bit-rate wireless data transmission","sourcePdf":"00728485.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037481S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"81","articleId":"728485","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":728486,"authors":[{"name":"B.E.

A prioritized Bayesian broadcast algorithm is derived to stabilize multidimensional packet reservation multiple access (MD PRMA) and to allow for access delay discrimination of four different access classes. Access delay spread can be selected, and trading voice-dropping ratio against data-access delay is possible. To control multiple-access interference, Bayesian broadcast can be combined with load-based access control. The performance of both frequency-division duplex (FDD) and time-division duplex (TDD) mode is evaluated, the latter particularly relevant for TD/CDMA.

Four different neural network schemes are presented. In the first scheme, the controller is designed based on tracking the hub position while controlling the elastic deflection at the tip. In the second scheme, an output redefinition through online learning is proposed. To improve the transient as well as steady-state response of the system the two schemes are modified by adding a joint PD controller to the neural network controller. The performance of the proposed neural network controllers is illustrated by experimental results on a single flexible-link testbed. The control structures developed assume no a priori knowledge about the system dynamics, and the networks are all trained and employed as online controllers and no off-line training is required.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728500/","accessionNumber":"6128341","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-4 Sept. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural network controllers for a flexible-link manipulator: experimental results","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network controllers for a flexible-link manipulator: experimental results","confLoc":"Trieste, Italy","sourcePdf":"00728500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054196S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1998","isNumber":"15692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5844","articleId":"728500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":728505,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In particular, we envisage a high-quality premium service which guarantees the success of each handover procedure, called guaranteed handover (GH) service, and a low-cost lower quality service called regular service, where handover failures are accepted provided that the probability of a call being unsuccessful does not exceed a given value. This paper proposes a strategy which eliminates forced call terminations due to handover failures, thus allowing the GH service. This procedure applies to low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations using the satellite-fixed cell technique. An analytical model has been derived to calculate QoS parameters for a mixed population of GH and regular users. Providing both GH service to some users and regular service to other users requires an increased satellite capacity with respect to the case where all the users are served with the regular service; this capacity increase has been evaluated as a function of the percentage of GH users, the traffic load per cell, and the considered satellite mobility environment. The GH approach has been validated through the comparison with another scheme which envisages the queuing of handover requests for privileged users.","doi":"10.1109/25.728509","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/15705/00728509.pdf","startPage":"1200","endPage":"1214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.728509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis for a guaranteed handover service in an LEO constellation with a \"satellite-fixed cell\" system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728509/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis for a guaranteed handover service in an LEO constellation with a \"satellite-fixed cell\" system","volume":"47","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6114699","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis for a guaranteed handover service in an LEO constellation with a \"satellite-fixed cell\" system","sourcePdf":"00728509.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068091S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"70","articleId":"728509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":728512,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This work is motivated by a desire to obtain good estimates of the frame error rate (FER) for convolutional codes with bit-level interleaving over fading channels subject to practical power control algorithms. The convolutional code performance is quantified through the FER and effective E/sub b//N/sub 0/. where the latter is defined as the E/sub b//N/sub 0/ on an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel that results in the same FER. Given a received vector of (time-varying) E/sub b//N/sub 0/ values, we compute analytic estimates for the probability of frame error and the effective E/sub b//N/sub 0/ for a Viterbi decoder and interleaver combination. In particular, we validate our analysis using the R=1/3 convolutional code and interleaver used on the IS-95 CDMA reverse channel. Comparisons with simulations show that even for E/sub b//N/sub 0/ vectors with very large variations, our proposed estimates are good to within 0.2 dB for the effective E/sub b//N/sub 0/, giving FER estimates within a factor of two-five of the simulations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Convolutional codes","Fading","AWGN","Viterbi algorithm","Decoding","Interleaved codes","Power control","Additive white noise","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","fading channels","error statistics","AWGN channels","interleaved codes","time-varying channels","Viterbi decoding","cellular radio","coding errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frame error rate","convolutional codes","fading channels","effective E/sub b//N/sub 0/","Viterbi decoder","performance estimation","time-varying received signal levels","FER","bit-level interleaving","power control algorithms","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN channel","frame error probability","IS-95 CDMA reverse channel","cellular radio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728513","doi":"10.1109/25.728513","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/25/15705/00728513.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.728513","startPage":"1245","endPage":"1250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15705","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frame error rates for convolutional codes on fading channels and the concept of effective E/sub b//N/sub 0/","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frame error rates for convolutional codes on fading channels and the concept of effective E/sub b//N/sub 0/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","volume":"47","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6114701","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frame error rates for convolutional codes on fading channels and the concept of effective E/sub b//N/sub 0/","sourcePdf":"00728513.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028683S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"55","articleId":"728513","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":728515,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This paper compares the BER performance of differential detection and pilot symbol-assisted coherent detection of a direct-sequence (DS) spread-spectrum (SS) signal on a frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channel using RAKE reception. Both equal gain and maximal ratio combining are considered, and the effect of convolutional coding with interleaving is studied.

In a QS-CDMA system, the relative time delay between the signals of different users is random and restricted in a certain time range, that is, the signals are quasi-synchronous. The analysis shows that the multiple-access interference (MAI) of the QS-CDMA system is determined by the cross-correlation between spreading codes around the origin. To minimize the MAI of the QS-CDMA system, we design a new set of spreading codes. The performance is evaluated according to the criteria of the bit error rate (BER).

Both received signal strength indication (RSSI)-driven diversity and bit error rate (BER)-driven diversity are analyzed. The considered channel is a two-delay Rayleigh-fading channel; detection is done by differential detectors with either fixed or adaptive determination of the sampling time. Analysis is based on the method of error regions, where the instantaneous impulse response is represented by phasors in the complex plane. We first compute the joint probability density function (pdf) of the phasors of the two diversity branches. Depending on the selection criterion, the error probability is then computed as an integral over certain functions of this pdf. In the limit of small delay spreads S, the integrals are evaluated analytically. For fixed sampling, the admissible delay spread for BER=10/sup -3/ is increased by about a factor of three (as compared to the no-diversity case) for RSSI-driven diversity and a factor of four for BER-driven diversity. For adaptive sampling, RSSI-driven diversity gives little improvement in the admissible S for BER=10/sup -3/ while BER-driven diversity increases it by some 50%.

The predicted traffic is used to generate a traffic grid in terms of Erlang of dimension 36/spl times/72 in steps of 5/spl deg/ in both the latitude and longitude directions. The traffic grid is used to evaluate the performance of a dynamic channel allocation (DCA) technique as, well as a fixed channel allocation (FCA) technique. Both channel allocation techniques have been considered with the queuing of handover (QH) requests. In order to compare the respective techniques' performance, a low-earth orbit mobile satellite system (LEO-MSS) mobility model is developed to take into account the effect of satellites' motion during interbeam handovers. A theoretical model for obtaining the values of blocking probabilities for low-traffic loads is presented.

To conduct the variation analysis, a series of TCAD simulations was conducted on the basis of DoE (design of experiments) with optimum variable transformations, which resulted in RSF's (response surface functions) for threshold voltage (V/sub th/) and saturation drain current (I/sub ds/). A new global calibration of the RSF model based on experimental data gives excellent accuracy within 0.02 V error in V/sub th/ and 3% error in I/sub ds/. Using calibrated RSF, statistical process variation effects on the device characteristics have been quantitatively evaluated for each process recipe. It is found that variation of the gate-oxide formation process shows the most significant effect on the NMOS /spl Delta/I/sub ds/ in the production process. Furthermore we have designed an optimized 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS process and device on the basis of the RSF and also predicted the process variation effects on the device performance. It is shown that the V/sub th/ and I/sub ds/ variations of the 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS exhibit less than 10% I/sub ds/ variation in the production level process, which is similar to the value of 0.35-/spl mu/m CMOS experimental data. Additional TCAD simulations for MOS model parameter generation of the 0.25-/spl mu/m device was also conducted to allow circuit-designers to use predictive worst case circuit design parameters before experimental chip fabrication.","doi":"10.1109/66.728554","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","pdfPath":"/iel4/66/15704/00728554.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/66.728554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15704","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing","startPage":"575","endPage":"582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Accurate statistical process variation analysis for 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS with advanced TCAD methodology","volume":"11","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6094353","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate statistical process variation analysis for 0.25-/spl mu/m CMOS with advanced TCAD methodology","sourcePdf":"00728554.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047774S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"66","citationCount":"13","articleId":"728554","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":728566,"authors":[{"name":"Byungwhan Kim","affiliation":["Res.

Responses of an Al(Si) film etched in a chlorine-based plasma include etch rate, selectivity to oxide, anisotropy and bias of critical dimension (CD). The generalization accuracy of the models, measured by the root-mean squared error (RMS) on a test set, are 285 /spl Aring//min for etch rate, 5.58 for oxide selectivity, 0.08 for anisotropy, and 3.82 /spl Aring//min for CD bias. Al(Si) etch rate was found to be chlorine-dependent with significantly affected by magnetic field variations. For the other etch responses, RF power was dominant. Gas additives such as BCl/sub 3/ and N/sub 2/ were seen to have conflicting effects on etch outputs.

The proposed DVR restores the end-user voltage to its normal level by rapidly injecting a compensating voltage onto the line against the upstream power disturbances. The control strategy has adopted the concept of reference voltage tracking control. A control law is derived to maintain the downstream voltage in a pure sinusoidal waveshape with constant amplitude, no matter what kind of upstream power disturbances occur. Test results on 230 V mains are presented to demonstrate that the Cryo-MOSFET can be used as the power switching device for the converter, and to validate the control strategy.

Such a problem was recently investigated by the author using the discrete-Fourier method. However, the frequency-domain analysis has some limitations due to the fact that some of the accumulated timing-jitter noise power, found at the fundamental frequency component, would be added to the power of the input signal itself. Thus, in this paper, the analysis is performed in the time-domain and is restricted to the SNR measurement. An expression for the SNR in terms of timing-jitter distribution parameters, and the number of samples of the input signal is developed. Computer simulations are presented, which showed excellent agreement with the developed expression. Also, a comparison between the results obtained from the time-domain analysis and the frequency-domain is presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel4/19/15713/00728792.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/19.728792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.728792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15713","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of accumulated timing-jitter in the time domain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Sampling methods","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency domain analysis","Jitter","Clocks","Random variables","Performance analysis","Computer simulation","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal sampling","timing jitter","analogue-digital conversion","spectral analysis","random noise","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accumulated timing-jitter","time domain","signal-to-noise ratio","real sine waves","timing-jitter distribution parameters","number of samples","computer simulations","nonuniform sampling","power spectrum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1998","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of accumulated timing-jitter in the time domain","volume":"47","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1998","accessionNumber":"6099433","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of accumulated timing-jitter in the time domain","sourcePdf":"00728792.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029621S","chronDate":"Feb 1998","isNumber":"15713","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"41","articleId":"728792","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":728798,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The detection efficiency of semiconductor detectors depend upon the energy absorption efficiency as well as the collection efficiency. This study suggests that high signal-to-noise ratios can be obtained by optimally choosing which polarizing electrode is directly exposed to the incident X-ray beam, as well as on both the detector thickness and applied bias voltage. In addition, the experimental results on the temporal system MTF indicate a spatial resolution of >6 cy/mm. Besides the intrinsic charge transport characteristics of the semiconductor sample, by decreasing the collector size and optimizing the X-ray digital system geometry and temporal response, the temporal system MTF can be improved significantly.

The problem when using such models is establishing their structure and then identifying their linear subsystems. Both can be obtained from measured Volterra kernels. By performing tests with a pair of input signals, specially designed in order to measure these kernels, enough information can be gathered to separate the linear systems. A brief introduction is given to the measurement of Volterra kernels using periodic multisine signals. A method using combined tests is then proposed to estimate the nonparametric and parametric models of the linear subsystems.

First, Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models and some stability results are recalled. To design fuzzy controllers, chaotic systems are represented by Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models. The concept of parallel distributed compensation is employed to determine structures of fuzzy controllers from the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models, LMI-based design problems are defined and employed to find feedback gains of fuzzy controllers satisfying stability, decay rate, and constraints on control input and output of fuzzy control systems. Stabilization, synchronization, and chaotic model following control for chaotic systems are realized via the unified approach based on LMIs. An exact linearization (EL) technique is presented as a main result in the stabilization. The EL technique also plays an important role in the synchronization and the chaotic model following control. Two cases are considered in the synchronization. One is the feasible case of the EL problem. The other is the infeasible case of the EL problem. Furthermore, the chaotic model following control problem, which is more difficult than the synchronization problem, is discussed using the EL technique. Simulation results show the utility of the unified design approach based on LMIs proposed in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/81.728857","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/15711/00728857.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.728857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15711","startPage":"1021","endPage":"1040","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified approach to controlling chaos via an LMI-based fuzzy control system design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A unified approach to controlling chaos via an LMI-based fuzzy control system design","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728857/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6101598","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified approach to controlling chaos via an LMI-based fuzzy control system design","sourcePdf":"00728857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034127S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"314","articleId":"728857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":728860,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Yang","affiliation":["Electronics Research Laboratory and Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Tao Yang","id":"37087145757"},{"name":"Lin-Bao Yang","affiliation":["University of E-Zhou, Ezhou, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Lin-Bao Yang","id":"37086996917"},{"name":"Chun-Mei Yang","affiliation":["China Construction Bank, Songjiang Sub-branch, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Chun-Mei Yang","id":"37087261077"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7122"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1268"}],"articleNumber":"728860","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":70,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Chaotic communication","Transmitters","Communication switching","Signal processing","Communication system security","Information security","Robustness","Laboratories","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication switching","switching theory","synchronisation","chaos","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaotic switching","generalized synchronization","binary information signal","hyperchaotic system","secure communication","simulation","transmitter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728860","abstract":"In a chaotic switching scheme, a binary message signal is scrambled by two chaotic attractors.

Since GS is a very robust phenomenon, we find that an intruder can recover the binary information signal from chaotic switching schemes without knowing both the structure and parameters of the chaotic transmitter. The breaking method presented in this paper is not sensitive to the order of the transmitter, which means that even in a chaotic switching scheme which uses two hyperchaotic systems, the degree of security may still be low.

Since it is able to implement any Boolean function, its functionality expands on those of digital RAMs by adding new capabilities such as learning and interpolation. While it is able to embed all previously accumulated knowledge regarding useful binary information processing tasks performed by standard CNNs, the pyramidal universal cell provides a broader context for defining other useful processing tasks, including extended gray scale or color image processing as well. Examples of applications in image processing are provided in this paper. Implementation issues are also considered. Assuming some compromise between area and speed, a VLSI implementation of CNNs based on pyramidal cells offers a speedup of up to one million times when compared to corresponding software implementations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728862/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6101600","volume":"45","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pyramidal cells: a novel class of adaptive coupling cells and their applications for cellular neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pyramidal cells: a novel class of adaptive coupling cells and their applications for cellular neural networks","sourcePdf":"00728862.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047522S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"19","articleId":"728862","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":728877,"authors":[{"name":"P.

An analytical model accounting for the observed time dependence is proposed.","doi":"10.1109/55.728896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/55.728896","endPage":"413","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/55/15709/00728896.pdf","startPage":"411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hot hole stress induced leakage current (SILC) transient in tunnel oxides","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728896/","displayDocTitle":"Hot hole stress induced leakage current (SILC) transient in tunnel oxides","volume":"19","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"6093742","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hot hole stress induced leakage current (SILC) transient in tunnel oxides","sourcePdf":"00728896.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046934S","chronDate":"Nov.  1998","isNumber":"15709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"33","articleId":"728896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":728898,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Embedded systems are generally specified in terms of a set of acyclic task graphs. For medium- to large-scale embedded systems, the task graphs are usually hierarchical in nature. The embedded system architecture, which is the output of the cosynthesis system, may itself be nonhierarchical or hierarchical. Traditional nonhierarchical architectures create communication and processing bottlenecks and are impractical for large embedded systems. Such systems require a large number of processing elements and communication links connected in a hierarchical manner, thus forming a hierarchical distributed architecture, to meet performance and cost objectives. In this paper, we address the problem of hardware-software cosynthesis of hierarchical heterogeneous distributed embedded system architectures from hierarchical or nonhierarchical task graphs. Our cosynthesis algorithm has the following features: 1) it supports periodic task graphs with real-time constraints, 2) it supports pipelining of task graphs, 3) it supports a heterogeneous set of processing elements and communication links, 4) it allows both sequential and concurrent modes of communication and computation, 5) it employs a combination of preemptive and nonpreemptive static scheduling, 6) it employs a new task-clustering technique suitable for hierarchical task graphs, and 7) it uses the concept of association arrays to tackle the problem of multirate tasks encountered in multimedia systems. We show how our cosynthesis algorithm can be easily extended to consider fault tolerance or low-power objectives or both. Although hierarchical architectures have been proposed before, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the notion of hierarchical task graphs and hierarchical architectures has been supported in a cosynthesis algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/43.728913","startPage":"900","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/15708/00728913.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.728913","endPage":"919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"COHRA: hardware-software cosynthesis of hierarchical heterogeneous distributed embedded systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728913/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"COHRA: hardware-software cosynthesis of hierarchical heterogeneous distributed embedded systems","volume":"17","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6092175","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"COHRA: hardware-software cosynthesis of hierarchical heterogeneous distributed embedded systems","sourcePdf":"00728913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047623S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"29","articleId":"728913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":728914,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

MOGAC synthesizes real-time heterogeneous distributed architectures using an adaptive multiobjective genetic algorithm that can escape local minima. Price and power consumption are optimized while hard real-time constraints are met. MOGAC places no limit on the number of hardware or software processing elements in the architectures it synthesizes. Our general model for bus and point-to-point communication links allows a number of link types to be used in an architecture. Application-specific integrated circuits consisting of multiple processing elements are modeled. Heuristics are used to tackle multirate systems, as well as systems containing task graphs whose hyperperiods are large relative to their periods. The application of a multiobjective optimization strategy allows a single cosynthesis run to produce multiple designs that trade off different architectural features. Experimental results indicate that MOGAC has advantages over previous work in terms of solution quality and running time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Computer architecture","Embedded system","Energy consumption","Constraint optimization","Hardware","Integrated circuit synthesis","Power system modeling","Application specific integrated circuits","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","embedded systems","hardware-software codesign","graph theory","genetic algorithms","circuit optimisation","Pareto distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hard real-time constraints","hardware-software cosynthesis","distributed embedded systems","multiple periodic task graphs","heterogeneous distributed architectures","adaptive multiobjective genetic algorithm","processing elements","point-to-point communication links","application-specific integrated circuits","multirate systems","hyperperiods","multiobjective optimization strategy","architectural features","solution quality","running time"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728914","doi":"10.1109/43.728914","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/15708/00728914.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.728914","startPage":"920","endPage":"935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15708","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MOGAC: a multiobjective genetic algorithm for hardware-software cosynthesis of distributed embedded systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MOGAC: a multiobjective genetic algorithm for hardware-software cosynthesis of distributed embedded systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","volume":"17","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6092176","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MOGAC: a multiobjective genetic algorithm for hardware-software cosynthesis of distributed embedded systems","sourcePdf":"00728914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045749S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"159","articleId":"728914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":728917,"authors":[{"name":"R.

To validate the quality of the generated netlists, parameters that are not specified in the generation are compared with those of real circuits and with those of more \"random\" graphs.","doi":"10.1109/43.728919","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/15708/00728919.pdf","startPage":"985","endPage":"996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.728919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization and parameterized generation of synthetic combinational benchmark circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728919/","displayDocTitle":"Characterization and parameterized generation of synthetic combinational benchmark circuits","volume":"17","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6092181","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization and parameterized generation of synthetic combinational benchmark circuits","sourcePdf":"00728919.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024703S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"28","articleId":"728919","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":728924,"authors":[{"name":"V.

At the system level, power management is a very powerful technique and delivers large and unambiguous savings. The ideas behind power management can be extended to the logic level. This would involve determining which parts of a circuit are computing results that will be used and which are not. The parts that are not needed are then \"shut off\". This paper describes an approach termed guarded evaluation, which is an implementation of this idea. A theoretical framework and the algorithms that form the basis of the approach are presented. The underlying idea is to automatically determine the parts of the circuit that can be disabled on a per-clock-cycle basis. This saves the power used in all the useless transitions in those parts of the circuit. Initial experiments indicate substantial power savings and the strong potential of this approach for a large number of benchmark circuits. While this paper presents the development of these ideas at the logic level of design, the same ideas have direct application at the register-transfer level of design also.","doi":"10.1109/43.728924","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/43/15708/00728924.pdf","startPage":"1051","endPage":"1060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.728924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guarded evaluation: pushing power management to logic synthesis/design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/728924/","displayDocTitle":"Guarded evaluation: pushing power management to logic synthesis/design","volume":"17","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6092185","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guarded evaluation: pushing power management to logic synthesis/design","sourcePdf":"00728924.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042706S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"86","articleId":"728924","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":728962,"authors":[{"name":"W.M.

The Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) is a novel concept which offers multiple compensation functions for power transmission systems. The UPFC is capable of controlling the three basic transmission parameters (voltage, line impedance, and phase angle). Thus, the UPFC allows flexible control of both active and reactive power flows on transmission corridors. American Electric Power (AEP) has selected its Inez substation in eastern Kentucky for the location of the world's first UPFC installation. The UPFC is comprised of two /spl plusmn/160 MVA voltage-sourced GTO thyristor-based inverters, this installation is not only the first practical demonstration of the UPFC concept, but also by far the highest power GTO-based FACTS device ever installed. The two inverters can be decoupled and operated separately, one as a static compensator (STATCOM) and the other as a static synchronous series compensator (SSSC). Normally, they will be operated as a UPFC to regulate terminal bus voltage an simultaneously control power flow. This paper focuses on the UPFC equipment, challenges and the significant achievements that were made during the construction, commissioning tests, and the UPFC operational experience. This project is a collaborative effort between AEP, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.1998.728979","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.1998.728979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15699","startPage":"323","endPage":"327 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"POWERCON '98. 1998 International Conference on Power System Technology.

Due to the attenuation and distortion of travelling wave propagation in a transmission line, a open problem is how to define the arrival time and the propagation velocity of the travelling wave correctly. Since CWT has much better resolution for locating a transient event in time-domain, the arrival time can be defined by a characteristic point of the travelling wave extracted by a suitable continuous wavelet with the optimal dilation parameters, and the propagation velocity depends on the physical configuration of a transmission line and the optimal dilation parameters.

A contemporary solution to this problem is the addition of power system stabilizers to the automatic voltage regulators on the generators in the power system. The damping provided by this additional stabilizer provides the means to reduce the inhibiting effects of the oscillations. A novel modification of this controller is the inclusion in the feedback loop of information from a remote source. In this manner, the controller acts on the changes from the local source and the remote source. As is demonstrated, this yields a controller capable of more rapidly diminishing the oscillations in a test power system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPST.1998.729193","publicationTitle":"POWERCON '98. 1998 International Conference on Power System Technology.

A unified approach based on modal control theory is first used to design a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) power system stabilizer (PSS) for the studied power system.

Usually PD accelerates insulation deterioration and before final breakdown, their activities will be much more serious than that in ordinary operation. Therefore PD is an adequate characteristic quantity for the inspection of insulation condition in order to avoid sudden failures, especially for online monitoring. An artificial neural network (ANN) group with the backpropagation algorithm was developed to identify the types and extent of PDs. Six different physical models, which could reflect PDs in the stator windings of large electrical machines, were made. Simulated PD types included surface discharges at end windings, slot discharges, delamination in three different positions of ground wall insulation as well as a standard PD level of new machines. Different levels of voltage were applied to models to obtain various extents of PD activities. The fingerprints of experimental PD data were extracted with the /spl phi/-q-n 3-dimensional pattern. The recognition ability of the ANN group was investigated. Different types and extents of discharge within the winding insulation of large electrical machines were identified with a satisfactory recognition rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICPST.1998.729246","startPage":"1054","endPage":"1057 vol.2","publicationTitle":"POWERCON '98. 1998 International Conference on Power System Technology.

That is, with that damping coefficient in the system, it can be assured that the one-parameter transversality condition will be satisfied. The methodology, as developed, is an iterative monotonically convergent process very easy to implement and does not require knowledge of fault trajectory at all.

The soil dispersion is modeled by multiterm Lorentz and/or Debye models and incorporated into the FDTD scheme by using the piecewise-linear recursive convolution (PLRC) technique. The dispersive soil parameters are obtained by fitting the model to reported experimental data. The perfectly matched layer (PML) is extended to match dispersive media and used as an absorbing boundary condition to simulate an open space.

Instead of dealing with many residues due to erroneous-wrapped phase differences, the authors propose to use the local frequency as measured by a spectral analysis algorithm presented in a previous paper, E. Trouve et al. (1996). For this purpose, the authors present two conventional unwrapping algorithms, one local and the other global, which they revisit to benefit from the robust focal frequency estimates. For a local approach based on path-following techniques, they use the frequency estimates in a slope-compensated filter that extend the complex averaging up to a sufficient number of looks to eliminate residues due to the noise. Then they connect residues due to noninterferometric features along mask components resulting from the detection of layovers and uncorrelated areas. For a global approach, such as the weighted least-squares methods, they demonstrate that the use of noisy discrete phase gradient leads to a biased solution. To avoid this drawback, they propose to use the local frequency estimate and associated measure of confidence as phase gradient and weight. Results are presented on both topographic and differential interferograms obtained from the ERS-1 European radar satellite over various landscapes and the displacement field of the Landers 1992 earthquake.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving phase unwrapping techniques by the use of local frequency estimates","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.729368","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel4/36/15714/00729368.pdf","startPage":"1963","endPage":"1972","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.729368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=729368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/729368/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","displayDocTitle":"Improving phase unwrapping techniques by the use of local frequency estimates","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6099591","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving phase unwrapping techniques by the use of local frequency estimates","sourcePdf":"00729368.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034806S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"87","articleId":"729368","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":729370,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In addition, full-band thermal noise is present. The channel model is that of a partial-band jammer in which a fraction of the frequency band is jammed and the remaining fraction is unjammed. This paper focuses on the implementation and performance of a modified turbo decoder for this model. We refer to the knowledge that each transmitted bit is jammed as channel state information. We consider cases of known or unknown channel state and variable number of bits per hop. Our approach is to modify the calculation of branch transition probabilities inherent in the original turbo decoder. For the cases with no side information and multiple bits per hop, we iteratively calculate channel state estimates. Analytical bounds are derived and simulation is performed for noncoherent demodulation. The performance of turbo codes is compared with a Reed-Solomon and a concatenated code comprised of a convolutional inner code and Reed-Solomon outer code.","doi":"10.1109/26.729389","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/15715/00729389.pdf","startPage":"1451","endPage":"1458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.729389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo codes for noncoherent FH-SS with partial band interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=729389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","displayDocTitle":"Turbo codes for noncoherent FH-SS with partial band interference","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/729389/","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"6099541","volume":"46","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo codes for noncoherent FH-SS with partial band interference","sourcePdf":"00729389.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046808S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"47","articleId":"729389","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":729390,"authors":[{"name":"Q.T.

The difficulty arises from inherent nonlinearity in noncoherent detection and from attempts to determine explicitly the probability density function of the total signal-to-noise ratio at the combiner output. We directly determine the error probability from the characteristic function of decision variables, resulting in closed-form solutions involving matrix differentiation. The performance calculation is further simplified by developing a recursive technique.

Our approach takes into account the details of the specific coding/modulation scheme and tracks the fading process symbol by symbol. It is shown that a Markov approximation for the block error process (possibly degenerating into an identically distributed (i.i.d.) process for sufficiently fast fading) is a good model for a broad range of parameters. Also, it is observed that the relationship between the marginal error rate and the transition probability is largely insensitive to parameters such as block length, degree of forward error correction and modulation format, and depends essentially on an appropriately normalized version of the Doppler frequency. This relationship can therefore be computed in the simple case of a threshold model and then used more generally as an accurate approximation. This observation leads to a unified approach for the channel modeling, and to a simplified performance analysis of upper layer protocols.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/729391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"6099543","displayDocTitle":"Error statistics in data transmission over fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error statistics in data transmission over fading channels","sourcePdf":"00729391.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075739S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"197","articleId":"729391","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":729393,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Three homes and two stands of trees were studied for outdoor path loss, tree loss, and house penetration loss in a narrow-band measurement campaign that included 270 local area path loss measurements and over 276000 instantaneous power measurements. Outdoor transmitters at a height of 5.5 m were placed at distances between 30 and 210 m from the homes, to simulate typical neighborhood base stations mounted atop utility poles. All path loss data are presented graphically and coupled with site-specific information. We develop measurement-based path loss models for propagation prediction. The measurements and models may aid the development of futuristic outdoor-to-indoor residential communication systems for wireless Internet access, wireless cable distribution, and wireless local loops.","doi":"10.1109/26.729393","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/15715/00729393.pdf","startPage":"1484","endPage":"1496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.729393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurements and models for radio path loss and penetration loss in and around homes and trees at 5.85 GHz","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=729393","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/729393/","displayDocTitle":"Measurements and models for radio path loss and penetration loss in and around homes and trees at 5.85 GHz","volume":"46","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6099545","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurements and models for radio path loss and penetration loss in and around homes and trees at 5.85 GHz","sourcePdf":"00729393.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033687S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"192","articleId":"729393","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":729394,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The computations are based on spatial covariance matrices which describe the user-specific channels averaged over the fast fading. The presented algorithm succeeds in minimizing the array transmit power while spatially separating the users, no matter which rank their spatial covariance matrices have.

A unified and accurate analysis of the effect of these sources of noise on the PLL is carried out based on a nonlinear model (the Fokker-Planck method) since a linear analysis yields a large deviation between analytical results and actual performance at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). After describing the implementation of the PLL, the steady-state probability density function (PDF) of the phase estimator error in a first-order loop is derived. It is shown that a tradeoff exists between the effect due to the phase noise, the magnitude of the multiuser interference, and the AWGN as a function of loop bandwidth. The optimal loop bandwidth minimizing the impact of these sources of noise on the PLL and the requirements on the frequency uncertainty of the carrier source for a required accuracy of the phase estimator are detailed.

In particular, the performance of M-ary Walsh-Hadamard orthogonal (MWHO) convolutionally coded DS-CDMA over a Rice-log-normal fading channel is analyzed in depth, and compared to the simpler coded differential BPSK (DBPSK) scheme. Optimization of the performance/complexity tradeoff in the metric computation for soft inputs to the Viterbi (1979) decoder is addressed. Upper bounds on the error probability without or with satellite diversity and equal gain combining are evaluated considering different coding rates. The effect of correlated fading is also taken into account via simulation. Among the various results, it is shown that the optimal coding rate is a function of the satellite elevation angle and of the diversity order, that the loss for using DBPSK instead of MWHO is in the range 1-1.4 dB, and that interleaving depth is a critical parameter.","doi":"10.1109/26.729397","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/26/15715/00729397.pdf","startPage":"1525","endPage":"1535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.729397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15715","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of coded noncoherent transmission in DS-CDMA mobile satellite communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=729397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/729397/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of coded noncoherent transmission in DS-CDMA mobile satellite communications","volume":"46","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1998","accessionNumber":"6099549","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of coded noncoherent transmission in DS-CDMA mobile satellite communications","sourcePdf":"00729397.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042288S","chronDate":"Nov 1998","isNumber":"15715","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","articleId":"729397","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":729398,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We show that this ACRB is related to the CRB for the joint estimation of the scalar parameter and the nuisance parameters. Previously, a modified CRB (MCRB) for the estimation of a scalar parameter in the presence of nuisance parameters has been derived. This MCRB is also simple to evaluate and is related to the CRB for the estimation of the scalar parameter assuming that the value of the nuisance parameters is a priori known.

These advances demand more wearable and mobile form factors for products that access information. A product that is wearable should have wearability. This paper explores the concept of dynamic wearability, through design research. Wearability is defined as the interaction between the human body and the wearable object. Dynamic wearability extends that definition to include the human body in motion. Our research has been to locate, understand, and define the spaces on the human body where solid and flexible forms can rest-without interfering with fluid human movement. The result is a set of design guidelines embodied in a set of wearable forms. These wearable forms describe the three dimensional spaces on the body best suited for comfortable and unobtrusive wearability by design.","doi":"10.1109/ISWC.1998.729537","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest of Papers.

In this spirit, this paper examines three different devices that can be built into a shoe, (where excess energy is readily harvested) and used for generating electrical power \"parasitically\" while walking. Two of these are piezoelectric in nature: a unimorph strip made from piezoceramic composite material and a stave made from a multilayer laminate of PVDF foil. The third is a shoe-mounted rotary magnetic generator. Test results are given for these systems, their relative merits and compromises are discussed, and suggestions are proposed for improvements and potential applications in wearable systems. As a self-powered application example, a system had been built around the piezoelectric shoes that periodically broadcasts a digital RFID as the bearer walks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWC.1998.729539","doi":"10.1109/ISWC.1998.729539","displayPublicationTitle":"Digest of Papers.

In RDT, each node is associated with a disc, around which its children are placed. Using discs instead of cones as the basic shape in RDT has several advantages: significant reduction of occluded region, sharp increase in number of displayed nodes, and easy projection onto plane without visual overlapping. We show that RDT can greatly enhance user perception by transforming its shapes dynamically in several ways: (1) disc tree which can significantly reduce the occluded region by the foreground objects; (2) compact disc tree which can increase the number of nodes displayed on the screen; and (3) plane disc tree which can be mapped onto the plane without visual overlapping. We describe an implementation of our visualization system called VISIT (Visual Information System for reconfigurable dIsc tree). It provides 2D and 3D layouts for RDT and various user interface features such as tree reconfiguration, tree transformation, tree shading, viewing transformation, animation, selection and browsing which can enhance the user perception and navigation capabilities. We also evaluate our system using the following three metrics: percentage of occlusion, density of displayed nodes on a screen, and number of identifiable nodes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 Oct 1998","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/729555/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"6096932","conferenceDate":"19-20 Oct. 1998","publicationDate":"1998","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable disc trees for visualizing large hierarchical information space","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable disc trees for visualizing large hierarchical information space","confLoc":"Research Triangle, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00729555.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047277S","chronDate":"19-20 Oct 1998","isNumber":"15744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5905","citationCount":"18","articleId":"729555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":729557,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

IVORY is especially designed for information visualization applications and multidimensional graph layout. It is fully implemented in Java 1.1 and its architecture features client server setup, which allows us to run the visualization even on thin clients. In addition, VRML 2.0 exports can be viewed by any VRML plugged-in WWW browser. Individual visual metaphors are invoked into IVORY via an advanced plug-in mechanism, where plug-ins can be implemented by any experienced user. The configuration of IVORY is accomplished using a script language, called IVML. Some interactive visualization examples, such as the integration of a haptic interface illustrate the performance and versatility of our system.

High spatial frequencies due to abrupt intensity changes at object surfaces result in jagged or terraced surfaces in rendered images. The use of a distance-to-closest-surface function to encode object surfaces is proposed. This function varies smoothly across surfaces and hence can be accurately reconstructed from sampled data. The zero value iso surface of the distance map yields the object surface and the derivative of the distance map yields the surface normal. Examples of rendered images are presented along with a new method for calculating distance maps from sampled binary data.","doi":"10.1109/SVV.1998.729581","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SVV.1998.729581","startPage":"23","endPage":"30","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Symposium on Volume Visualization (Cat.

In particular, the specification of the transfer function-the mapping from data values to renderable optical properties-is frequently a time consuming and unintuitive task. Ideally, the data being visualized should itself suggest an appropriate transfer function that brings out the features of interest without obscuring them with elements of little importance. We demonstrate that this is possible for a large class of scalar volume data, namely that where the regions of interest are the boundaries between different materials. A transfer function which makes boundaries readily visible can be generated from the relationship between three quantities: the data value and its first and second directional derivatives along the gradient direction. A data structure we term the histogram volume captures the relationship between these quantities throughout the volume in a position independent, computationally efficient fashion. We describe the theoretical importance of the quantities measured by the histogram volume, the implementation issues in its calculation, and a method for semiautomatic transfer function generation through its analysis. We conclude with results of the method on both idealized synthetic data as well as real world datasets.","doi":"10.1109/SVV.1998.729588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SVV.1998.729588","startPage":"79","endPage":"86","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Symposium on Volume Visualization (Cat.

However, most software development process managers erroneously assume completeness of the test programs. This has often resulted in an incorrect system evaluation and the release of poor quality products to the field. The understanding of this limitation can become a strength by driving the testers to optimize the positioning of the test programs (robust testing). The observation that software errors tend to form clusters (design holes) permits the use of statistical failure analysis to pinpoint the largest and most likely defective areas. It is essential to periodically halt testing and analyze the test failure data in order to optimize the use of the remaining testing resources and interval. The entire test program can be stopped when the likelihood of residual design errors is small enough.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software testing","Process control","Debugging","Software quality","System testing","Failure analysis","Costs","Process design","Software systems","Programming"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TENCON.1991.729675","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00729675.png","publicationTitle":"TENCON '91.

Critical degradation is found to be associated with a more than proportional increase of the dielectric properties when increasing the applied test voltage above a certain level. In this paper an explanation for this nonlinearity will be presented, using a mechanical approach to the water treeing phenomenon. The water treed insulation is considered to consist of small water filled voids separated by crazing zones. At relatively low water content and low applied test voltage, several of these crazing zones are likely to be closed and insulating. When increasing the test voltage, Maxwell mechanical stresses will cause water to penetrate into the crazing zones, thus making electric contact between the elongated water droplets. Results from finite element method (FEM) calculations of electric fields and losses show that the effect of this will be to enhance the electric field at the tip of these conductive channels and to increase the dielectric losses of the water treed insulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding water treeing mechanisms in the development of diagnostic test methods","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/94.729699","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/15731/00729699.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.729699","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15731","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=729699","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/729699/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"Understanding water treeing mechanisms in the development of diagnostic test methods","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6085224","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding water treeing mechanisms in the development of diagnostic test methods","sourcePdf":"00729699.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045427S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15731","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"65","articleId":"729699","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":729719,"authors":[{"name":"E.A.

Two standards, IEEE 802.11 and ETSI HIPERLAN type 1, are currently available for WLAN; the standardization process of wireless ATM, involving, among others, the wireless ATM Group of the ATM Forum and the broadband radio access networks project of the ETSI, is ongoing and related standards are expected to be released by mid-1999. This article focuses on the MAC protocol aspects of wireless local access networks. It first investigates, from a traffic performance point of view, the MAC protocol of the IEEE 802.11 and ETSI HIPERLAN type 1 standards, and then verifies to what extent these MAC protocols are suitable for wireless ATM. The analysis is then extended by considering a new MAC protocol, dynamic slot assignment (DSA++), which has been designed to explicitly support ATM technology over the radio interface. DSA++ is a candidate for the ETSI HIPERLAN type 2 standard, a developing ETSI standard for wireless ATM.","doi":"10.1109/98.729725","publicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel4/98/15751/00729725.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/98.729725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MAC protocols for wideband wireless local access: evolution toward wireless ATM","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/729725/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","displayDocTitle":"MAC protocols for wideband wireless local access: evolution toward wireless ATM","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6077301","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MAC protocols for wideband wireless local access: evolution toward wireless ATM","sourcePdf":"00729725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087404S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"98","citationCount":"38","articleId":"729725","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":729727,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

Therefore they draw a nonsinusoidal current with a low power factor. Conventional linear controllers used for power factor correction of these converters do not offer a wide dynamic range. Neural network controllers (NNC) are nonlinear, which learn, adapt and provide wider dynamic range. This paper presents the use of NNCs in power factor correction of AC/DC switching converters. The NNC replaces the conventional current mode controller (CMC) of the high power factor AC/DC converter. Both the direct and indirect NN control schemes are used. Comparisons are made between the simulation results of the NNC and those of the CMC under normal and dynamic operations. The results demonstrate that NNCs can effectively control the high power factor AC/DC switching converter. The NNC performance is comparable, and in some cases better than the CMC. The NN controllers perform better with parameter variations compared to the fixed gain CMC. The fault tolerance capability of the NNC shows excellent results.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1998.729727","startPage":"1617","endPage":"1624 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of 1998 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.

These applications require a predictable communication network, where time-constrained traffic requires bounds on throughput and latency, while good average performance suffices for best-effort packets. This paper presents a new router architecture that tailors low-level routing, switching, arbitration, flow-control, and deadlock-avoidance policies to the conflicting demands of each traffic class. The router implements bandwidth regulation and deadline-based scheduling, with packet switching and table-driven multicast routing, to bound end-to-end delay and buffer requirements for time-constrained traffic while allowing best-effort traffic to capitalize on the low-latency routing and switching schemes common in modern parallel machines. To limit the cost of servicing time-constrained traffic, the router includes a novel packet scheduler that shares link-scheduling logic across the multiple output ports, while masking the effects of dock rollover on the representation of packet eligibility times and deadlines. Using the Verilog hardware description language and the Epoch silicon compiler, we demonstrate that the router design meets the performance goals of both traffic classes in a single-chip solution. Verilog simulation experiments on a detailed timing model of the chip show how the implementation and performance properties of the packet scheduler scale over a range of architectural parameters.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.729792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=15732","startPage":"1088","endPage":"1101","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel4/12/15732/00729792.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A router architecture for real-time communication in multicomputer networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/729792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1998","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1998","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A router architecture for real-time communication in multicomputer networks","publicationDate":"Oct. 1998","accessionNumber":"6087354","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"47","issue":"10","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A router architecture for real-time communication in multicomputer networks","sourcePdf":"00729792.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072359S","chronDate":"Oct 1998","isNumber":"15732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"25","articleId":"729792","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1998","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":729803,"authors":[{"name":"Euh-Suh Koo","affiliation":["Pohang Steel Company, Kwangyang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Euh-Suh Koo","id":"37087869201"},{"name":"Hyeoun-Dong Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyeoun-Dong Lee","id":"37087261352"},{"name":"Seung-Ki Sul","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Ki Sul","id":"37086965531"},{"name":"Joohn-Sheok Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Inc.heon, Incheon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Joohn-Sheok Kim","id":"37087303837"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4943-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-2618"}],"articleNumber":"729803","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":365},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Torque control strategy for a parallel hybrid vehicle using fuzzy logic","abstract":"In this paper, the fuzzy logic based torque controller for a parallel hybrid electric vehicle is proposed.

This approach has the following ballast design implications: (i) dimming to 1%; (ii) ignition at any dim setting; (iii) end-of-life detection; (iv) multiple lamp management; (v) no heating or current transformers required; (vi) no op-amps required; (vii) immunity from lamp negative incremental impedance effects; (viii) reduction of PCB interconnects and IC pin requirements; and (viii) minimum changes needed to adapt nondimming ballast for dimming. The result is a high-performance dimming solution with a significant cost reduction. A complete dimmable ballast has been built that incorporates a new integrated circuit verifying all of these features.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1998.729906","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of 1998 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.

Another important aspect is that the ballast should provide a wide stable control range of the output power, some applications require dimming down the output power to less than 20% of the nominal value. One of the most commonly used topologies for driving fluorescent lamps is the resonant half bridge inverter. In this topology, the starting scenario and the stable dimming range depends on both the control parameter selected and the control strategy used. This paper focuses on the LCC series-parallel resonant inverter. Different design and control methodologies are analyzed from the point of view of the starting scenario and the stable control range obtained. Generalized characteristics are obtained to simplify the design of the resonant tank, including operating points where the fundamental approach gives no accurate results. Finally, the theoretical and practical results obtained using the different control strategies are compared.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1998.729939","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1998.729939","startPage":"2068","endPage":"2075 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of 1998 IEEE Industry Applications Conference.
