If guarantee funds are to be effective, a majority of firms can obtain financial assistance through corporate bonds market. This paper describes the mutual guarantee bond which can be a viable solution to the problem of access to credit from capital market for small and middle-entrepreneurs. This work uses a jump diffusion process to estimate the price of mutual guarantee bonds made under the terms of the China Small Business Financing Program. First, a logistic structural model of mutual guarantee bond is built up. The model was then employed to design the logical pricing model of credit spread when an exogenous default process jumps for the first time.

Therefore, the operation of these circuits to tolerate soft errors is a strict requirement in todaypsilas designs. Traditional error tolerant methods result in significant cost penalties in terms of power, area and performance, and the development of low-cost hardened designs for storage cells (such as latches and memories) is of increasing importance. This paper proposes new hardened designs for CMOS latches at 32 nm feature size. Three hardened latch circuits are proposed; two of these circuits are Schmitt trigger based, while the third one utilizes a cascode configuration in the feedback loop. These new hardened latches are shown to have superior performance in terms of power-delay product as well as highest tolerance to soft errors (measured by the critical charge) than existing hardened latches. Extensive simulation results are provided using the predictive technology file for 32 nm feature size in CMOS.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2009.10","publicationTitle":"2009 27th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 27th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5116585/5116586/05116607.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2009.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5116586","startPage":"41","endPage":"46","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-Error Hardening Designs of Nanoscale CMOS Latches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5116607","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Soft-Error Hardening Designs of Nanoscale CMOS Latches","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5116607/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-7 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10747077","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5116607/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-Error Hardening Designs of Nanoscale CMOS Latches","confLoc":"Santa Cruz, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3598a041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082013S","chronDate":"3-7 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5116585","isNumber":"5116586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5116585","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5116586","articleId":"5116607","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5116608,"authors":[{"name":"Rudrajit Datta","affiliation":["University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, US"],"firstName":"Rudrajit","lastName":"Datta","id":"37575455600"},{"name":"Nur A.

Memories are generally protected with single-error-correcting, double-error-detecting (SEC-DED) codes using the minimum number of check bits. In the proposed method, unused spare columns are exploited to store additional check bits which can be used to reduce the miscorrection probability for triple errors in SEC-DED codes or non-adjacent double errors in single adjacent error correcting codes (SEC-DAEC) codes.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2009.52","publicationTitle":"2009 27th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 27th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5116585/5116586/05116608.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5116586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2009.52","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Unused Spare Columns to Improve Memory ECC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5116608/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Unused Spare Columns to Improve Memory ECC","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5116608/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10747078","conferenceDate":"3-7 May 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Unused Spare Columns to Improve Memory ECC","confLoc":"Santa Cruz, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3598a047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056931S","chronDate":"3-7 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5116585","isNumber":"5116586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5116585","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5116586","articleId":"5116608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5116609,"authors":[{"name":"Te-Hsuan Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Te-Hsuan","lastName":"Chen","id":"37576429900"},{"name":"Yu-Ying Hsiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Ying","lastName":"Hsiao","id":"37538002100"},{"name":"Yu-Tsao Hsing","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Tsao","lastName":"Hsing","id":"37273810300"},{"name":"Cheng-Wen Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Wen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37276423200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3598-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"}],"articleNumber":"5116609","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":15,"totalDownloads":1154},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5116609","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction","Flash memory","Error correction codes","Decoding","Encoding","Memory management","Fault tolerance","Information retrieval","Polynomials","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","flash memories","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive-rate error correction scheme","NAND flash memory","flash memory controller","BCH codes","high noise level","storage space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error correction","flash memory","BCH code","memory fault tolerance","memory management"]}],"abstract":"ECC has been widely used to enhance flash memory endurance and reliability.

The number of signals that can be observed is limited by bandwidth and storage requirements. This paper presents an automated procedure to select which signals to observe to facilitate early detection of circuit malfunction to help find the root cause of a bug. This paper exploits the nature of error propagation in sequential circuits by observing signals which are most often sensitized to possible errors. Given a functional input vector set, an error transmission matrix is generated by analyzing which flip-flops are sensitized to other flip-flops. Signal observability is enhanced by merging data from relatively independent flip-flops. The final set of signals to observe is determined through integer linear programming (ILP) which provides a set of locations that maximally cover the possible error sites within given constraints. Experimental results indicate that the cycle in which a bug first appears can be more rapidly and precisely found with the proposed approach thereby speeding up the post-silicon debug process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5116613/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10747083","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5116613/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"3-7 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automated Selection of Signals to Observe for Efficient Silicon Debug","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Selection of Signals to Observe for Efficient Silicon Debug","confLoc":"Santa Cruz, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3598a079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046493S","chronDate":"3-7 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5116585","isNumber":"5116586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5116585","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5116586","articleId":"5116613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5116615,"authors":[{"name":"Richard McLaughlin","affiliation":["FM6-108, Intel Corporation, Folsom, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"McLaughlin","id":"37580078300"},{"name":"Srikanth Venkataraman","affiliation":["RA1-325, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Srikanth","lastName":"Venkataraman","id":"37358052400"},{"name":"Carlston Lim","affiliation":["PG5-2, Intel Corporation, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Carlston","lastName":"Lim","id":"37578273500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3598-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"}],"articleNumber":"5116615","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":97,"totalDownloads":551},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic testing","Silicon","Timing","System testing","Frequency","Computer bugs","Circuit simulation","Microprocessors","Data mining","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design for testability","failure analysis","integrated circuit testing","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated debug","speed path failures","functional tests","internal speed-paths","Intel Core i7 quad-core processor","design-for-debug features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Silicon debug","speed-path","timing","design for debug","functional tests"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Debug of Speed Path Failures Using Functional Tests","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2009.53","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5116586","endPage":"96","publicationTitle":"2009 27th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 27th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5116585/5116586/05116615.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2009.53","startPage":"91","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5116615","abstract":"Debug of at-speed failures using functional tests is a key challenge as part of frequency pushes during post-silicon debug to improve performance of high performance designs, especially microprocessors.

However, the effectiveness of recently proposed test techniques for biochips is limited by the fact that current design methods do not consider testability. We introduce the concept of design-for-testability (DFT) for microfluidic biochips and propose a DFT method that incorporates a test plan into the fluidic operations of a target bioassay protocol. By using the testability-aware bioassay protocol as an input to the biochip design tool, the proposed DFT method ensures a high level of testability, defined as the percentage of the electrodes or functional units on the synthesized chip that can be effectively tested. We evaluate the DFT method using a representative multiplexed bioassay and the polymerase chain reaction.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 27th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5116585/5116586/05116652.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"314","publicationTitle":"2009 27th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2009.16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2009.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5116586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5116652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design-for-Testability for Digital Microfluidic Biochips","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microfluidics","Design for testability","Design methodology","Electrodes","Pins","Protocols","Circuit testing","Costs","Very large scale integration","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioMEMS","design for testability","digital integrated circuits","integrated circuit testing","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital microfluidic biochips","design-for-testability","testability-aware bioassay protocol","polymerase chain reaction","representative multiplexed bioassay","functional units","electrodes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["biochip testing","DFT","functional testability","lab-on-chip","pin-constrained biochips"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5116652/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design-for-Testability for Digital Microfluidic Biochips","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5116652/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10747117","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"3-7 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design-for-Testability for Digital Microfluidic Biochips","confLoc":"Santa Cruz, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3598a309.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088536S","chronDate":"3-7 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5116585","isNumber":"5116586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5116585","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5116586","articleId":"5116652","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5116653,"authors":[{"name":"Julio Vazquez","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Institute for Astrophysics, Optics, and Electronics INAOE, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Julio","lastName":"Vazquez","id":"37402064000"},{"name":"Victor Champac","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Institute for Astrophysics Optics and Electronics, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Champac","id":"37273615800"},{"name":"Chuck Hawkins","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Chuck","lastName":"Hawkins","id":"37284129500"},{"name":"Jaume Segura","affiliation":["GSE, University of Balearic Islands, Mallorca, Spain"],"firstName":"Jaume","lastName":"Segura","id":"37285171400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3598-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"}],"articleNumber":"5116653","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","CMOS technology","Failure analysis","Fault detection","Logic gates","CMOS logic circuits","Capacitance","Leakage current","Fault location","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","failure analysis","integrated circuit reliability","integrated circuit testing","logic testing","nanoelectronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stuck-open fault","nanometer technology","failure mechanism unique","CMOS technology","logic gate","leakage currents","fault detection","test vector strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Julio Vazquez","Victor Champac","Chuck Hawkins","Jaume Segura"]}],"abstract":"The stuck-open fault (SOF) is a difficult, hard failure mechanism unique to CMOS technology.

The small nanometer technology capacitances and the increased leakage currents result in faster discharges of the floating high impedance node making fault detection more difficult. A test vector strategy is proposed to improve the detection of this fault for technologies with gate current leakage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stuck-Open Fault Leakage and Testing in Nanometer Technologies","publicationTitle":"2009 27th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2009.33","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 27th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5116585/5116586/05116653.pdf","startPage":"315","endPage":"320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2009.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5116586","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5116653","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5116653/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Stuck-Open Fault Leakage and Testing in Nanometer Technologies","conferenceDate":"3-7 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5116653/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10747118","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stuck-Open Fault Leakage and Testing in Nanometer Technologies","confLoc":"Santa Cruz, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3598a315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047086S","chronDate":"3-7 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5116585","isNumber":"5116586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5116585","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5116586","articleId":"5116653","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5116655,"authors":[{"name":"Gaetan Canivet","affiliation":["CESTI/CEA-LETI, Minatec, Grenoble, France"," Grenoble INP, UJF, CNRS, TIMA Laboratory, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Gaetan","lastName":"Canivet","id":"37545969600"},{"name":"Regis Leveugle","affiliation":[" Grenoble INP, UJF, CNRS, TIMA Laboratory, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Regis","lastName":"Leveugle","id":"37273803800"},{"name":"Jessy Clediere","affiliation":["CESTI/CEA-LETI, Minatec, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Jessy","lastName":"Clediere","id":"37545971500"},{"name":"Frederic Valette","affiliation":["DGA Maitrise de l'Information, Bruz, FR"],"firstName":"Frederic","lastName":"Valette","id":"37399334500"},{"name":"Marc Renaudin","firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Renaudin","id":"37282559600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3598-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-0167"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-1053"}],"articleNumber":"5116655","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Cryptography","Protection","Very large scale integration","System testing","Laboratories","Indium phosphide","Dissolved gas analysis","Circuit faults","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","field programmable gate arrays","lasers","logic design","radiation hardening (electronics)","security of data","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["effective laser spot","Virtex-II FPGA configuration","SRAM","fault based attacks","effective sensitive"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","SRAM-based","fault attack","configuration errors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5116655","abstract":"SRAM-based FPGAs are an appealing platform to implement many systems, including secure ones. However, secure systems are subject to attacks and one of the main threats is fault-based attacks using lasers. The sensitivity of the configuration memory in a SRAM-based FPGA has to be studied in this context. This paper reports on the characterization of the effective laser spot, or effective sensitive area, with respect to the laser focus and to the attacked configuration bits. The test vehicle is a Virtex II FPGA. It is shown in particular that the initial value of the bit has a strong influence on the effective sensitive area of the spot. Such data can be used to better understand the actual effects of an attack and to design more efficient counter-measures. Also, it is shown that attacks based on single bit flips in the configuration are possible in practice even with relatively large laser spots.","doi":"10.1109/VTS.2009.19","publicationTitle":"2009 27th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 27th IEEE VLSI Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/5116585/5116586/05116655.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5116586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTS.2009.19","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of Effective Laser Spots during Attacks in the Configuration of a Virtex-II FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5116655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-7 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of Effective Laser Spots during Attacks in the Configuration of a Virtex-II FPGA","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5116655/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10747120","conferenceDate":"3-7 May 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of Effective Laser Spots during Attacks in the Configuration of a Virtex-II FPGA","confLoc":"Santa Cruz, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3598a327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064761S","chronDate":"3-7 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5116585","isNumber":"5116586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5116585","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5116586","articleId":"5116655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5116737,"authors":[{"name":"Liyong Wan","affiliation":["College of Humanity& Social Science, Wuhan University of Science and Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Liyong","lastName":"Wan","id":"37288157700"},{"name":"Chengling Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chengling","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37287524800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3635-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5116737","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Data mining","Biological cells","Gas insulated transmission lines","Databases","Genetic mutations","Educational institutions","Data engineering","Genetic engineering","Knowledge engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","entropy","genetic algorithms","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy-based hybrid genetic algorithm","rule acquisition","data mining system","unsupervised knowledge extraction","noisy database","large database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","entropy","data mining","knowledge extraction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5116737","abstract":"The paper describes the implementation and the functioning of RAHGA (Rule Acquisition with an Entropy-based Genetic Algorithm), a genetic-algorithm-based data mining system suitable for both supervised and certain types of unsupervised knowledge extraction from large and possibly noisy databases.

One of the enhancements over 3G wireless systems is that in LTE DRX mode can be enabled even when the user equipment is registered with the evolved node-B. However, there is a need to optimize the DRX parameters, so as to maximize power saving without incurring network re-entry and packet delay.

Frequency-selective feedback is provided on achievable data rates for preferred single- and multistream transmission modes. The base station selects the best mode while providing instantaneous fairness. We observe that multiuser transmission increases the probability of using multistream transmission. Besides the benefits from optimal combining at the physical layer, there is an additional gain at the MAC layer since the estimation of achievable rates becomes more precise. Altogether, 93 percent of the theoretical throughput can be realized by synchronizing the base stations and providing cell-specific reference signals.

This interest is justified by the inherent single carrier structure of the SC-FDMA scheme, which is more robust against phase noise and has a lower peak-to-average power ratio than orthogonal frequency-division multiple access. This consequently makes it more attractive for uplink transmission from low-cost devices with limited transmit power. SC-FDMA commonly makes use of frequency domain linear equalization in order to combat the frequency selectivity of the transmission channel. Frequency domain decision feedback equalization, composed of a frequency domain feed forward filter and a time domain feedback filter, outperforms LE due to its ability to cancel precursor echoes. Although these solutions suffer from error propagation, results show that DFE still offers a significant performance gain over conventional LE for uncoded SC-FDMA. In this article we show how precoding can be used on the uplink of the LTE standard to overcome the frequency selective nature of the radio channel. We propose a frequency domain implementation of Tomlinson- Harashima precoding and investigate the bit error rate and the PAPR performance for SCFDMA using ZF and MMSE THP.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5116787/05116802.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"74","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2009.5116802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2009.5116802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5116787","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5116802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-domain precoding for single carrier frequency-division multiple access","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","AWGN","OFDM","Transmitters","Pulse shaping methods","Decision feedback equalizers","Frequency domain analysis","Partial transmit sequences","Frequency diversity","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","diversity reception","fading channels","filtering theory","frequency division multiple access","frequency-domain analysis","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain precoding","single carrier frequency-division multiple access","frequency domain linear equalization","frequency selectivity","frequency domain decision feedback equalization","frequency domain feed forward filter","time domain feedback filter","radio channel","uplink SC-FDMA transmission","fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5116802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-domain precoding for single carrier frequency-division multiple access","volume":"47","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5116802/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10732288","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-domain precoding for single carrier frequency-division multiple access","sourcePdf":"015NOUNE LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040515S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5116787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5116787","articleId":"5116802","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5116805,"authors":[{"name":"Sassan Ahmadi","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Sassan Ahmadi [M'85, SM'07] (sassan.ahmadi@intel.com) received his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees, all in electrical engineering, in 1988, 1990, and 1997, respectively.

More and more base stations are serving smaller and smaller areas (cells) which in effect is driving up deployment costs. The option of deploying relay stations is increasingly beginning to look like a solution to the problem of providing a cost-effective way to extend the coverage and capacity in a cellular network. A relay station can be used to extend the point-to-multipoint link between the base station and mobile stations. Relay stations connect to the base stations without wires and are expected to be deployed to cover smaller geographic areas. Primarily the deployment costs but also the equipment costs are expected to be substantially lower than those of base stations. In this article we first introduce the relay station and discuss the place it is likely to carve out for itself in the traditional cellular architecture. We highlight the important economic and performance benefits relay stations could potentially offer, and outline a few scenarios where relays are likely to be deployed in the beginning. The multihop relay standard developed by the IEEE 802.16 working group is then used as a basis to provide an overview of the relay-enhanced cellular architecture and the key choices that can be made in developing relay support within a cellular system - a precursor to what can be expected in later releases of the Mobile WiMAX system. Finally, we discuss some future directions in the development of relay systems.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2009.5116808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/35/5116787/05116808.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2009.5116808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5116787","startPage":"115","endPage":"121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evolved cellular system architecture incorporating relay stations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5116808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An evolved cellular system architecture incorporating relay stations","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5116808/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"47","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10732293","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5116808/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evolved cellular system architecture incorporating relay stations","sourcePdf":"021SYDIR LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028031S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"5116787","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"5116787","articleId":"5116808","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5116811,"authors":[{"name":"Semin Sim","affiliation":["Yonsei University, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' biographies were unavailable when this issue went to press."]},"firstName":"Semin","lastName":"Sim","id":"37569096500"},{"name":"Seung-jae Han","affiliation":["Yonsei University, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-jae","lastName":"Han","id":"37291432500"},{"name":"Joon-sang Park","affiliation":["SK Telecom, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joon-sang","lastName":"Park","id":"38184549600"},{"name":"Seong-choon Lee","affiliation":["Korea Telecom, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-choon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37539842200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0163-6804"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1896"}],"articleNumber":"5116811","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":864},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","IP networks","Quality of service","Radio access networks","Communication system traffic control","Centralized control","Routing","Scalability","Telecommunication traffic","Radio control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","IP networks","mobile radio","transport protocols","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP mobility protocol support","IEEE 802.16e-based mobile WiMAX network","wireless Internet service","all-IP architecture","hierarchical architecture","flat architecture","ASN-GW","BS","NS-2 simulation"]}],"abstract":"The growing demand for wireless Internet services is accelerating the evolution of wireless networks toward all-IP architecture, and the mobile WiMAX network is a prominent example.

In this article we review the body-coupled communications technology, which we show to be a viable basis for future BANs. In BCC, the human body is used as a signal propagation medium, which provides a key benefit - the communication is centered around the user and limited to his or her close proximity, that is, this technology provides human-centric connectivity. This enables unique applications that are illustrated in this work. Moreover, we outline the fundamental properties of the BCC technology and provide different trade-offs and challenges for modulation and protocol design.

Special focus is given to the effect of the load resistor value on the vibrational amplitude of the piezoelectric EHD, and thus on the current, voltage, and power generated by the device, which are normally assumed to be independent of the load resistor value to reduce the complexity of modeling and simulation. The presented CPC-FEM uses a cantilever with a sandwich structure and a seismic mass attached to the tip to study the following characteristics of the EHD as a result of changing the load resistor value: 1) the electric outputs: the current through and voltage across the load resistor; 2) the power dissipated by the load resistor; 3) the displacement amplitude of the tip of the cantilever; and 4) the shift in the resonant frequency of the device. It is found that these characteristics of the EHD have a significant dependence on the load resistor value, rather than being independent of it as is assumed in most literature. The CPC-FEM is capable of predicting the generated output power of the EHD with different load resistor values while simultaneously calculating the effect of the load resistor value on the displacement amplitude of the tip of the cantilever. This makes the CPC-FEM invaluable for validating the performance of a designed EHD before it is fabricated and tested, thereby reducing the recurring costs associated with repeat fabrication and trials. In addition, the proposed CPC-FEM can also be used for producing an optimized design for maximum power output.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5116844/05116857.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2009.1187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5116844","startPage":"1309","endPage":"1317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyses of power output of piezoelectric energy-harvesting devices directly connected to a load resistor using a coupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5116857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analyses of power output of piezoelectric energy-harvesting devices directly connected to a load resistor using a coupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element method","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5116857/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10732304","pubMedId":"19574142","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5116857/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyses of power output of piezoelectric energy-harvesting devices directly connected to a load resistor using a coupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element method","sourcePdf":"t0971309.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062149S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5116844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5116844","articleId":"5116857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-13"},{"_id":5116874,"authors":[{"name":"S.

As a result, the dramatic improvement of the frequency usage efficiency can be expected. Since the cognitive radio system is independent from the license system, it should recognize the wireless communication parameter of the license system, such as frequency, modulation scheme, and so on. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, which can transmit multiple data signals with using single frequency spectrum, is applied to cognitive radio, and thus frequency use efficiency is more significantly improved. In MIMO-Cognitive Radio system, when new cognitive user tries to use the frequency resource, it is necessary that the new user should detect the number of parallel transmitted symbols which the license user transmit, because the new user should remove the interference signals whose number is the same as that of data symbol transmitted by the license user. In this paper, in MIMO-Cognitive Radio system, the novel method for recognizing the number of parallel data symbols is proposed.","doi":"10.1109/ISITA.2008.5117644","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4816040/4895364/05117644.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITA.2008.5117644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895364","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection method for recognizing number of parallel transmitted symbols in MIMO-cognitive wireless communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117644","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Detection method for recognizing number of parallel transmitted symbols in MIMO-cognitive wireless communication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117644/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5117644/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection method for recognizing number of parallel transmitted symbols in MIMO-cognitive wireless communication","confLoc":"Auckland, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"13749_Detection Method for Recognizing Number_missing in XPLORE 6-19-09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04792S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4816040","isNumber":"4895364","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816040","xplore-issue":"4895364","articleId":"5117644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5117678,"authors":[{"name":"Dimpesh Patel","affiliation":["The Edward S.

However, decomposition of complex MIMO channel matrices with large dimensions leads to high computational complexity, and hence results in either large core area or low throughput. Moreover, for mobile communication applications that involve fast-varying channels, it is required to perform QR decomposition with low processing latency. In this paper, we propose a hybrid QRD scheme that uses a combination of multi-dimensional Givens rotations, Householder transformations and the conventional two-dimensional (2D) Givens rotations to both reduce the overall computational complexity and achieve higher execution parallelism. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed QRD scheme, a novel pipelined architecture is presented that uses un-rolled pipelined CORDIC processors iteratively to maximize throughput and resource utilization, while minimizing the gate count. The architectures of the main data processing modules, namely the 2D, Householder 3D and 4D/2D configurable pipelined CORDIC processors, are also presented. Synthesis results for a 4times4 MIMO detector in 0.13 mum CMOS process indicate that this QRD design computes a 4times4 complex R matrix and four updated 4times1 complex symbol vectors every 40 cycles, at a clock frequency of 270 MHz and requires 36 K gates. The proposed design achieves the lowest processing time and the highest throughput reported to-date for the same framework.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117678","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117678.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","startPage":"33","endPage":"36","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity high-speed QR decomposition implementation for MIMO receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity high-speed QR decomposition implementation for MIMO receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117678/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760299","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5117678/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity high-speed QR decomposition implementation for MIMO receivers","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"009_1879.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044067S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5117686,"authors":[{"name":"SangBum Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"SangBum","lastName":"Kim","id":"37404962100"},{"name":"Yuan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Yuan Zhang","id":"37405811700"},{"name":"Byoungil Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Byoungil Lee","id":"37579188200"},{"name":"Marissa Caldwell","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Marissa","lastName":"Caldwell","id":"37581789700"},{"name":"H.-S.

Therefore, various new memory technologies are being widely researched and evaluated to continue the cost/performance improvement trend of solid state memory devices. To assess the potential scalability of emerging nanoscale memory beyond conventional limits, it is essential to characterize and understand how differently they perform at the nanoscale compared to known properties in the microscale. New nanoscale fabrication methods and new memory technologies offer a great opportunity for future memory device research. In this regard, we evaluated characteristics of nanoscale phase change memory and Ni oxide memory using nanofabrication technologies such as nanowire growth, nanocrystal synthesis, diblock copolymer patterning, and e-beam lithography. Evaluated characteristics include not only their device performance but also key material properties that might affect the ultimate device performance. The nanofabrication method for each memory material is also discussed due to its potential to overcome the difficulties of conventional semiconductor fabrication process.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fabrication and characterization of emerging nanoscale memory","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117686","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117686.pdf","startPage":"65","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Fabrication and characterization of emerging nanoscale memory","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5117686/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760307","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabrication and characterization of emerging nanoscale memory","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"017_2752.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095036S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5117691,"authors":[{"name":"G.

It is based on the pseudo-polar Fourier transform (PPFT) which evaluates the Fourier transform at points along rays equispaced in slope. We take some modifications on the arrangement of the euqispaced rays, making the two-dimensional (2D) PPFT grid to the Cartesian 2D discrete-Fourier transform grid. Then we apply one-dimensional (1D) filter banks (FBs) to the arranged PPFT along the slope direction. This can perform the decomposition of images into arbitrary directionally-oriented subbands. By using this method, the design of DFBs is reduced to that of 1D FBs, leading to the low design complexity and good design flexibility. Furthermore, by combining the proposed DFBs with Laplacian pyramid, we can achieve a multiscale and multidirection system. Experimental result is given to illustrate the proposed approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117691","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117691.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"88","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of nonsubsampled directional filter banks with arbitrary number of channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of nonsubsampled directional filter banks with arbitrary number of channels","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5117691/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760312","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117691/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of nonsubsampled directional filter banks with arbitrary number of channels","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"022_2632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052112S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5117700,"authors":[{"name":"Yeong-Luh Ueng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yeong-Luh","lastName":"Ueng","id":"37393144500"},{"name":"Yu-Lun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Lun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37579418700"},{"name":"Chi-Yu Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chi-Yu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37577438000"},{"name":"Jen-Yuan Hsu","affiliation":["SoC Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Yuan","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37285968200"},{"name":"Pangan Ting","affiliation":["SoC Technology Center, Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pangan Ting","id":"38523301900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5117700","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":513},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Message passing","Dynamic scheduling","Parity check codes","Iterative decoding","Phase change materials","Hardware","Computational complexity","Partitioning algorithms","Block codes","Niobium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","cyclic codes","decoding","message passing","parity check codes","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["layered message-passing decoding","dynamic scheduling","QC-LDPC codes","quasi cyclic low-density parity-check code","early termination strategy","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iterative decoding","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","layered decoding","early termination"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117700","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117700.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117700","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117700","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified layered message passing decoding with dynamic scheduling and early termination for QC-LDPC codes","abstract":"The convergence speed of layered message-passing decoding (LMPD) is faster than that of standard two phase message passing (TPMP) decoding.

The colour plus depth map stereoscopic video is coded with backward compatibility using a scalable video coding (SVC) architecture, where users with conventional video decoders/receivers can receive the conventional 2-D (three-dimensional) video stream whereas users with SVC decoders/receivers and necessary 3-D video displays may render 3-D video. The proposed error protection scheme is based on the perceptual importance of the coded 3-D video components. The UEP method allocates more protection to the colour video packets than the depth map packets in order to receive good quality 2-D/3-D video. The protection levels are assigned through allocating differentiated transmission power for colour and depth map video packets during transmission. On the fly power allocation is based on the estimated distortion of the colour image sequence.

In conventional CFO compensation methods for OFDMA systems, the CFOs are usually compensated for by directly eliminating the intercarrier interference (ICI) caused by the residual CFOs for individual users. Besides the ICI, the multiuser interference can be also introduced at the OFDMA receiver due to different CFO values for the users. From the theoretical and simulated analysis, we find that the mean square error performance of the demodulated output signal is related to a common CFO value which can be adjusted before the DFT. A new common CFO estimation method is then verified by numerical results to demonstrate that a better bit error rate performance can be obtained by using the proposed common CFO correction algorithm compared to conventional CFO compensation methods in OFDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117720","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117720.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of common carrier frequency offset at the OFDMA receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117720/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of common carrier frequency offset at the OFDMA receiver","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760421","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5117720/","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of common carrier frequency offset at the OFDMA receiver","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"051_1889.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034903S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5117721,"authors":[{"name":"Hai-Nam Nguyen","affiliation":["IRISA/INRIA, University of Rennes I, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Hai-Nam","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37577295600"},{"name":"Daniel Menard","affiliation":["IRISA/INRIA, University of Rennes I, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Menard","id":"37281694900"},{"name":"Olivier Sentieys","affiliation":["IRISA/INRIA, University of Rennes I, Lannion, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Sentieys","id":"37281694500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5117721","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Energy consumption","Digital signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","RAKE receivers","Modulation coding","Wireless communication","Fixed-point arithmetic","Fading","Multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","digital signal processing chips","fixed point arithmetic","low-power electronics","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic precision scaling","low power WCDMA receiver","digital signal processing","wireless communication","fixed-point arithmetic","energy consumption","power consumption","input receiver signal-to-noise ratio","energy saving","wideband code division multiple access"]}],"abstract":"One of the most important applications of digital signal processing (DSP) is wireless communication.

All 12 chemical synapses interconnecting the neurons also have individually programmable parameters defining conductance, reversal potential, and pre/post-synaptic voltage dependence of the channel kinetics. All configurable parameters in the implemented model have a biophysical origin, thus supporting direct interpretation of the results of adapting/tuning the parameters in terms of neurobiology.

In the writing mode, the voltage of the memory cell power line is reduced to ground gradually using a high-resistivity nMOSFET, and we turn off the nMOSFET so that the memory cell power line is set in a high-impedance state. Then, we can write data easily by inputting adiabatic signal from one bit line, while the other bit line is set to ground. For reading, a verifying operation is proposed for resolving the electromigration problem. The word line voltage is changed stepwise while the voltages of the bit lines are verified. The reading method enables a gradual current flow in the memory cell. We designed the cell layout and found that there is no area penalty. In addition, a new charge recycle circuit with tank capacitors is proposed.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117768.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adiabatic SRAM with a large margin of VT variation by controlling the cell-power-line and word-line voltage","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117768","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117768","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117768/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Adiabatic SRAM with a large margin of VT variation by controlling the cell-power-line and word-line voltage","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760547","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5117768/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adiabatic SRAM with a large margin of VT variation by controlling the cell-power-line and word-line voltage","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"099_1530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04367S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5117772,"authors":[{"name":"Maxim Piz","affiliation":["IHP Microelectronics GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Maxim","lastName":"Piz","id":"37395203000"},{"name":"Milos Krstic","affiliation":["IHP Microelectronics GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Milos","lastName":"Krstic","id":"37266672400"},{"name":"Marcus Ehrig","affiliation":["IHP Microelectronics GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Marcus","lastName":"Ehrig","id":"37395220500"},{"name":"Eckhard Grass","affiliation":["IHP Microelectronics GmbH, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Eckhard","lastName":"Grass","id":"37276988600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5117772","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Baseband","Bandwidth","Physical layer","Frequency synchronization","Channel estimation","Decoding","Hardware","Antennas and propagation","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband OFDM baseband receiver","short-range communication","digital front end","channel bandwidth","FPGA platform","radio link","frequency 60 GHz","bit rate 1.08 Gbit/s","bandwidth 400 MHz","frequency 100 MHz","bit rate 480 Mbit/s"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present implementation details of the digital front end of a wideband OFDM baseband receiver.

Furthermore, as the datarates of the wireless communication systems increase, larger transmission bandwidths (BW) and high-order modulated waveforms are applied. As a result, the systems are sensitive to frequency dependent I/Q-imbalance and the corresponding calibration is more challenging. Fortunately, efficient signal equalization is possible with OFDM, which is a widespread technique for broadband high datarate systems. Moreover, OFDM transceivers may have symmetrical transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) structures, typically in ad-hoc networks like WLAN. In this case, efficient and separate I/Q-imbalance parameter estimation in the Tx and the Rx is possible. Based on the considerations above, a new pilot-based self-calibration scheme is presented in this paper, which requires relatively low hardware overhead and signal processing complexity. Its effectiveness was verified by numerical simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient self-calibration of frequency-dependent I/Q-imbalance in direct-conversion OFDM transceivers","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117773","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117773.pdf","startPage":"413","endPage":"416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient self-calibration of frequency-dependent I/Q-imbalance in direct-conversion OFDM transceivers","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5117773/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760552","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient self-calibration of frequency-dependent I/Q-imbalance in direct-conversion OFDM transceivers","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"104_1046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080485S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5117774,"authors":[{"name":"Edwin C.

The compared results show that the 7-digit decimal exponential converter occupies 2.18 times more area and 1.66 times slower than the 24-bit binary FXP exponential converter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new decimal antilogarithmic converter","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117781","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117781.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A new decimal antilogarithmic converter","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5117781/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760599","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new decimal antilogarithmic converter","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"112_2313.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062804S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5117800,"authors":[{"name":"Kazeem Alagbe Gbolagade","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Kazeem Alagbe","lastName":"Gbolagade","id":"37400564600"},{"name":"Sorin Dan Cotofana","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Laboratory, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Sorin Dan","lastName":"Cotofana","id":"37277082000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5117800","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arithmetic","Digital signal processing","Concurrent computing","Image converters","Cathode ray tubes","Data conversion","Dynamic range","Laboratories","Application software","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","computational complexity","multiplying circuits","parallel algorithms","residue number systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["residue number system","mixed radix conversion algorithm","digital signal processing application","parallel MRC algorithm","prime integer moduli","modulo adder","modulo multiplier","RNS processor functional unit","iteration method","asymptotic complexity","arithmetic operation","integer number system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Residue Number System","Mixed Radix Conversion","Data Conversion","Mixed Radix Digits","arithmetic operations"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the conversion of residue number system (RNS) operands to decimal, which is an important issue concerning the utilization of RNS numbers in digital signal processing applications.

We propose a novel topology for a multiple carrier inductive link and compare two geometries for it. The orthogonal approach and the coplanar approach are these geometries. The principal challenge with multiple carriers is minimization of crosstalk, especially of power into data under lateral misalignment of the inner and outer coils. We show that a coplanar design allows keeping coupling of power into data under 15% with respect to the data coupling, even under lateral misalignments over 5 mm. In comparison, the orthogonal geometry reaches over 50% of parasitic coupling after a displacement of only 3 mm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10760661","htmlLink":"/document/5117804/","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Novel coils topology intended for biomedical implants with multiple carrier inductive link","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel coils topology intended for biomedical implants with multiple carrier inductive link","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"135_2226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070163S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5117806,"authors":[{"name":"Chutham Sawigun","affiliation":["Biomedical Electronics Group Electronics Research Laboratory DIMES, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Chutham","lastName":"Sawigun","id":"37299509800"},{"name":"Michiel Grashuis","affiliation":["Biomedical Electronics Group Electronics Research Laboratory DIMES, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Michiel","lastName":"Grashuis","id":"37088331081"},{"name":"Ralf Peeters","affiliation":["Mathematics Department MICC, University of Maastricht, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Peeters","id":"37425519100"},{"name":"Wouter Serdijn","affiliation":["Biomedical Electronics Group Electronics Research Laboratory DIMES, Delft University of Technnology, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Wouter","lastName":"Serdijn","id":"37270143900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5117806","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"abstract":"In order to realize a nano-power wavelet filter for biomedical applications, this paper applies the Singular Value Decomposition approximation to transform the time domain 1\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">st</sup>\n-derivative of a Gaussian (gauss1) wavelet base into a 5\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n-order z-domain transfer function.

To overcome the problem of unwanted noise at such a low signal level, a low-noise neural signal detection amplifier with low-frequency noise suppression scheme was developed utilizing a new autozeroing technique.

The proposed multiple-candidate selection process can mitigate the error propagation problem in the general QR-SIC detection, and therefore the detection probability is increased. This algorithm requires only 24% of the computational complexity of the V-BLAST, which is only slightly larger than that of the conventional QR-SIC algorithm. Besides, the proposed algorithm features high flexibility between the complexity and the performance, and it can even reach the performance of ML detection for the high performance system. Furthermore, the flexible selection approach requires no sorting operation like traditional K-best algorithm. Thus, a simple scalable VLSI architecture can be constructed for different MIMO configurations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117842.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"692","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scalable MIMO detection architecture with non-sorted multiple-candidate selection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Detection algorithms","Matrix decomposition","Very large scale integration","Transmitting antennas","Detectors","Receiving antennas","Computational complexity","Sorting","Additive white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","error statistics","matrix decomposition","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QR-based MIMO detection algorithm","nonsorted multiple-candidate selection process","error propagation mitigation problem","QR-SIC detection algorithm","detection probability","computational complexity","V-BLAST","ML detection","sorting operation","K-best algorithm","scalable VLSI architecture","matrix decomposition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A scalable MIMO detection architecture with non-sorted multiple-candidate selection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5117842/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760776","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scalable MIMO detection architecture with non-sorted multiple-candidate selection","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"173_1565.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047583S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5117843,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Fan","id":"37535952100"},{"name":"Chiu-Sing Choy","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chiu-Sing","lastName":"Choy","id":"37270085300"},{"name":"Ka Nang Leung","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ka Nang","lastName":"Leung","id":"37269821400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5117843","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"abstract":"Multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) ultra wideband (UWB) systems have drawn much attention for its high spectrum efficiency and multiple access capability.

Computer simulations show that by employing the proposed signal perturbation cancellation approach, the mean square error (MSE) of the SOS estimate can be sufficiently suppressed in the noisy case.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117845","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117845.pdf","startPage":"701","endPage":"704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An enhanced scheme for second-order-statistics estimation in MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117845/","displayDocTitle":"An enhanced scheme for second-order-statistics estimation in MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760779","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5117845/","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An enhanced scheme for second-order-statistics estimation in MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"176_1944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045824S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5117846,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Lung Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Lung","lastName":"Hung","id":"37575897000"},{"name":"Syu-Siang Long","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Syu-Siang","lastName":"Long","id":"37402677200"},{"name":"Muh-Tian Shiue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Muh-Tian","lastName":"Shiue","id":"37267328400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5117846","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":652},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Process design","MIMO","OFDM","Clocks","Fast Fourier transforms","Cache memory","Memory architecture","Testing","CMOS process","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","CMOS integrated circuits","digital arithmetic","fast Fourier transforms","integrated circuit design","low-power electronics","memory architecture","microprocessor chips","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power FFT processor design","variable-length FFT processor design","flexible MIMO OFDM system","fast Fourier transform","mixed-radix-2/4/8 algorithm","continuous-flow method","ping-pong cache memory architecture","optimized data scaling strategy","main memory access","QAM","CMOS","power consumption","size 0.18 mum","frequency 20 MHz","frequency 10 MHz"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a low power and variable-length design of fast Fourier transform (FFT) processor for flexible MIMO-OFDM applications.

The proposed 2D DWT architecture consists of a 1D row processor, internal memory, and a 1D column processor. The main advantage of this 2D DWT is to reduce the internal memory requirement significantly. For an NtimesN image, only 2N and 4N sizes of internal memory are required for the 5/3 and 9/7 filters, respectively, to perform the one-level 2D DWT decomposition. Moreover, it supports both lossless and lossy operation for 5/3 and 9/7 filters with high operation speed. The proposed 2D DWT surpasses the existed lifting-based designs in the aspects of low internal memory requirement.

This demonstration shows how a pair of spike-based silicon retina dynamic vision sensors (DVS) is used to provide fast visual feedback for controlling an actuated table to balance an ordinary pencil. Two DVSs view the pencil from right angles. Movements of the pencil cause spike address-events (AEs) to be emitted from the DVSs. These AEs are transmitted to a PC over USB interfaces and are processed procedurally in real time. The PC updates its estimate of the pencil's location and angle in 3d space upon each incoming AE, applying a novel tracking method based on spike-driven fitting to a model of the vertical shape of the pencil. A PD-controller adjusts X-Y-position and velocity of the table to maintain the pencil balanced upright. The controller also minimizes the deviation of the pencil's base from the center of the table. The actuated table is built using ordinary high-speed hobby servos which have been modified to obtain feedback from linear position encoders via a microcontroller. Our system can balance any small, thin object such as a pencil, pen, chop-stick, or rod for many minutes. Balancing is only possible when incoming AEs are processed as they arrive from the sensors, typically at intervals below millisecond ranges. Controlling at normal image sensor sample rates (e.g. 60 Hz) results in too long latencies for a stable control loop.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117867","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117867.pdf","startPage":"781","endPage":"784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A pencil balancing robot using a pair of AER dynamic vision sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117867/","displayDocTitle":"A pencil balancing robot using a pair of AER dynamic vision sensors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760839","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5117867/","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A pencil balancing robot using a pair of AER dynamic vision sensors","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"198_1893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050372S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":5117872,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, the precision in various image capture devices limits the color bit-depth and introduces loss in visual quality. Expanding the color bit-depth is an important image enhancement issue. A good bit-depth expansion system manipulates low color bit-depth image for best visual quality as displayed on high color bit-depth monitors. However, in most color bit-depth expansion algorithms, severe contouring effect is observed in smooth gradient area which degrades the visual quality. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed. By considering the distance from contour edges, fine gradient value are applied to fill the contour gaps to achieve gradual transaction.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117913","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117913.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","startPage":"944","endPage":"947","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-depth expansion by contour region reconstruction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117913","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bit-depth expansion by contour region reconstruction","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117913/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760955","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5117913/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-depth expansion by contour region reconstruction","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"244_2267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078581S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5117918,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Danesh","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Electronics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Seyed","lastName":"Danesh","id":"38181199100"},{"name":"Will Holland","affiliation":["Gigle Semiconductor Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Will","lastName":"Holland","id":"37578310400"},{"name":"Jed Hurwitz","affiliation":["Gigle Semiconductor Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Jed","lastName":"Hurwitz","id":"37268635900"},{"name":"Keith Findlater","affiliation":["Gigle Semiconductor Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Findlater","id":"37569907600"},{"name":"Robert Henderson","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Electronics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Henderson","id":"37294086900"},{"name":"David Renshaw","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Electronics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Renshaw","id":"37273758100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5117918","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal resolution","Wideband","Bandwidth","Capacitance","Attenuation","Calibration","OFDM modulation","CMOS technology","Transmitters","Dynamic range"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["7-bit flash A/D converter","wideband OFDM signal conversion","CMOS technology","analog front end","receiver bandwidth","input capacitance-reducing technique","comparator input pair","calibration strategies","signal-to-noise ratio","analog to digital convertor","frequency 1 GHz","size 90 nm"]}],"abstract":"A 1 GHz 7-bits flash A/D converter is fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology to be used as part of an analog front end (AFE) for digitising of OFDM communication signals.

The analysis identifies two contributors of the total sampling uncertainty: the input signal-dependent one and the substrate noise-related one. The two disturbances of the ideal operation of the sampling transistors cause a non-uniform sampling operation, whose properties depend on the frequencies of the disturbing signals. The non-uniform sampling introduces distortion components mainly at the harmonics of each interference signal, and other components located at frequencies related to the spectral content of the interference signals and the sampling frequency. The experimental results indicate that the developed model manages to capture accurately all the aforementioned distortion components in the presence of any input and any substrate noise signal, and therefore to predict the overall sampling distortion power.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117919","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117919.pdf","startPage":"968","endPage":"971","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of non-uniform sampling distortion due to substrate noise coupling in regenerative comparators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of non-uniform sampling distortion due to substrate noise coupling in regenerative comparators","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5117919/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760961","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117919/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of non-uniform sampling distortion due to substrate noise coupling in regenerative comparators","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"250_2212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058538S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5117920,"authors":[{"name":"Binhee Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Binhee Kim","id":"37087352528"},{"name":"Long Yan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Long Yan","id":"37087171858"},{"name":"Jerald Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jerald","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37292165500"},{"name":"Namjun Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Namjun Cho","id":"37087185411"},{"name":"Hoi-Jun Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hoi-Jun","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37274307200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5117920","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1068},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Sampling methods","Capacitance","Capacitors","Energy consumption","Voltage","Energy resolution","Switches","Wireless sensor networks","Delta-sigma modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","digital-analogue conversion","sample and hold circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient dual sampling SAR ADC","reduced capacitive DAC","MSB cycling step","sampling and holding","switching energy distribution","successive approximation register"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117920","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117920.pdf","startPage":"972","endPage":"975","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy-efficient dual sampling SAR ADC with reduced capacitive DAC","abstract":"This paper presents an energy-efficient SAR ADC which adopts reduced MSB cycling step with dual sampling of the analog signal.

The multiplexer based interconnect matrix of an FPGA consumes most of the static power consumption. This paper investigates reducing leakage power in unused FPGA routing multiplexers by controlling their inputs at the deep submicron 22 nm technology node. HSPICE simulation using Berkeley Predictive technology models (BPTM) on different sizes and topologies of routing multiplexers show that the minimum leakage vector at the 22 nm technology node significantly varies from that at 65 nm node. This is due to higher gate leakage and output stage loading effects. The application of this vector results in 20% more leakage power saving as compared to the existing approaches. This technique saves significant leakage power because most of the routing multiplexers are unused in an FPGA. Moreover, there is no area overhead contrary to the existing approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leakage reduction in FPGA routing multiplexers","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117959","startPage":"1129","endPage":"1132","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117959.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Leakage reduction in FPGA routing multiplexers","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5117959/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761039","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leakage reduction in FPGA routing multiplexers","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"290-1757.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05015S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5117960,"authors":[{"name":"Anthony T.

Also, we revisit an earlier proposed multiplier for 16 points and show that the complexity can be reduced by using minimum adder constant multipliers compared with the earlier proposed CSD-based multipliers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity reconfigurable complex constant multiplication for FFTs","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117961","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117961.pdf","startPage":"1137","endPage":"1140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5117961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity reconfigurable complex constant multiplication for FFTs","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5117961/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761041","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity reconfigurable complex constant multiplication for FFTs","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"292-2239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082303S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5117970,"authors":[{"name":"Bernard Pilloud","affiliation":["Cellular Systems Division, ST-NXP Wireless, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Pilloud","id":"37395090600"},{"name":"Willem H.

In this field, one of the most exciting areas is the simulation of fluid flow, which involves for example problems of air, sea and land vehicle motion. In engineering applications the temporal evolution of non-ideal, compressible fluids is quite often modeled by the system of Navier-Stokes equations. They are a coupled set of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations and form a relatively simple, yet efficient model of compressible fluid dynamics. Unfortunately the necessity of the coupled multi-layered computational structure with nonlinear, space-variant templates does not make it possible to utilize the huge computing power of the analog cellular neural network universal machine (CNN-UM) chips. To improve the performance of our solution emulated digital CNN-UM implemented on IBM cell broadband engine has been used.

The proposed CAVLC decoder can also easily meet real-time requirements for high definition (HD) (1920times1080) applications, while the clock speed is operated only at 13 MHz under the best case scenario.","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05117984.pdf","startPage":"1229","endPage":"1232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117984","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117984","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity and high throughput VLSI architecture for AVC/H.264 CAVLC decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity and high throughput VLSI architecture for AVC/H.264 CAVLC decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5117984/","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5117984/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760275","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity and high throughput VLSI architecture for AVC/H.264 CAVLC decoding","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"315-1980.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068945S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5117984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5117990,"authors":[{"name":"Tung-Chien Chen","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA","National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tung-Chien","lastName":"Chen","id":"37276681700"},{"name":"Wentai Liu","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Wentai Liu","id":"37279763700"},{"name":"Liang-Gee Chen","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Liang-Gee","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280381000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5117990","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Signal processing algorithms","Feature extraction","Hardware","Neurons","Prosthetics","Electrodes","Event detection","Principal component analysis","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","prosthetics","signal processing equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["128-channel spike sorting processor","parallel-folding structure","neural prostheses","realtime signal processing algorithms","large dynamic power","data caching","size 90 nm","power 1.87 mW"]}],"abstract":"An emerging class of neural prostheses aims to provide more aggressive performance by realizing advanced realtime signal processing algorithms in particular the spike sorting on chips.

Due to their complexity and huge design space to explore for such systems, CAD tools and frameworks to customize MPSoCs are mandatory. Some academic and industrial frameworks are available to support bus-based MPSoCs, but few works target NoCs as underlying communication architecture. A framework targeting MPSoC customization must provide abstract models to enable fast design space exploration, flexible application mapping strategies, all coupled to features to evaluate the performance of running applications. This paper proposes a framework to customize NoC-based MPSoCs with support to static and dynamic task mapping and C/SystemC simulation models for processors and memories. A simple, specifically designed microkernel executes in each processor, enabling multitasking at the processor level. Graphical tools enable debug and system verification, individualizing data for each task. Practical results highlight the benefit of using dynamic mapping strategies (total execution time reduction) and abstract models (total simulation time reduction without losing accuracy).","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118013.pdf","startPage":"1345","endPage":"1348","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5118013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HeMPS - a framework for NoC-based MPSoC generation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space exploration","Network-on-a-chip","Plasma applications","Plasma materials processing","Design automation","Software design","Hardware design languages","Embedded system","Communication industry","Multitasking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit complexity","circuit simulation","computer graphic equipment","embedded systems","logic design","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NoC-based MPSoC generation","multiprocessor systems-on-chip","embedded system","CAD tool","communication architecture","dynamic task mapping","static task mapping","SystemC simulation model","graphical tool","system verification","abstract model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"HeMPS - a framework for NoC-based MPSoC generation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5118013/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760382","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HeMPS - a framework for NoC-based MPSoC generation","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"344-1453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.146586S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5118014,"authors":[{"name":"Woojoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"lastName":"Woojoon Lee","id":"37577485300"},{"name":"Gerald E.

A 2D-mesh topology is one of the most frequently mentioned topologies for an NoC design due to its natural layout mapping onto an SoC. However, the 2D-mesh topology NoC has a hot-spot problem at the center of the network and presents difficulties in multicasting. In this paper, we propose a novel multicastable CDMA switch and an efficient mesh-star hybrid topology. This approach leads to reduced traffic at the center of the network and better performance with multicasting.

However these generators have been known to be insecure. The proposed PRBG couples four such LCGs and is secure. A preliminary proof of security is outlined in this paper. The PRBG generates bit-sequences that pass all NIST pseudo randomness tests. Our PRBG has a very efficient hardware implementation because the modulo operation is with respect to 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n as opposed to p times q in the blum-blum-shub (BBS) generator, where p and q are large prime numbers. We also show that the hardware implementation can be easily pipelined, thereby increasing the throughput in spite of the hardware having large word-length inputs (n ges 128). A 4-stage pipelined hardware was implemented in VHDL for n = 128 and the synthesized hardware was simulated. Simulation results showed a 2.81 fold increase in throughput (number of pseudo-random bits output per unit time) compared to the non-pipelined version.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118025","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118025.pdf","startPage":"1393","endPage":"1396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient hardware implementation of a new pseudo-random bit sequence generator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Efficient hardware implementation of a new pseudo-random bit sequence generator","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760394","htmlLink":"/document/5118025/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient hardware implementation of a new pseudo-random bit sequence generator","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"356-2706.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049341S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5118028,"authors":[{"name":"Ren-Hao Lai","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ren-Hao","lastName":"Lai","id":"37574028700"},{"name":"Cheng-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37578939600"},{"name":"Pang-An Ting","affiliation":["Industrial Technology and Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pang-An","lastName":"Ting","id":"38523301900"},{"name":"Yuan-Hao Huang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Hao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37404504600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5118028","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":586},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel processing","MIMO","Hardware","OFDM","Throughput","Sorting","Computational modeling","Parallel algorithms","Concurrent computing","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","error statistics","iterative methods","matrix decomposition","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","parallel algorithms","signal detection","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sorted-QR decomposition algorithm","parallel processing","MIMO channel","high-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output detection","OFDM subcarrier","Givens-rotation-based algorithm","cross-column parallel rotation operation","parallel algorithm","BER","antenna array","iterative method"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a modified sorted-QR decomposition algorithm for the high-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection. Due to the growing demands of high-dimension MIMO channels and large number of OFDM subcarriers, the sorted-QR decomposition becomes one of the computational bottlenecks in the QR-based MIMO detection. The proposed Givens-rotation-based algorithm aims to improve the throughput and the hardware utilization efficiency by relaxing the sorting condition and allowing the cross-column parallel rotation operations. The simulation results show that our proposed parallel algorithm can significantly reduce the minimal computation latency from 28% to 21% of the original algorithm, and the hardware utilization rate can be enhanced from 71% to 90% for 16times16 MIMO using four Given-rotation processing elements. The detection performance degradation is negligible and better hardware efficiency can be obtained for the larger number of MIMO antennas.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118028","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118028.pdf","startPage":"1405","endPage":"1408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified sorted-QR decomposition algorithm for parallel processing in MIMO detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5118028","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118028/","displayDocTitle":"A modified sorted-QR decomposition algorithm for parallel processing in MIMO detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760437","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5118028/","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified sorted-QR decomposition algorithm for parallel processing in MIMO detection","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"359-1564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050917S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":5118035,"authors":[{"name":"A.

By taking advantage of the real-valued operation of FHT, this approach can reduce the number of multiplications compared with the radix-2 FFT.

The proposed method employs a unique true motion engine that explores at most nine motion candidates with different motion directions and then determines one true motion by referring to neighboring spatial information as well as temporal information. Besides, the proposed method introduces an adaptive overlapped block matching algorithm to enhance the searching accuracy and visual quality.

The proposed method is implemented by an Altera Stratix II FPGA development kit and the results show excellent performance match with those by Matlab software simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118116","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118116.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","startPage":"1759","endPage":"1762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity hardware implementation of discrete-time frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5118116","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity hardware implementation of discrete-time frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118116/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760683","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5118116/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity hardware implementation of discrete-time frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"447-2683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08649S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5118127,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Jun Kim","affiliation":["Department of EECS, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Jun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406984000"},{"name":"Kyusik Chung","affiliation":["Department of EECS, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyusik","lastName":"Chung","id":"37406959100"},{"name":"Lee-Sup Kim","affiliation":["Department of EECS, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Lee-Sup","lastName":"Kim","id":"37278168900"},{"name":"Seong Mo Park","affiliation":["SoC Research Department, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong Mo","lastName":"Park","id":"37337017800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5118127","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"abstract":"A table loader unit with bank-partition and multi-fetch feature is proposed for multiple special function units in multi-core systems.

In this paper, we propose concurrently testable FPGA design for molecular QCA using conservative reversible Fredkin gate. Fredkin gate is conservative reversible in nature, in which there would be an equal number of 1s in the outputs as there would be on the inputs, in addition to one-to-one mapping. Fault patterns in Fredkin gate are analyzed using HDLQ tool due to a single missing/additional cell defect in molecular QCA. Exhaustive simulation shows that if there is a fault in molecular QCA implementation of Fredkin gate, there is a parity mismatch between the inputs and the outputs; otherwise the inputs parity is same as outputs parity. Thus, any permanent and transient fault in molecular QCA that results in parity mismatch can be concurrently detected. The logic block and the routing fabric (both are programmable) are the two key components of an FPGA. Thus, we have shown the Fredkin gate based concurrently testable designs of the configurable logic block (CLB) and the routing switch of a molecular QCA-based FPGA. Analysis of power dissipation in the proposed FPGA is also shown.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118130","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118130.pdf","startPage":"1815","endPage":"1818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concurrently testable FPGA design for molecular QCA using conservative reversible logic gate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Concurrently testable FPGA design for molecular QCA using conservative reversible logic gate","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5118130/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760736","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrently testable FPGA design for molecular QCA using conservative reversible logic gate","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"461-1934.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103238S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5118136,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Chun Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Chun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37422184000"},{"name":"Muh-Tian Shiue","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Muh-Tian","lastName":"Shiue","id":"37267328400"},{"name":"Shyh-Jye Jou","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyh-Jye","lastName":"Jou","id":"37270102100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5118136","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":383},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Finite impulse response filter","Field-flow fractionation","Throughput","Hardware","Feedback loop","Adders","Multiplexing","Control systems","Niobium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback equalisers","filtering theory","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","multiplexing equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback equalizer","dynamic lookahead decision loop","post-cursor ISI cancellation","feedback path","multigigabit DFE design","paralleled subcircuit","multiplexer-based lookahead DFE","feedback filter DFE comparison","parallelization factor","bit rate 10 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"Decision feedback equalizer (DFE) uses a feedback path to cancel post-cursor ISI, and this feedback path will also cause the limitation of its maximum throughput rate.

The use of frequency-domain methods to analyze the steady-state of switched circuits is usually restricted to linear circuits and, although Volterra series approaches are applied to the distortion of nonlinear switched circuits, the use of harmonic balance (HB) methods in nonlinear switched circuits seems to be marginal if not discarded. In this paper, we analyze the nonlinear class-E amplifier with an ideal switch by means of the HB method. We show how the switching function may be carefully chosen to improve the accuracy of the solution. When the circuit achieves actual class-E operation, the method converges better and is more accurate than classical time-domain methods. We conclude that the HB method is an alternative to time-domain methods that can be used to analyze the class-E amplifier in its expected operation mode.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118147","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118147.pdf","startPage":"1883","endPage":"1886","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The nonlinear class-E amplifier: A case study of harmonic balance applied to switched circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"The nonlinear class-E amplifier: A case study of harmonic balance applied to switched circuits","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5118147/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760790","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118147/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The nonlinear class-E amplifier: A case study of harmonic balance applied to switched circuits","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"478-1017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053059S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5118157,"authors":[{"name":"Jayram Moorkanikara Nageswaran","affiliation":["Center of Embedded Systems, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Jayram Moorkanikara","lastName":"Nageswaran","id":"37569762300"},{"name":"Nikil Dutt","affiliation":["Center of Embedded Systems, Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, University of California, Irvine, USA"],"firstName":"Nikil","lastName":"Dutt","id":"37265889400"},{"name":"Yingxue Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"lastName":"Yingxue Wang","id":"37540233200"},{"name":"Tobi Delbrueck","affiliation":["Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Tobi","lastName":"Delbrueck","id":"37569763100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5118157","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":278},"abstract":"In spiking neural networks, asynchronous spike events are processed in parallel by neurons.

The class D output stage reduces the non-linearities and supply noise by means of a second-order negative feedback loop embodying a single stage second-order integrator and a Schmitt trigger comparator. Unlike conventional feedback, the reference input signal of the feedback loop is a digital pulse width modulated signal. The feedback loop compensates for any external errors or non-linearities in the output PWM signal by modulating the pulse width of the output signal. Based on simulation using AMS 0.35 mum CMOS process, our proposed closed-loop output stage can achieve a PSRR of .90 dB at 1 kHz and a THD well below 0.05% up to 10 kHz.

The analysis starts with a general assumption that the time-varying delay may be expressed as the lower bound plus the length of an interval over which the delay varies. Then the delay partitioning technique is used to establish a new delay-dependent sufficient condition under which the asymptotic stability of recurrent neural networks with time-varying delay can be guaranteed. The new stability criterion takes the form of linear matrix inequalities, thus lending itself to being readily checkable by the available software package. The obtained theoretical result is further illustrated by numerical results, including their superiority over the existing results on asymptotic stability of delayed recurrent neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118215","startPage":"2125","endPage":"2128","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118215.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of asymptotic stability for delayed recurrent neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118215/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A study of asymptotic stability for delayed recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5118215/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10760945","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of asymptotic stability for delayed recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"546-1395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078828S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5118220,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng-Yu Peng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Sheng-Yu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37290989000"},{"name":"Gokce Gurun","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Gokce","lastName":"Gurun","id":"38505184000"},{"name":"Christopher M.

In this paper, an optimization method for the structural adders in the transposed tapped delay line is proposed. Although additional registers are required, an optimal trade-off can be made such that the overall combinational logic is reduced. For a majority of taps, the delay through the structural adder is shortened except for the last tap. The one full adder delay increase for the last optimized tap is tolerable as it does not fall in the critical path in most cases. The criterion for which area reduction is possible is analytically derived and an area reduction of up to 4.5% for the structural adder block of three benchmark filters is estimated theoretically. The saving is more prominent as the number of taps grows. Actual synthesis results obtained by synopsys design compiler with 0.18 mum TSMC CMOS libraries show a total area reduction of up to 13.13% when combined with common subexpression elimination. In all examples, up to 11.96% of the total area saved were due to the reduction of structural adder costs by our proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118230","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118230.pdf","startPage":"2185","endPage":"2188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of structural adders in fixed coefficient transposed direct form FIR filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5118230","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118230/","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of structural adders in fixed coefficient transposed direct form FIR filters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760979","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5118230/","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of structural adders in fixed coefficient transposed direct form FIR filters","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"561-1212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038061S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5118231,"authors":[{"name":"Seisuke Kyochi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Seisuke","lastName":"Kyochi","id":"37569663700"},{"name":"Toshiyuki Uto","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Ehime University, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshiyuki","lastName":"Uto","id":"37281531500"},{"name":"Masaaki Ikehara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaaki","lastName":"Ikehara","id":"37268595300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5118231","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Filter bank","Finite impulse response filter","Discrete wavelet transforms","Prototypes","Image processing","Design engineering","Computer science","Signal processing","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cosine-sine modulated filter bank","dual-tree complex wavelet transform","shift-invariance","directional selectivity","M-band DTCWT"]}],"abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to show an another design approach of the M-band dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCopfWT).

In this paper, these properties are verified by theoretical analysis and demonstrations.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118231","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118231.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","startPage":"2189","endPage":"2192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-tree complex wavelet transform arising from cosine-sine modulated filter banks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5118231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dual-tree complex wavelet transform arising from cosine-sine modulated filter banks","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118231/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760980","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5118231/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-tree complex wavelet transform arising from cosine-sine modulated filter banks","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"562-1241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068113S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5118234,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["Centre of Signal Processing School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37577940400"},{"name":"Wee Ser","affiliation":["Centre of Signal Processing School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wee","lastName":"Ser","id":"37271375600"},{"name":"Karthik Muralidhar","affiliation":["R & D Department, STMicroelectronics, Singapore"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Muralidhar","id":"37578762300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5118234","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Design engineering","Signal design","Optimization methods","Microphone arrays","Signal synthesis","Frequency synthesizers","Signal processing","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","frequency selective surfaces","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uniform circular broadband beamformer","spatial invariant region","frequency-invariant beamformer algorithm","array beampattern response","array gain response","objective function","selective frequency invariant region","second order cone programming","complex optimization problem","low mean square error method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5118234","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118234","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","abstract":"Most existing frequency-invariant (FI) beamformer algorithms design array beampattern response across the entire frequency bands. In this paper, the design of array gain response is extended to both selective frequency and spatial region. The algorithm consists of an objective function that has a two-dimensional constraint. One dimension constraint is on frequency range; this is to ensure a selective frequency invariant region is formed. The second dimension constraint is on spatial direction; this is to maintain the array response of the beamformer constant for a small amount of angle centered at the desired direction. Having such constant gain response over a selective spatial region makes the array beamformer less sensitive to the exact position of the source. Advanced optimization method such as second order cone programming (SOCP) is used to solve this complex optimization problem with high efficiency and accuracy. Simulation results are compared with other existing algorithms. It demonstrates that the proposed method is able to achieve a constant gain over the specified sector of angle and at the same time having a lower mean square error on the FI performance over the specified frequency region.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","startPage":"2201","endPage":"2204","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118234.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uniform circular broadband beamformer with selective frequency and spatial invariant region","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5118234/","displayDocTitle":"Uniform circular broadband beamformer with selective frequency and spatial invariant region","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760983","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uniform circular broadband beamformer with selective frequency and spatial invariant region","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"565-1742.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052628S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5118242,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Jin","id":"37579026800"},{"name":"Chi-Ying Tsui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chi-Ying","lastName":"Tsui","id":"37278549800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5118242","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Parity check codes","Decoding","Parallel architectures","Computer architecture","Processor scheduling","Costs","Throughput","Matrix decomposition","Simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","matrix decomposition","parallel architectures","parity check codes","scheduling","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partially parallel LDPC decoding architecture","low density parity check code","scheduling problem","submatrix decomposition","HUE","hardware utilization efficiency","check node processor unit","variable node processor unit","optimization problem","simulated annealing"]}],"abstract":"Partially parallel LDPC decoder is commonly used for practical applications due to its good tradeoff between the hardware cost and the throughput. In the partially parallel LDPC decoding architecture, two kinds of processor units are implemented: check node unit (CNU) and variable node unit (VNU). Because of the dependency between two kinds of processor units, the low hardware utilization efficiency (HUE) is one of the design issues for the partially parallel decoding architecture. In order to achieve the optimal hardware utilization efficiency, it is important to determine the order of the rows and columns in the LDPC parity check matrix processed by the processor units. In this paper, we model the scheduling problem as an optimization problem and use simulated annealing to find good solutions for the scheduling. In order to further increase the HUE of the partially parallel decoding architecture, sub-matrix decomposition scheme is proposed. By applying these two schemes, the HUE of some partially parallel decoding implementations can achieve 100%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the hardware utilization efficiency of partially parallel LDPC decoder with scheduling and sub-matrix decomposition","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118242","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118242.pdf","startPage":"2233","endPage":"2236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5118242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Improving the hardware utilization efficiency of partially parallel LDPC decoder with scheduling and sub-matrix decomposition","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5118242/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761009","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the hardware utilization efficiency of partially parallel LDPC decoder with scheduling and sub-matrix decomposition","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"573-2201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057269S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5118247,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Hossein Maghami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Hossein","lastName":"Maghami","id":"37569667100"},{"name":"Mohammad Yavari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Yavari","id":"37269863600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5118247","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":363},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delta-sigma modulation","Wideband","Frequency","Signal sampling","Bandwidth","Energy consumption","Clocks","Signal processing","Sampling methods","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","sigma-delta modulation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling frequency","CT-DT sigma-delta modulator","amplifier bandwidth","wideband application","power consumption","multirate signal processing","discrete-time modulator","continuous-time modulator","multirate double-sampling cascaded hybrid modulator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5118247","abstract":"As the sampling frequency in modulators is upper limited by the amplifier bandwidth and power consumption, sigma-delta modulators should operate with low oversampling ratios (OSRs) in broadband applications.

The technique involves conversion of a DNA character sequence into a numerical sequence using the electron-ion interaction potential values and then filtering the numerical sequence using a narrowband bandpass digital filter whose passband is centered at the period-3 frequency, i.e., 2pi/3. The strength of the bandpass-filtered signal as a function of nucleotide location is then detected using a lowpass filter. A plot of the signal power versus location reveals the presence of exons as distinct peaks. Simulations have shown that the technique leads to more accurate exon locations than another computational technique based on the short-time discrete Fourier transform. Furthermore, the amount of computation required is reduced by as much as 97 percent thereby rendering the technique suitable for the processing of long DNA sequences, even complete genomes.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118268","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118268.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","startPage":"2337","endPage":"2340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location of exons in DNA sequences using digital filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5118268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Location of exons in DNA sequences using digital filters","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118268/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10761054","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5118268/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location of exons in DNA sequences using digital filters","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"599-2053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074317S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5118269,"authors":[{"name":"Ut-Va Koc","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ut-Va","lastName":"Koc","id":"37272601200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5118269","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Adaptive optics","Optical polarization","Adaptive equalizers","Phase shift keying","Optical fiber communication","Optical modulation","High speed optical techniques","Bandwidth","Adaptive algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","light coherence","optical fibre communication","optical fibre dispersion","optical fibre polarisation","optical modulation","optical receivers","optical tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive PLL-free optical coherent receiver","joint polarization tracking","equalization","phase-shift-keying","optical communication","on-off-keying modulation","phase-locked-loop","chromatic dispersion","polarization mode dispersion","bit rate 40 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"Existing on-off-keying modulation in optical communication becomes inadequate to meet exponentially growing bandwidth demand.

The approach allows to make an estimation of the tuning range, a stability analysis and a nonlinear calculation of the amplitude before the actual design phase. With our approach the VCO can be optimized regarding the requested amplitude specification and minimizing the effect of the higher harmonics. Using a charge based approximation for the voltage dependent varactor capacitance we obtain an analytical expression to model the large signal oscillator capacitance in dependency of the design parameters and the tuning voltage valid at any time of oscillation. The validity of the method has been verified by designing a 2.4 GHz VCO using 0.25 mum RF CMOS technology.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118281","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118281.pdf","startPage":"2389","endPage":"2392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A nonlinear systematic design flow for LC tank VCOs based on large signal capacitance modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A nonlinear systematic design flow for LC tank VCOs based on large signal capacitance modeling","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760279","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5118281/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A nonlinear systematic design flow for LC tank VCOs based on large signal capacitance modeling","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"612-1871.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051577S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5118286,"authors":[{"name":"Yat-To Wong","affiliation":["Portable Analog & Mixed Signal Design, IC Designs Group, Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yat-To","lastName":"Wong","id":"37085512723"},{"name":"Chik-Wai Ng","affiliation":["Portable Analog & Mixed Signal Design, IC Designs Group, Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chik-Wai","lastName":"Ng","id":"37578339400"},{"name":"Ho-Ming Wan","affiliation":["Portable Analog & Mixed Signal Design, IC Designs Group, Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ho-Ming","lastName":"Wan","id":"37569920100"},{"name":"Kwok-Kuen Kwong","affiliation":["Portable Analog & Mixed Signal Design, IC Designs Group, Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kwok-Kuen","lastName":"Kwong","id":"37580508000"},{"name":"Yat-Hei Lam","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yat-Hei","lastName":"Lam","id":"37283661800"},{"name":"Wing-Hung Ki","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wing-Hung","lastName":"Ki","id":"37269638700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5118286","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":723},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5118286","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Driver circuits","Threshold voltage","Capacitors","Oscillators","Neodymium","Signal design","CMOS technology","CMOS process","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","error analysis","power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near-threshold startup-integrated boost converter","slew rate","error amplifier","CMOS process","near-threshold soft-start circuit","maximum in-rush current","capacitor multiplier","compensation capacitor","voltage 0.9 V","size 0.6 mum","voltage 0.7 V","voltage 0.8 V","power 260 mW"]}],"abstract":"An integrated voltage-mode boost converter that starts up at 0.9 V is successfully implemented in a standard 3.3/5 V 0.6 mum CMOS process with V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tn</sub>\n=0.7 V and |V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">tp</sub>\n|=0.8 V.

Owing to this extension, the electrical property of the active switch in a Class-E circuit is taken as a special kind of impedance. Consequently, it is possible to regard a whole Class-E circuit as combination of impedances, whose total impedance is obtainable according to the existing circuit laws. When subjected to a DC supply voltage, the steady-state response of the total impedance can be directly obtained with the Ohm's law, regardless of the transient state. In addition, based on the formulation, regarding maximum power conversion efficiency as its design objective, Class-E optimization is also carried out. Since no waveform equation is required for both simulation and optimization, these simulation and optimization are more concise and efficient than those in all of the previous studies.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118307","startPage":"2493","endPage":"2496","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118307.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation and optimization of class-E power amplifiers with extended impedance method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Simulation and optimization of class-E power amplifiers with extended impedance method","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5118307/","accessionNumber":"10760344","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118307/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation and optimization of class-E power amplifiers with extended impedance method","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"638-1121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049456S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5118311,"authors":[{"name":"Ta-Wen Kuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ta-Wen","lastName":"Kuan","id":"37575021000"},{"name":"Jhing-Fa Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jhing-Fa","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280532500"},{"name":"Jia-Ching Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jia-Ching","lastName":"Wang","id":"37292902200"},{"name":"Gaung-Hui Gu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Gaung-Hui","lastName":"Gu","id":"37577536000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5118311","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":248},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Algorithm design and analysis","Design optimization","Support vector machines","Field programmable gate arrays","Chip scale packaging","Intellectual property","System testing","Prototypes","Cyclones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","field programmable gate arrays","industrial property","integrated circuit design","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation","support vector machines","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI design","sequential minimal optimization algorithm","SVM learning","support vector machine","intellectual property","SVM-based recognition system","Cyclone II 2C70 FPGA","field-programmable gate array"]}],"abstract":"The sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm has been widely used for training the support vector machine (SVM).

Among practical ASD algorithms, the low-complexity chase (LCC) algorithm can achieve similar or higher coding gain with lower complexity. The major steps of ASD algorithms are the interpolation and factorization. Applying the re-encoding and coordinate transformation, the complexity of these two steps can be greatly reduced at the cost of an extra hard-decision decoder. Backward interpolation has been proposed to enable the sharing of intermediate results among the multiple interpolations of the LCC decoding. However, not much work has been done on further optimizing the factorization step, which consumes a significant proportion of the area and can become a speed bottleneck of the overall decoder. In this paper, a novel scheme is proposed for the LCC decoding to eliminate the factorization step and the key equation solver in the extra hard-decision decoder. Compared to prior LCC decoders, the proposed factorization-free LCC decoder can achieve the same throughput with 19% less area for a (255, 239) RS code with eta = 3.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118353.pdf","startPage":"2677","endPage":"2680","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5118353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Factorization-free Low-complexity Chase soft-decision decoding of Reed-Solomon codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Reed-Solomon codes","Interpolation","Variable speed drives","Testing","Equations","Throughput","Delay","Costs","Digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic codes","channel coding","computational complexity","decoding","interpolation","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["factorization-free low-complexity chase soft-decision decoding algorithm","Reed-Solomon code","polynomial complexity","algebraic soft-decision decoding algorithm","ASD algorithm","LCC algorithm","backward interpolation","re-encoding method","coordinate transformation","hard-decision decoder","LCC decoding","key equation solver","channel coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"Factorization-free Low-complexity Chase soft-decision decoding of Reed-Solomon codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5118353/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760469","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Factorization-free Low-complexity Chase soft-decision decoding of Reed-Solomon codes","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"684-1402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059792S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5118354,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Yuan","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Bo Yuan","id":"37574160600"},{"name":"Li Li","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Li Li","id":"37280704400"},{"name":"Jin Sha","affiliation":["Institute of VLSI Design, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Jin Sha","id":"37293859700"},{"name":"Zhongfeng Wang","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhongfeng Wang","id":"37279255300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5118354","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5118354","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reed-Solomon codes","Decoding","Computer architecture","Throughput","Hardware","Pipelines","Interleaved codes","Polynomials","Equations","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","interleaved codes","pipeline processing","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed communication system","Reed-Solomon decoder design","PI-iBM algorithm","pipeline interleaving","inversionless Berlekamp-Massey algorithm","bit rate 10 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"With the extensive applications in high-speed communication systems, the current high-throughput Reed-Solomon decoders are required to achieve the target data rates from 10 Gb/s to 100 Gb/s with low hardware complexity.

Simulation results are finally found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical analysis, showing a considerable improvement of the proposed strategy over other traditional solutions in terms of small-signal and large-signal performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5118365/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10760520","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A new advanced RNMC technique with dual-active current and voltage buffers for low-power high-load three-stage amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new advanced RNMC technique with dual-active current and voltage buffers for low-power high-load three-stage amplifiers","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"696-2131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048702S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5118377,"authors":[{"name":"Lieven De Lathauwer","affiliation":[" Science and Technology, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Kortrijk, Belgium"],"firstName":"Lieven","lastName":"De Lathauwer","id":"37294570700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5118377","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1025},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5118377","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Matrix decomposition","Matrices","Singular value decomposition","Data mining","Heart","Circuits and systems","Frequency","Signal processing","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["singular value decomposition","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix decomposition","signal theory","circuit theory","system theory","singular value decomposition","SVD","nonnegative matrix factorization","NMF","higher-order tensor","multiway array","nonnegative tensor factorization"]}],"abstract":"Matrix decompositions have always been at the heart of signal, circuit and system theory. In particular, the singular value decomposition (SVD) has been an important tool. There is currently a shift of paradigm in the algebraic foundations of these fields. Quite recently, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to outperform SVD at a number of tasks. Increasing research efforts are spent on the study and application of decompositions of higher-order tensors or multi-way arrays. This paper is a partial survey on tensor generalizations of the SVD and their applications.

Besides a high security level, candidate algorithms should show good performance on various platforms. While an average performance on high-end processors is generally not critical, implementability and flexibility in hardware is crucial, because the new standard will be implemented in a variety of lightweight devices. This paper investigates VLSI architectures of the SHA-3 candidates MD6 and irRUPT. The fastest circuit is the 16timesparallel MD6 core, reaching 16.3 Gbps at a complexity of 69.8 k gate equivalents (GE) on ASIC and 8.4 Gbps using 4465 Slices on FPGA. However, large memory requirements preclude the application of MD6 to resource-constrained systems.

Genetic algorithm (GA) is one of the typical EA. In traditional GA, the crossover is one-point crossover or two-point crossover. One-point crossover and two-point crossover change the genes of individuals too many in one time and they are not flexible, so it may lose some useful genes. In this paper, we propose the novel cell crossover. The cell crossover can change genes more flexibly and enhance more diversification to search spaces than one-point crossover and two-point crossover, so that we can find better solution. We propose optimal circuit design by using GA with cell crossover (GAcc), and with fitness function composed of circuit complexity, power and signal delay. Simulation results show GAcc is superior to traditional GA in point of the best elite fitness, the average value of fitness of correct circuits and the number of correct circuits. The best optimal circuit generated by GAcc is 27.9% better in evaluating value than that by GA with one-point crossover.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118429","startPage":"2982","endPage":"2985","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5118429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5117665","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5076158/5117665/05118429.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel Genetic Algorithm with cell crossover for circuit design optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5118429/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel Genetic Algorithm with cell crossover for circuit design optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5118429/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10760702","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2009","conferenceDate":"24-27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 May 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel Genetic Algorithm with cell crossover for circuit design optimization","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"760-1245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049637S","chronDate":"24-27 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5076158","isNumber":"5117665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5076158","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5117665","articleId":"5118429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5118437,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Chia Sun","affiliation":["Information Processing Laboratory, Dortmund University, Germany"],"firstName":"Chi-Chia","lastName":"Sun","id":"37577746400"},{"name":"Philipp Donner","affiliation":["Information Processing Laboratory, Dortmund University, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Donner","id":"37571481000"},{"name":"Jurgen Gotze","affiliation":["Information Processing Laboratory, Dortmund University, Germany"],"firstName":"Jurgen","lastName":"Gotze","id":"37569281800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3827-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3828-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0271-4302"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-1525"}],"articleNumber":"5118437","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete transforms","Discrete cosine transforms","Quantization","Reconfigurable architectures","Field programmable gate arrays","Video codecs","Video compression","Computational complexity","Sun","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","field programmable gate arrays","quantisation (signal)","system-on-chip","video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity multi-purpose IP core","quantized discrete cosine-integer transform","image-video transformations","reconfigurable architecture","FPGA synthesis","multiplierless video transformations","video CODEC","SoC designs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DCT","QDCT","integer transform","CORDIC","DCIT","QDCIT","low power","reconfigurable architecture","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a low-complexity and highly-integrated IP core for image/video transformations is presented.

For low power applications, trace-back approach (TBA) is usually employed for the survivor memory unit (SMU) of VD. However, TBA suffers from long latency and low throughput. Employing multiple memory banks can resolve the throughput issue on a great extent. In this paper, we present efficient schemes to improve the latency issue of conventional TBA by exploiting pre-trace-back method. In the meantime, we adopt buffer-based TBA method to reduce memory access times, thus reduce power assumption significantly.

When the input data dimension number is large, the reasoning of conventional fuzzy system often cannot correctly work because the degree of each rule become too small and sometimes they cause underflow. The network reasoning can correctly work by adding a compensated factor on membership function. The structure equivalent FRBF neural network was used in speech recognition system.
