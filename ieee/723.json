Unfortunately, power consumption of accelerometers used in conventional HAR is relatively high compared to the amount of power that can be harvested practically, which limits the usefulness of energy harvesting. Here, the authors present and evaluate a novel energy-harvesting wearable sensor architecture, HAR from Kinetic Energy (HARKE), that doesn't require using an accelerometer. Using off-the-shelf products, the authors demonstrate that the voltage of a kinetic harvester exhibits distinguishable patterns to distinctly infer human activities. Their results demonstrate that HARKE is as accurate as an accelerometer-based HAR system, yet consumes only a small fraction of the limited harvested energy.","doi":"10.1109/MIC.2015.115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4236/7230213/07230223.pdf","startPage":"8","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIC.2015.115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Harvesting Wearables for Activity-Aware Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230223","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230223/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Harvesting Wearables for Activity-Aware Services","volume":"19","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15415752","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230223/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Harvesting Wearables for Activity-Aware Services","sourcePdf":"mic2015050008.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052205S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4236","isNumber":"7230213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4236","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7230213","articleId":"7230223","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230234,"authors":[{"name":"Johan Borg","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Lule\u00e5 University of Technology, Lule\u00e5, Sweden"],"firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Borg","id":"37298257700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"7230234","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensitivity","Photonics","Junctions","Performance evaluation","CMOS process","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avalanche diodes","CMOS image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single-photon avalanche diodes","SPAD structures","image sensor CMOS process","performance variation","spatial sensitivity variation","nonfunctional devices","p+/n-well epitaxial SPAD junctions","deep-n-well epitaxial SPAD junctions","p-doped epitaxial SPAD junctions","dark count rate","size 0.18 mum","size 10 mum","efficiency 10 percent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Avalanche photodiodes","Photodiodes","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"kwd":["Avalanche photodiodes","photodiodes","CMOS integrated circuits"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we present the results from a series of single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) structures implemented in a commercial 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS process intended for CMOS image sensors.

Conventional energy-efficient power allocation in CoMP is based simply on water filling (WF) without considering frequency diversity (different base station clustering and user scheduling results in each subband). For the single-antenna scenario without the involvement of precoding, we have recently proposed a noncooperative power game (PG) mechanism with pricing for power allocation as an interference coordination method to improve energy efficiency and throughput performance. In this paper, we generalize the noncooperative pricing game mechanism with pricing across both frequency and space in the scenario of multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output-based CoMP transmissions. First, a block diagonalization precoding-based CoMP transmission system is reformulated as multiple single-antenna transmit-receive pairs from a viewpoint of streams. Second, taking frequency diversity into account, we propose a novel WF power-allocation algorithm to provide the power strategy space (the range of power of streams), based on which PG in each stream is further proposed. Thus, the noncooperative PG with pricing can be executed in all streams. Extensive simulation results then demonstrate the effectiveness of the new proposal.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230240","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency

To tackle the unknown nonlinear interaction functions in the large-scale system, the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is employed to approximate them. To further handle the unknown approximation errors and the effects of the unknown dead zone and external disturbances, integrated as the compounded disturbances, the corresponding disturbance observers are developed for their estimations. Based on the outputs of the RBFNN and the disturbance observer, the adaptive neural fault-tolerant control scheme is designed for uncertain nonlinear large-scale systems by using a decentralized backstepping technique. The closed-loop stability of the adaptive control system is rigorously proved via Lyapunov analysis and the satisfactory tracking performance is achieved under the integrated effects of unknown dead zone, actuator fault, and unknown external disturbances. Simulation results of a mass-spring-damper system are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive neural fault-tolerant control scheme for uncertain nonlinear large-scale systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230255/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","volume":"46","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16141485","pubMedId":"26340792","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7230255/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Large-Scale Systems With Unknown Dead Zone","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"SBK20130033"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61374130 and 61573184"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of China","grantNumber":"NCET-11-0830"},{"fundingName":"Six Talents Peak Project of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"2012-XXRJ-010"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Control of Uncertain Nonlinear Large-Scale Systems With Unknown Dead Zone","sourcePdf":"tcyb-chen-2456028-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125596S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7511816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"200","xplore-issue":"7511816","articleId":"7230255","onlineDate":"31 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7230257,"authors":[{"name":"Jasmin Smajic","affiliation":["University of Applied Sciences of Eastern Switzerland, Rapperswil, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jasmin","lastName":"Smajic","id":"37297133700"},{"name":"Christian Hafner","affiliation":["Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Hafner","id":"37328170900"},{"name":"Juerg Leuthold","affiliation":["Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Juerg","lastName":"Leuthold","id":"37085355064"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"7230257","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element analysis","Couplings","Magnetic cores","Magnetic domains","Magnetostatics","Mathematical model","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element method","discretization method","electromagnetic fields","boundary method","multiple multipole program","computational electromagnetics","coupled FEM-MMP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite element method","domain method","multiple multipole program","boundary method","nonlinear materials"]},{"kwd":["Boundary method","domain method","finite-element method (FEM)","multiple multipole program (MMP)","nonlinear materials"]}],"abstract":"The multiple multipole program (MMP) is a boundary method for computing electromagnetic fields, which is well established in high-frequency electromagnetics and computational optics due to its flexibility in terms of accuracy control, field excitation, and fast convergence.

In the big data era, we face a diversity of datasets from different sources in different domains. These datasets consist of multiple modalities, each of which has a different representation, distribution, scale, and density. How to unlock the power of knowledge from multiple disparate (but potentially connected) datasets is paramount in big data research, essentially distinguishing big data from traditional data mining tasks. This calls for advanced techniques that can fuse knowledge from various datasets organically in a machine learning and data mining task. This paper summarizes the data fusion methodologies, classifying them into three categories: stage-based, feature level-based, and semantic meaning-based data fusion methods. The last category of data fusion methods is further divided into four groups: multi-view learning-based, similarity-based, probabilistic dependency-based, and transfer learning-based methods. These methods focus on knowledge fusion rather than schema mapping and data merging, significantly distinguishing between cross-domain data fusion and traditional data fusion studied in the database community. This paper does not only introduce high-level principles of each category of methods, but also give examples in which these techniques are used to handle real big data problems. In addition, this paper positions existing works in a framework, exploring the relationship and difference between different data fusion methods. This paper will help a wide range of communities find a solution for data fusion in big data projects.","doi":"10.1109/TBDATA.2015.2465959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBDATA.2015.2465959","startPage":"16","endPage":"34","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Big Data","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687317/7152998/07230259.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7152998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Methodologies for Cross-Domain Data Fusion: An Overview","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Methodologies for Cross-Domain Data Fusion: An Overview","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15439886","publicationDate":"1 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7230259/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Methodologies for Cross-Domain Data Fusion: An Overview","sourcePdf":"tbdata-zheng-2465959-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163769S","chronDate":"March 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687317","isNumber":"7152998","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687317","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"7152998","articleId":"7230259","onlineDate":"31 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":7230264,"authors":[{"name":"Weihua Li","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7398213/7230264/weili-2475219-small.gif","p":["Weihua Li (M\u201912) received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2003.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.

To find discriminative features, a novel dimension reduction algorithm, referred to as the nearest and farthest distance preserving projection (NFDPP), is proposed for machine fault feature extraction and classification. With the NFDPP, both the nearest and farthest samples of the data manifold can be analyzed simultaneously to identify features leading to fault classification. Additionally, we denoise the features directly in the feature space to save computation time and storage space, and prove its equivalence to denoising the signals in the time domain. Through analysis of measured vibration data for bearings with different defects, it is demonstrated that the proposed NFDPP approach can effectively classify different bearing faults and identify the severity of the bearing ball defect, and the direct denoising of features yield a significant improvement in fault classification. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated in identifying compound faults in locomotive bearings in an industrial setting.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2475219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7398213/07230264.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2475219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature Denoising and Nearest\u2013Farthest Distance Preserving Projection for Machine Fault Diagnosis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230264","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Feature Denoising and Nearest\u2013Farthest Distance Preserving Projection for Machine Fault Diagnosis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230264/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15755392","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230264/","volume":"12","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51475170 and 51075150"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature Denoising and Nearest\u2013Farthest Distance Preserving Projection for Machine Fault Diagnosis","sourcePdf":"tii-li-2475219-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128143S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7398213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"7398213","articleId":"7230264","onlineDate":"31 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7230265,"authors":[{"name":"Minsoo Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/7284722/7230265/choi-2468575-small.gif","p":["Minsoo Choi (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea, in 2012, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include high-speed links, signal/power integrity, and interconnect modeling."]},"firstName":"Minsoo","lastName":"Choi","id":"37085373663"},{"name":"Kwangmin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/7284722/7230265/kkim-2468575-small.gif","p":["Kwangmin Kim (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea, in 2015, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree.","His current research interests include signal/power integrity and ReRAM modeling."]},"firstName":"Kwangmin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085626406"},{"name":"Jae-Yoon Sim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/7284722/7230265/sim-2468575-small.gif","p":["Jae-Yoon Sim (M\u201902\u2013SM\u201913) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronic and electrical engineering from the Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Korea, in 1993, 1995, and 1999, respectively.","He was a Senior Engineer with Samsung Electronics, Seoul, Korea, from 1999 to 2005.

The formulas' accuracies and computation time improvements are verified by comparison with the SPICE simulation and the measurement results. According to our formulas, the loss is roughly a linear function of the product of the length and the square root of the frequency in RC-dominant interconnects. In LC-dominant interconnects, the channel loss due to skin effect is roughly proportional to the product of the length and the square root of the frequency, while the channel loss due to dielectric loss is approximately proportional to the product of the length and the frequency. From the channel loss of our formulas, an equalized eye size can be easily estimated. Therefore, designers can use our tradeoff formulas easily and quickly to estimate link-level tradeoff among the equalized eye size, the data rate, and the channel length in designing an equalized link through RC- and LC-dominant single-ended interconnects.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2468575","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503870/7284722/07230265.pdf","startPage":"1497","endPage":"1506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7284722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2015.2468575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Formulas for Tradeoff Among Channel Loss, Length, and Frequency of -- and --Dominant Single-Ended Interconnects for Fast Equalized Link Tradeoff Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Formulas for Tradeoff Among Channel Loss, Length, and Frequency of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$RC$ </tex-math></inline-formula>- and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$LC$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Dominant Single-Ended Interconnects for Fast Equalized Link Tradeoff Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230265/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15489361","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230265/","volume":"5","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea through the Korea Government within the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","grantNumber":"2014K2A1A2048513 and 2015R1A2A2A09001553"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Formulas for Tradeoff Among Channel Loss, Length, and Frequency of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$RC$ </tex-math></inline-formula>- and <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$LC$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-Dominant Single-Ended Interconnects for Fast Equalized Link Tradeoff Estimation","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-choi-2468575-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066747S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"7284722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7284722","articleId":"7230265","onlineDate":"31 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7230271,"authors":[{"name":"Meysam Golipour","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7386543/7230271/golip-2466657-small.gif","p":["\n\nMeysam Golipour received the B.S.E.E. degree from Shahid Beheshti \nUniversity, Tehran, Iran, in 2012 and the M.S.E.E. degree from Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, in 2014.","His research interests include remote sensing, pattern recognition, and signal and image processing."]},"firstName":"Meysam","lastName":"Golipour","id":"37085748400"},{"name":"Hassan Ghassemian","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7386543/7230271/ghass-2466657-small.gif","p":["\n\nHassan Ghassemian (M'99\u2013SM'06) received the B.S.E.E. degree from \nTehran College of Telecommunication, Tehran, Iran, in 1980 and the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Purdue University, \nWest Lafayette, IN, USA, in 1984 and 1988, respectively.","Since 1988, he has been with the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, \nwhere he is currently a Professor of electrical and computer engineering.

The proposed method is based on integrating hierarchical segmentation results into Markov random field (MRF) spatial prior in the Bayesian framework. This work includes two main contributions. First, statistical region merging (SRM) segmentation algorithm is extended to a hierarchical version, HSRM. Second, a method for extracting a multilevel \u201cfuzzy no-border/border\u201d map from HSRM segmentation hierarchy is proposed, which are then exploited as weighting coefficients to modify the spatial prior of MRF-based multilevel logistic (MLL) model. The proposed method, named as MRF + HSRM, addresses the common problem of MRF-based methods, i.e., over-smoothing of classification result. Several experiments are conducted using real HS images to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in comparison with conventional MRF, and some state-of-the-art weighted MRF and object-based classifiers. To estimate the class conditional probability distribution in Bayesian framework, probabilistic support vector machine (SVM) and subspace multinomial logistic regression (MLRsub) classifiers are used. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate more homogeneous regions similar to MRF-based methods, while preserving class boundaries as accurately as segmentation-based methods. The overhead computational burden of the proposed hierarchical segmentation stage is negligible considering the improvement it offers in classification results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7386543/07230271.pdf","startPage":"805","endPage":"816","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2466657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2466657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7386543","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrating Hierarchical Segmentation Maps With MRF Prior for Classification of Hyperspectral Images in a Bayesian Framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Merging","Support vector machines","Bayes methods","Probabilistic logic","Adaptation models","Logistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","hyperspectral imaging","image classification","image segmentation","Markov processes","remote sensing","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical segmentation map","MRF prior","hyperspectral image classification","bayesian framework","spectral-spatial classification method","Markov random field","statistical region merging segmentation algorithm","multilevel fuzzy no-border-border map","HSRM segmentation hierarchy","MRF-based multilevel logistic model","MRF-based method","object-based classifier","probability distribution","probabilistic SVM","support vector machine","subspace multinomial logistic regression classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification","hierarchical segmentation","hyperspectral (HS) image","Markov random field (MRF)","multilevel logistic (MLL)","statistical region merging (SRM)","subspace multinomial logistic regression (MLRsub)","support vector machine (SVM)"]},{"kwd":["Classification","hierarchical segmentation","hyperspectral (HS) image","Markov random field (MRF)","multilevel logistic (MLL)","statistical region merging (SRM)","subspace multinomial logistic regression (MLRsub)","support vector machine (SVM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Hierarchical Segmentation Maps With MRF Prior for Classification of Hyperspectral Images in a Bayesian Framework","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7230271/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15720423","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Hierarchical Segmentation Maps With MRF Prior for Classification of Hyperspectral Images in a Bayesian Framework","sourcePdf":"tgrs-ghassemian-2466657-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116974S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7386543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7386543","articleId":"7230271","onlineDate":"31 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7230279,"authors":[{"name":"Debiao He","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering, Computer School, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China","Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Network Security and Cryptology, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7277179/7230279/he-2473820-small.gif","p":["Debiao He received the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2009.

To guarantee secure communication in VANETs, security and privacy issues must be addressed before their deployment. The conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA) scheme is suitable for solving security and privacy-preserving problems in VANETs, because it supports both mutual authentication and privacy protection simultaneously. Many identity-based CPPA schemes for VANETs using bilinear pairings have been proposed over the last few years to enhance security or to improve performance. However, it is well known that the bilinear pairing operation is one of the most complex operations in modern cryptography. To achieve better performance and reduce computational complexity of information processing in VANET, the design of a CPPA scheme for the VANET environment that does not use bilinear paring becomes a challenge. To address this challenge, we propose a CPPA scheme for VANETs that does not use bilinear paring and we demonstrate that it could supports both the mutual authentication and the privacy protection simultaneously. Our proposed CPPA scheme retains most of the benefits obtained with the previously proposed CPPA schemes. Moreover, the proposed CPPA scheme yields a better performance in terms of computation cost and communication cost making it be suitable for use by the VANET safety-related applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230279/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"10","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15484839","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7230279/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Identity-Based Conditional Privacy-Preserving Authentication Scheme for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61373169, 61572379 and 61501333"},{"fundingName":"National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2015AA016004"},{"fundingName":"Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Network Security and Cryptology Research Fund through Fujian Normal University","grantNumber":"15011"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province of China","grantNumber":"2015CFB257"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"91418202 and 61472178"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2014CB340702"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472083 and U1405255"},{"fundingName":"Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation","grantNumber":"141065"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Fujian University","grantNumber":"JA14067"},{"fundingName":"Distinguished Young Scholars Fund, Fujian Province, China"},{"fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Cryptology Research Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Identity-Based Conditional Privacy-Preserving Authentication Scheme for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tifs-huang-2473820-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109439S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7277179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"350","xplore-issue":"7277179","articleId":"7230279","onlineDate":"31 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7230282,"authors":[{"name":"Kang An","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7230282/an-2474865_print-small.gif","p":["\nKang An received the B.S. degree from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2011 and the M.S. degree from the PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2014, all in electronic engineering.

This paper investigates the performance of an amplify-and-forward (AF) hybrid satellite-terrestrial relay network (HSTRN), where the links of the two hops undergo Shadowed-Rician and Rayleigh fading distributions, respectively. By assuming that a single antenna relay is used to assist the signal transmission between the multi-antenna satellite and multi-antenna mobile terminal, and multiple interferers corrupt both the relay and destination, we first obtain the equivalent end-to-end signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the system. Then, an approximate yet very accurate closed-form expression for the ergodic capacity of the HSTRN is derived. The analytical lower bound expressions are also obtained to efficiently evaluate the outage probability (OP) and average symbol error rate (ASER) of the system. Furthermore, the asymptotic OP and ASER expressions are developed at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reveal the achievable diversity order and array gain of the considered HSTRN. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate of the analytical results, and show the impact of various parameters on the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2474865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2474865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07230282.pdf","startPage":"4390","endPage":"4404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Multi-Antenna Hybrid Satellite-Terrestrial Relay Networks in the Presence of Interference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Multi-Antenna Hybrid Satellite-Terrestrial Relay Networks in the Presence of Interference","volume":"63","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230282/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676760","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230282/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271255, 61471392, 61571115 and 61501507"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20131068"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory in Southeast University","grantNumber":"2012D15"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Multi-Antenna Hybrid Satellite-Terrestrial Relay Networks in the Presence of Interference","sourcePdf":"tcomm-lin-2474865-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107888S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7230282","onlineDate":"31 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7230284,"authors":[{"name":"Maoguo Gong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding, International Research Center for Intelligent Perception and Computation, Ministry of Education, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7330076/7230284/gong-2469673-small.gif","p":["Maoguo Gong (M\u201907\u2013SM\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic science and technology from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2003 and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Teacher with Xidian University.

This cyclic-motion performance index is then integrated into a quadratic programming (QP)-type scheme with time-varying constraints, called the time-varying-constrained DACMG (TVC-DACMG) scheme. The scheme includes the kinematic motion equations of two arms and the time-varying joint limits. The scheme can not only generate the cyclic motion of two arms for a humanoid robot but also control the arms to move to the desired position. In addition, the scheme considers the physical limit avoidance. To solve the QP problem, a recurrent neural network is presented and used to obtain the optimal solutions. Computer simulations and physical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and the accuracy of such a TVC-DACMG scheme and the neural network solver.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2469147","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning

Control of Neural Networks With State-Dependent Coefficient Matrices","abstract":"This brief is concerned with synchronization control of a class of neural networks with state-dependent coefficient matrices. Being different from the existing drive-response neural networks in the literature, a novel model of drive-response neural networks is established. The concepts of uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) synchronization and convex hull Lyapunov function are introduced. Then, by using the convex hull Lyapunov function approach, the UUB synchronization design of the drive-response neural networks is proposed, and a delay-independent control law guaranteeing the bounded synchronization of the neural networks is constructed. All present conditions are formulated in terms of bilinear matrix inequalities. By comparison, it is shown that the neural networks obtained in this brief are less conservative than those ones in the literature, and the bounded synchronization is suitable for the novel drive-response neural networks. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the validity of the obtained results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230288/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16397044","pubMedId":"26340786","volume":"27","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7230288/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Synchronization Control of Neural Networks With State-Dependent Coefficient Matrices","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503107, 61203123 and 61403267"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB821200"},{"fundingName":"Liaoning Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"LR2014035"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization Control of Neural Networks With State-Dependent Coefficient Matrices","sourcePdf":"tnnls-zhang-2465136-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11165S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7605560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7605560","articleId":"7230288","onlineDate":"31 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7230289,"authors":[{"name":"Deliang Fan","affiliation":["Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/7322313/7230289/fan-2471092-small.gif","p":["Deliang Fan received the B.S. degree in electronic Information\n engineering from Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2010.

A cluster of SHE-STOs can be locked to a common frequency and phase with an injected ac current signal. DC input to each STO from external stimuli can conditionally unlock some of them. Based on the input dc signal, the degree of synchronization of SHE-STO cluster is detected by CMOS interface circuitry. The degree of synchronization can be used for associative computing/matching. We present a numerical simulation model of SHE-STO devices based on Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with spin-transfer torque term and Spin Hall Effect. The model is then used to analyze the frequency and phase locking properties of injection-locked SHE-STO cluster. Results show that associative computing based on the injection locked SHE-STO cluster can be energy efficient and relatively immune to device parameter variations and thermal noise.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2015.2471092","startPage":"1083","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/7322313/07230289.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2015.2471092","endPage":"1093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Injection-Locked Spin Hall-Induced Coupled-Oscillators for Energy Efficient Associative Computing","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7729/7322313/7230289-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230289/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Injection-Locked Spin Hall-Induced Coupled-Oscillators for Energy Efficient Associative Computing","volume":"14","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7230289/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15587679","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"DARPA UPSIDE program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"},{"fundingName":"Center for Spintronics: Materials, Interfaces, and Architecture (CSPIN)"},{"fundingName":"StartNet Center"},{"fundingName":"DoD and SRC"},{"fundingName":"NSSEFF Fellows program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Injection-Locked Spin Hall-Induced Coupled-Oscillators for Energy Efficient Associative Computing","sourcePdf":"tnano-fan-2471092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123772S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"7322313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7322313","articleId":"7230289","onlineDate":"31 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7230290,"authors":[{"name":"Yunmin Kim","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7230290/kim-2475165-small.gif","p":["\n\nYunmin Kim received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Sungkyunkwan \nUniversity, Suwon, Korea, in 2012 and 2014, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree, all in \nelectrical and computer engineering.","His research interests include energy-harvesting networks, cognitive radio networks, vehicular networks, wireless \nlocal area networks, radio-frequency identification/near-field communication, Internet of things, and resource \nallocation and medium access control of wireless communication networks."]},"firstName":"Yunmin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085861097"},{"name":"Mingyu Lee","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7230290/mlee-2475165-small.gif","p":["\n\nMingyu Lee received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from \nKwangwoon University, Seoul, Korea, in 2009 and the M.S. degree in mobile systems engineering from Sungkyunkwan \nUniversity, Suwon, Korea, in 2012, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in IT convergence.","His research interests include cognitive radio networks, wireless local area networks, ad hoc networks, vehicular \nnetworks, energy-harvesting, machine-to-machine communications, and Internet of things."]},"firstName":"Mingyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37715640800"},{"name":"Tae-Jin Lee","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7230290/tlee-2475165-small.gif","p":["\n\nTae-Jin Lee (M'99) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics \nengineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1989 and 1991, respectively; the M.S.E. degree in electrical \nengineering and computer science from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, in 1995; and the Ph.D. degree in \nelectrical and computer engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA, in 1999.","In 1999, he joined the Corporate R&D Center, Samsung Electronics, where he was a Senior Engineer.

Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE) is designed for VANETs to provide services efficiently. Since the control messages transmitted in WAVE are broadcast, the probability of collision increases by increasing the number of vehicle nodes. In this paper, we propose a coordinated multichannel medium access control (C-MAC) protocol for VANETs. The proposed C-MAC protocol provides contention-free broadcasting for safety messages by the coordination of roadside units (RSUs). An RSU schedules the broadcasting order of transmissions for safety messages. Contention-free broadcasting lowers the probability of collision and reduces the required time for transmissions of safety messages. An RSU may play the role of harvesting energy wirelessly to coordinated VANET terminals, which are gateways for Internet-of-things devices in the car. The contention interval for service channels is optimized to provide maximum throughput. The proposed C-MAC protocol is shown to enhance throughput and delay via analysis and simulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Multichannel MAC Protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2475165","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07230290.pdf","startPage":"6508","endPage":"6517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2475165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230290/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Multichannel MAC Protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7230290/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210014","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Korean government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"(2014R1A5A1011478)."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Multichannel MAC Protocol for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-lee-2475165-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085879S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7230290","onlineDate":"31 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7230292,"authors":[{"name":"Weixing Lin","affiliation":["University of Aberdeen, School of Engineering, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/7475922/7230292/7230292-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weixing Lin (S'11\u2013M'13) received the B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 2008 and 2014, respectively.","Currently, he is a Research Fellow with the University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, U.K. His research interest is different topologies of MMC, simulations on EMPT-RV, dc grids, high power dc-dc converters, and high-power dc\u2013dc autotransformers."]},"firstName":"Weixing","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085353925"},{"name":"Dragan Jovcic","affiliation":["University of Aberdeen, School of Engineering, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/7475922/7230292/7230292-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Dragan Jovcic (S'97\u2013M'00\u2013SM'06) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand, in 1999.","Currently, he is a Professor with the University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, U.K., where he has been since 2004.

Indeed, the reconfigurable properties of RAs can be used as additional degrees of freedom to enhance the performance of SSK in terms of throughput, system complexity, and error performance. In this context, considering correlated and nonidentically distributed Rician fading channels, we propose a number of SSK-RA schemes using SSK with antenna-state selection while taking advantage of the effect of RAs on the multipath propagation channel. More specifically, based on the variation of the Rician K-factor and the correlation coefficients with different antenna states, the proposed schemes jointly optimize the fading and correlation parameters to enhance SSK's performance. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the proposed SSK-RA schemes over Rician fading channels in terms of average spectral efficiency (ASE) and bit error rate (BER). We also provide several simulation examples through which we corroborate these analytical results. The proposed schemes are shown to enhance the performance of SSK both in terms of ASE and BER. For the same ASE, compared to that of SSK, not only do the proposed SSK-RA schemes provide much better error performance, they also reduce the implementation cost and the overall system complexity considerably.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07230296.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2474862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2474862","startPage":"446","endPage":"457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Antenna-Based Space-Shift Keying (SSK) for MIMO Rician Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230296/","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Antenna-Based Space-Shift Keying (SSK) for MIMO Rician Channels","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230296/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"15697393","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation)","grantNumber":"NPRP 5-250-2-087 and NPRP 09-126-2-054"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Antenna-Based Space-Shift Keying (SSK) for MIMO Rician Channels","sourcePdf":"twc-bouida-2474862-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132059S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7230296","onlineDate":"31 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230300,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijun Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Autonomous System and Network Control, College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7469897/7230300/li-2465352-small.gif","p":["Zhijun Li (M\u201907\u2013SM\u201909) received the Dr.Eng. degree in mechatronics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2002.","From 2003 to 2005, he was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent Systems, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan.

By using the derived tracking-error kinematics of nonholonomic robots, the proposed MPC approach is iteratively transformed as a constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem, and then a primal-dual neural network is used to solve this QP problem over a finite receding horizon. The applied neural-dynamic optimization can make the cost function of MPC converge to the exact optimal values of the formulated constrained QP.

In particular, the power splitting (PS) technique is leveraged at each receiver to divide the received signal into two flows, for information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH), respectively. As a whole system, our objective is to minimize the total transmit power of all transmitters by jointly designing transmit beamformers, power splitters, and receive filters, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for ID and the harvested power constraint for EH at each receiver. Due to the coupling nature of all variables, the formulated joint transceiver design problem is nonconvex, and has not yet been well addressed in the literature. In this paper, we first propose a semidefinite relaxation-based alternating optimization (SDRAO) solution to approach the optimal solution of the problem. Then, we semidecouple the joint optimization by the derived diversity interference alignment (DIA) technique, and obtain a solution of lower complexity. Finally, a closed-form solution is further developed relying on the transmitter-side zero-forcing (TZF), which can be implemented in a distributed manner, with the lowest computational complexity and CSI exchanging overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230306/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","volume":"15","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15697446","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7230306/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Transceiver Design for SWIPT in <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$</tex-math></inline-formula>-User MIMO Interference Channels","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61501124 and 61201224"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China (NSTMP)","grantNumber":"2015ZX03001040"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT14QY44"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Transceiver Design for SWIPT in <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$K$</tex-math></inline-formula>-User MIMO Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"twc-zong-2474857-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141241S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7230306","onlineDate":"31 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7230332,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Moghadas","affiliation":["Multimedia Processing Laboratory, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9754/7230329/7230332/mogha-2431220-small.gif","p":["Maryam Moghadas received the B.S. degree in computer hardware engineering from the Ferdowsi University of Mashad, Mashad, Iran, in 2004, and the M.S. degree in computer architecture engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2007.

However, processing power is still behind the required resources for some multimedia applications such as new video coding standards. Mobile cloud computing is a solution for this concern. In order to efficiently distribute tasks onto an infrastructure of devices, a mapping algorithm is required. This algorithm should determine the suitable device in the cloud and should also allocate the corresponding core in the selected multicore device. Providing a suitable algorithm considering the two domains of cloud and Multiprocessor System on Chip (MPSoC) simultaneously is a challenge. Describing the mapping algorithms with a set of descriptive elements makes differentiation among them easier. Unification of these features on both domains results in simpler mapping algorithms. In this paper, we present a generic representation for the mapping algorithms in the MPSoC and cloud environments. Grounded Theory has been applied to identify the main features of the mapping algorithms. The obtained features are organized in more abstract categories based on their similarities. In order to evaluate the results, a few sample mapping algorithms from each of the cloud and MPSoC domains have been successfully characterized with the obtained features.","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2015.2431220","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9754/7230329/07230332.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2015.2431220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230329","startPage":"204","endPage":"218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward a Unified Characterization of Mapping Algorithms in Cloud and MPSoC Environments Using a Literature-Based Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Toward a Unified Characterization of Mapping Algorithms in Cloud and MPSoC Environments Using a Literature-Based Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230332/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"38","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Summer 2015","accessionNumber":"15415940","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7230332/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward a Unified Characterization of Mapping Algorithms in Cloud and MPSoC Environments Using a Literature-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"cjece-moghadas-2431220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122913S","chronDate":"Summer  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"7230329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7230329","articleId":"7230332","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7230351,"authors":[{"name":"Yongbin You","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yongbin","lastName":"You","id":"37085620996"},{"name":"Yanmin Qian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yanmin","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085386346"},{"name":"Kai Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Yu","id":"38580940700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1948-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1947-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230351","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local trajectory based speech enhancement for robust speech recognition with deep neural network","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7177532/7230339/07230351.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230339","doi":"10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230351","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech","Context","Trajectory","Speech recognition","Acoustics","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","neural nets","regression analysis","speech enhancement","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local trajectory","speech enhancement","automatic speech recognition","ASR","deep neural network","DNN","nonlinear feature transformation","log-linear classifier","regression model","feature enhancement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["noise robustness","deep neural network","feature enhancement","dynamic feature"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230351","abstract":"Deep neural network(DNN) has achieved a great success in automatic speech recognition(ASR), and it can be regarded as a joint model combining the nonlinear feature transformation and the log-linear classifier.

However, triphone states are unevenly distributed. In this situation, the training algorithm tends to converge to a local optimum more related to states with rich data than states with poor data. Thus, the imbalance of the training data decreases the ASR performances, especially for under-resourced languages. To deal with this issue, we explore a resampling technique, called \u201cprobabilistic sampling\u201d, which can be seen as a linear smoothing between the original sampling and the uniform sampling. The effectiveness of the probabilistic sampling has been studied in two under-resourced ASR experiments. With the probabilistic sampling, the first experiment got a 6.3% relative phone error rate (PER) reduction compared to the conventional DNN baseline; the second experiment used shared-hidden-layer multilingual DNN as the baseline, and obtained a 4.9% relative PER reduction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving HMM/DNN in ASR of under-resourced languages using probabilistic sampling","doi":"10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230354","startPage":"20","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230339","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7177532/7230339/07230354.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230354","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230354/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improving HMM/DNN in ASR of under-resourced languages using probabilistic sampling","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230354/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417480","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving HMM/DNN in ASR of under-resourced languages using probabilistic sampling","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0000020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069705S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230356,"authors":[{"name":"Yongbin You","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yongbin","lastName":"You","id":"37085620996"},{"name":"Yanmin Qian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yanmin","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085386346"},{"name":"Tianxing He","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tianxing","lastName":"He","id":"37085422455"},{"name":"Kai Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Yu","id":"38580940700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1948-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1947-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230356","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Topology","Robustness","Speech recognition","Acoustics","Training","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian processes","hidden Markov models","neural nets","signal denoising","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DNN-derived bottleneck features","GMM-HMM based robust speech recognition","deep neural network","Gaussian mixture model","hidden Markov model","Aurora 4 task","noise compensation","word error rate reduction","WER reduction","node-pruned DNN structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["deep neural network","bottleneck feature","node-pruning","robust speech recognition"]}],"abstract":"In recent years, deep neural network(DNN) has achieved great success when used as acoustic model in speech recognition.

Simulations results are provided to verify the low PAR waveform design capability corresponding to arbitrary beampatterns.","doi":"10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230373","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7177532/7230339/07230373.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"117","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of wideband MIMO radar waveforms with low peak-to-average ratio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230373/","displayDocTitle":"Design of wideband MIMO radar waveforms with low peak-to-average ratio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417592","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230373/","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of wideband MIMO radar waveforms with low peak-to-average ratio","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0000113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054838S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7230380,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Rui","affiliation":["College of Field Engineering, PLA Univ. of Sci. & Tech., Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Rui","id":"37295489700"},{"name":"Jian-chao Fei","affiliation":["College of Field Engineering, PLA Univ. of Sci. & Tech., Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jian-chao","lastName":"Fei","id":"37085639699"},{"name":"Peng Cui","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Cui","id":"37398799300"},{"name":"You Zhou","affiliation":["Jiangsu Institute of Commerce, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"You","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085649122"},{"name":"Hu-sheng Fang","affiliation":["College of Field Engineering, PLA Univ. of Sci. & Tech., Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hu-sheng","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085647382"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1948-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1947-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230380","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230380","abstract":"Human head detection is an important means of pedestrian detection and counting. By now, head detection is mainly based on outline, color and template which have low recognition rate and error tolerance. Recently, deep learning has become a research hotspot in the field of pattern recognition. As a model of deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) performs well in the areas of image recognition and speech analysis. In this paper, a new method based on CNN was proposed. This method uses a few new twists, such as multi-stage weighted feature and connections that skip layers to integrate global shape information and local motif information.

In this paper, we address the CS recovery of dynamic MRI from partially sampled k-t space using the nonlocal low-rank regularization (NLR). To exploit the nonlocal redundancy in the spatial-temporal dimension, the dynamic MRI sequence is divided into overlapping 3D patches along both the spatial and temporal directions. We exploit the fact that the matrix that consists of a sufficient number of similar patches is low-rank. To effectively approximate the low-rank matrix, the non-convex surrogate function logdet (\u00b7) is used instead of the convex nuclear norm.

Since the signals received at different sensors occupy the same time-frequency regions and share a common nonzero support, the recovery of TFSRs can be cast as a group sparse reconstruction problem. The reconstructed auto- and cross-sensor TFSRs enable the formation of the spatial time-frequency distribution (STFD) matrix, which is used, in turn, to propose the sparse time-frequency MUSIC (STF-MUSIC).

PU is equipped with single antenna while SU is equipped with multiple antennas. The key different from the conventional spectrum sensing studies is that we assume PU could work on different transmit power levels to cope with different communication environments, which is a more practice-matching model. We also suppose that there is some cooperative mechanism between PU and SU so that SU could know PU's training symbols during sensing. In the propose scheme, SU needs not only to detect the presence of PU but also to identify PU's transmit power levels after it is \u201cdetected\u201d. Hence, the whole problem is much more challenging than that in conventional CR. We design the matched filter spectrum sensing algorithm by assuming that the channel information is only partially known.

The FDA uses a small frequency increment based on phased-array to provide a range-dependent beampattern, which thus offers a beamforming-based solution to suppress range-dependent interferences.

Traditionally CNN is trained by supervised learning method with labeled data and used as a classifier by adding a classification layer in the end. Its capability of extracting image features is largely limited due to the difficulty of setting up a large training dataset. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised learning CNN model, which uses a so-called convolutional sparse auto-encoder (CSAE) algorithm pre-train the CNN. Instead of using labeled natural images for CNN training, the CSAE algorithm can be used to train the CNN with unlabeled artificial images, which enables easy expansion of training data and unsupervised learning. The CSAE algorithm is especially designed for extracting complex features from specific objects such as Chinese characters. After the features of articficial images are extracted by the CSAE algorithm, the learned parameters are used to initialize the first CNN convolutional layer, and then the CNN model is fine-trained by scene image patches with a linear classifier. The new CNN model is applied to Chinese scene text detection and is evaluated with a multilingual image dataset, which labels Chinese, English and numerals texts separately. More than 10% detection precision gain is observed over two CNN models.","doi":"10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230438","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7177532/7230339/07230438.pdf","startPage":"428","endPage":"432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new unsupervised convolutional neural network model for Chinese scene text detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230438/","displayDocTitle":"A new unsupervised convolutional neural network model for Chinese scene text detection","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230438/","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417444","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new unsupervised convolutional neural network model for Chinese scene text detection","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0000428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086002S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230441,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Li","id":"38516581700"},{"name":"Dongning Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Dongning","lastName":"Guo","id":"37272631900"},{"name":"Huarui Yin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Huarui","lastName":"Yin","id":"37276764000"},{"name":"Guo Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China"],"firstName":"Guo","lastName":"Wei","id":"37281335000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1948-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1947-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230441","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230441","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Delays","Safety","Protocols","Wireless communication","Uplink","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","broadband networks","disasters","modulation coding","open systems","sensor placement","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airdropped sensor","nationwide interoperable public safety wireless broadband network","first responder network authority","FirstNet","United States government","optimal ALOHA protocol","rescue delay","modulation and coding rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Public Safety Wireless Broadband Network","airdropped sensor","stochastic geometry"]}],"abstract":"A nationwide interoperable public safety wireless broadband network is being planned by the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) under the auspices of the United States government.

This paper proposes a network with airdropped sensors to provide network coverage over disaster areas where it is difficult for human beings to regularly deploy sensors. The rescue delay for the victims to announce their existence to or receive the notification from the sensors is discussed. Then the optimal ALOHA protocol and the minimum number of sensors are derived subject to the rescue delay requirement. The simulations compare the performance of different transmission modes specified by the modulation and coding rate. It is shown that the transmission mode should be carefully selected to balance the tradeoff between the lifetime and the cost of the public safety network.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230441","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7177532/7230339/07230441.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"447","doi":"10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230441","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The public safety wireless broadband network with airdropped sensors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"The public safety wireless broadband network with airdropped sensors","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7230441/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417506","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230441/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The public safety wireless broadband network with airdropped sensors","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0000443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087386S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":7230444,"authors":[{"name":"Yunjuan Zang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yunjuan","lastName":"Zang","id":"37085710231"},{"name":"Feixiang Ni","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Feixiang","lastName":"Ni","id":"37085710641"},{"name":"Zhiyong Feng","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Feng","id":"37536937000"},{"name":"Shuguang Cui","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China","Dept. of ECE, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Shuguang","lastName":"Cui","id":"37267838900"},{"name":"Zhi Ding","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China","Dept. of ECE, UC Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Ding","id":"37278651400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1948-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1947-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230444","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":666},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Base stations","Neural networks","Time series analysis","Predictive models","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pattern clustering","telecommunication computing","telecommunication network management","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform processing","cellular traffic prediction","machine learning networks","network traffic volume prediction","resource management","dynamic network control","wavelet decomposition methods","Elman-NN","Elman neural network","K-means clustering","cellular operators","cell-station traffic volume prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Elman neural network","traffic flow prediction","wavelet decomposition"]}],"abstract":"The ability for cellular operators to closely predict the network traffic volume at various locations can be very important for their resource management and dynamic network control including offloading.

However, we illustrate that asymptotically perfect CSI does not guarantee that the capacity achievable at infinite SNR is the same as the capacity achievable in the perfect CSI case.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7177532/7230339/07230470.pdf","startPage":"582","endPage":"585","doi":"10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolution of capacity lower bound of interference alignment with least-square channel estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Evolution of capacity lower bound of interference alignment with least-square channel estimation","htmlLink":"/document/7230470/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15417483","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolution of capacity lower bound of interference alignment with least-square channel estimation","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0000582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061215S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7230471,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Chang","affiliation":["State Radio Monitoring Center, Beijing, China PR"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085637797"},{"name":"Geoffrey Ye Li","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA"],"firstName":"Geoffrey Ye","lastName":"Li","id":"38516728900"},{"name":"Jingchun Li","affiliation":["State Radio Monitoring Center, Beijing, China PR"],"firstName":"Jingchun","lastName":"Li","id":"37858007700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1948-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1947-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230471","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Channel estimation","Modulation","Frequency estimation","Silicon","Nickel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["estimation theory","higher order statistics","modulation","radiocommunication","signal sampling","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal-to-noise ratio","SNR estimation","oversampling","SIMO communications","linear modulation","modulation types","transmitted symbols","second-order statistics","fourth-order statistics","SNR estimators","M4 estimator","synchronization uncertainty","noncooperative communications networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SNR","estimation","SIMO","modulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230471","abstract":"It is required to accurately estimate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) without the a priori knowledge of modulation types and transmitted symbols in certain areas of communications.

Unlike the one shot trading designs in previous studies, in this paper, we introduce a financing contract that allows the SU to pay only part of the total amount when the contract is signed, known as the down payment. Then, after the spectrum is released, the SU pays the rest of the money, known as the installment payment, from the revenue generated by utilizing the spectrum. As the PU may not have the full acknowledgement of the SU's capability in generating revenue, nor the amount of effort the SU exerts, the problems of adverse selection and moral hazard arise in the two scenarios, respectively. In particular, we consider three situations when either or both adverse selection and moral hazard are present during the trading. We find the optimal solutions in all three scenarios. Through simulations, we show that the adverse selection only and moral hazard only cases serve as the lower and upper bounds of the general case where both problems are present.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230339","startPage":"601","endPage":"605","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7177532/7230339/07230474.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Financing contract with adverse selection and moral hazard for spectrum trading in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7230474/","displayDocTitle":"Financing contract with adverse selection and moral hazard for spectrum trading in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417438","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Financing contract with adverse selection and moral hazard for spectrum trading in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0000601.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053791S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230492,"authors":[{"name":"Tian Gao","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.

In real tasks, the background noises are often mixed with some human voice interferences. In this paper, we explore a framework to unify speech enhancement and speech separation for a speaker-dependent scenario based on deep neural networks (DNNs). Using a supervised method, DNN is adopted to directly model a nonlinear mapping function between noisy and clean speech signals. The signals of speaker interferers are considered as one type of universal noise signals in our framework. In order to be able to handle a wide range of additive noise in the real-world situations, a large training set that encompasses many possible combinations of speech and noise types, is designed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can get the comparable performances to those single speech enhancement or separation systems. Furthermore, the resulting DNN model, trained with artificial synthesized data, is also effective in dealing with noisy speech data recorded in real-world conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230492","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7177532/7230339/07230492.pdf","startPage":"687","endPage":"691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified speaker-dependent speech separation and enhancement system based on deep neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230492/","displayDocTitle":"A unified speaker-dependent speech separation and enhancement system based on deep neural networks","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230492/","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417452","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified speaker-dependent speech separation and enhancement system based on deep neural networks","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0000687.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070316S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230497,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Cagatay Cirik","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Ali Cagatay","lastName":"Cirik","id":"37085390989"},{"name":"Kari Rikkinen","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Kari","lastName":"Rikkinen","id":"37085443263"},{"name":"Rui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, P.

Simulation results are included to illustrate the superiority of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230504/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15417584","publicationDate":"July 2015","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230504/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A novel worst-case robust beamformer based on interference-plus-noise covariance reconstruction and uncertainty level estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel worst-case robust beamformer based on interference-plus-noise covariance reconstruction and uncertainty level estimation","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0000746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080511S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230505,"authors":[{"name":"F.

In this paper, the Bayesian filtering framework is utilized to unveil the error propagation of time-variant channel tracking of MIMO systems. Firstly, the tracking error phenomenon is presented to unveil the influences of uncertainties in dependent factors, e.g., the latest tracking error, measurement error and channel transition uncertainties. Secondly, it is shown that the channel tracking error propagation philosophy is similar to the Ohm's law in circuit theory, which provides intuitive insights into the dominating factors of the time varying channel tracking. Finally, the balance state of channel tracking error propagation is presented to highlight that, the channel tracking precision will gradually converge to a stable value, which depends on the SNR, the channel transition matrix and its transition variance.

Specifically, 1/3 of the preamble symbols are used as the pilots for channel estimation, the other 1/3 of the preamble symbols are used as the additional data symbols (ADS) for data transmitting and the remaining 1/3 of the preamble symbols are used as the compensating pilot symbols (CPS) for interference eliminating. Furthermore, observing that the power of the transmitted signal is enlarged in existing IAM methods with imaginary pilots, we improve the proposed preamble structure. Simulation results show that the proposed preamble structure can achieve the same channel estimation performance as the IAM-C method. Moreover, the improved preamble structure can achieve better channel estimation performance than the IAM-real (IAM-R) method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International

Assuming that the most common zero-forcing (ZF) beam-forming scheme is employed by the base station, we aim to maximize the system energy efficiency in bits per Joule by joint beamforming and power splitting (PS) under both the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints and energy harvesting constraints. The energy efficiency optimization (EEO) problem is nonconvex and very hard to solve. In this paper, by exploiting the problem structure, we first simplify the EEO problem to a joint transmit power allocation and receive power splitting problem. Then, with a tactful reformulation, we propose a Lagrangian relaxation (LR) method coupled with Dinkelbach method to address the simplified EEO problem. It is proven that the proposed LR method can guarantee at least a feasible solution, which is a notable advantage over the existing methods. Finally, numerical results validate the excellent efficiency of the proposed algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficiency optimization for multi-user MISO swipt systems","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","doi":"10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230509","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7177532/7230339/07230509.pdf","startPage":"772","endPage":"776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230509","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230509/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficiency optimization for multi-user MISO swipt systems","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230509/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417547","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficiency optimization for multi-user MISO swipt systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0000772.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075013S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230509","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230513,"authors":[{"name":"Difan Tang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Difan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085675620"},{"name":"Lei Chen","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292794400"},{"name":"Zhao Feng Tian","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhao Feng","lastName":"Tian","id":"37085657830"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1948-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1947-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230513","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Radio frequency","TV","Robustness","Approximation methods","Dynamic programming","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","continuous time systems","control system synthesis","infinite horizon","Kalman filters","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear filters","optimal control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online policy iteration","continuous-time infinite-horizon optimal control","neural networks","NNs","optimal control law synthesis","continuous-time nonlinear systems","synchronous policy iteration","tuning loop","logic switch mechanism","system stability","Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation","HJB equation","associated value function","critic-actor configuration","NN approximation","critic NN parameter estimation","extended Kalman filter","closed-loop system asymptotic stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["machine learning","neural network","policy iteration","optimal control","nonlinear system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230513","abstract":"A new policy-iteration algorithm based on neural networks (NNs) is proposed in this paper to synthesize optimal control laws online for continuous-time nonlinear systems.

One of the recent research topics is on improving the robustness of SV system in challenging environments. This paper examines the robustness of current state of the art SV system against background noise corruptions. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the SV system is trained from noise free speech and tested on background noise corrupted speech. To improve robustness of the system, a deep neural networks (DNN) based feature compensation is proposed to enhance the cepstral features before the evaluation. The DNN is trained from parallel data of clean and noise corrupted speech which are aligned in the frame level. The training is achieved by minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the DNN's prediction and the target clean features. The trained network could predict the underlying clean features when given noisy features. Results on the benchmarking SRE 2010 female core task show that by using DNN based feature compensation, the equal error rate (EER) can be reduced in most of the times even when the test noise is unseen during DNN training. The relative EER reduction usually is in the range of 3% to 26%.","doi":"10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230529","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7177532/7230339/07230529.pdf","startPage":"871","endPage":"875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DNN feature compensation for noise robust speaker verification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"DNN feature compensation for noise robust speaker verification","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230529/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417498","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DNN feature compensation for noise robust speaker verification","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0000871.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093694S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230532,"authors":[{"name":"Weiming Jiang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Weiming","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085641071"},{"name":"Xun Huang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085647070"},{"name":"Zhengli Xing","affiliation":["Institute of Electronic Engineering, China Academy of Engineering Physics, Mianyang, China"],"firstName":"Zhengli","lastName":"Xing","id":"37085565121"},{"name":"Lin Zou","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Zou","id":"37531467500"},{"name":"Qun Wan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Wan","id":"37273394600"},{"name":"Guan Gui","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Guan","lastName":"Gui","id":"37085645116"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1948-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1947-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230532","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"abstract":"The N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n Power Nonlinear Transformation (NPT) is a common method for automatic modulation classification, especially for PSK signals.

We employ power efficiency as the performance metric, defined as the ratio of total user rate to total power consumption. The total user rate is related to the number of active users, while the total power consumption includes the transmit power and the device maintenance power, determined by the beamformers and the number of active BSs, respectively. Motivated by this observation, we consider a power efficiency maximization problem by jointly optimizing the active BSs, the admissible users and the cooperative beamform-ers. This problem is challenging due to the fractional objective and the mixed-integer program. To seek for some efficient approximate solution, we first formulate it as a convex sparse problem balancing the transmit power, the number of active BSs and the number of admissible users. A two-stage algorithm is then developed to solve the approximate problem.

We first develop an iterative least-squares (ILS) core procedure to blindly extract the information symbols of the concurrent users. Then, enhanced ILS (E-ILS), a procedure described herein in detail that is based on statistical analysis of repeated independent ILS processing of observation signal, is seen to offer most effective signal eavesdropping.

This paper addresses CS-based sparse channel estimation in practical systems where the measurements are quantized to a finite number of bits. In these systems, quantization introduces two kinds of errors into the CS framework: quantization errors and saturation errors. To combat the effect of quantization error on estimating the sparse channel, a new complex-valued cost function is formulated based on the quantization model. To minimize this cost function, a multi-bit iterative hard thresholding algorithm is proposed. The channel estimate performance is evaluated by modeling the quantization error as white Gaussian noise. Our simulation results quantify the number of bits needed for our proposed quantized CS-based sparse channel estimate to achieve satisfactory performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7177532/7230339/07230546.pdf","startPage":"958","endPage":"962","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","doi":"10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantized compressive channel estimation for OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel estimation","compressed sensing","error statistics","iterative methods","minimisation","OFDM modulation","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantized compressive channel estimation","OFDM systems","compressive sensing","CS-based sparse channel estimation","quantization error modelling","saturation errors","complex valued cost function minimisation","multibit iterative hard thresholding algorithm","white Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quantization","compressive sensing","channel estimation","MIHT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Quantized compressive channel estimation for OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230546/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417597","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantized compressive channel estimation for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0000958.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077084S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230547,"authors":[{"name":"Changxu Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, Sichuan, P.R.

To guarantee fairness among users and avoid heavy burden of backhaul data exchange, we maximize the minimum S-INR based on joint BS selection and beamforming. We formulate this problem from the perspective of sparse beamforming. However, the scaling ambiguity of the receive beamformers will make the sparse constraints trivial. Inspired by the observation that the transmit beamformer is immune to the scaling ambiguity, we apply the duality theorem to the uplink max-min problem under per-user power constraints, and reformulate it as an equivalent downlink problem. An iterative two-stage algorithm is then developed to solve the sparse beamforming problem efficiently. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by numerical simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230547","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7177532/7230339/07230547.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230547","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","startPage":"963","endPage":"967","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint base station selection and beamforming in uplink SIMO networks with per-user power constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint base station selection and beamforming in uplink SIMO networks with per-user power constraints","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230547/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230547/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417442","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint base station selection and beamforming in uplink SIMO networks with per-user power constraints","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0000963.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082229S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7230548,"authors":[{"name":"Junyang Ma","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junyang","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085619167"},{"name":"Zhongwei Si","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongwei","lastName":"Si","id":"37391714700"},{"name":"Zhiqiang He","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"He","id":"37085630454"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1948-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1947-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230548","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"abstract":"A recursive encoding of spatially coupled LDPC codes with low complexity has been proposed in recent works.

(SM) is utilized to overcome the negative influences of inter-channel interference (ICI) and enhance the spectral efficiency in multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Bit-interleaved Coded Spatial Modulation (BICSM) is proposed with the aim of improving the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of SM systems. In our paper, a novel approach based on adaptive dual-interleaving is proposed to enhance the performance of spatial modulation orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (SM-OFDM) systems further. The proposed schemes fully exploits the characteristics of SM particularly and differs the conventional bit-interleaving scheme which neglect the inherent information of SM systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive dual-interleaving can enhance the BER performance of SM systems apparently and provide higher spectral efficiency simultaneously without increasing the complexity of systems, making it an excellent candidate technology for future wireless local area networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230549/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230549/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417537","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"A novel adaptive dual-interleaving and angle detection spatial modulation scheme for wireless communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel adaptive dual-interleaving and angle detection spatial modulation scheme for wireless communication systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0000972.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058015S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230550,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoxi Fang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Zhejiang Wanli University, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Zhaoxi","lastName":"Fang","id":"37289734700"},{"name":"Liyuan Zheng","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Zhejiang Wanli University, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Liyuan","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085608499"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Zhejiang Wanli University, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085609412"},{"name":"Liping Jin","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Zhejiang Wanli University, Ningbo, China"],"firstName":"Liping","lastName":"Jin","id":"37070141500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1948-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1947-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230550","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230550","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Frequency-domain analysis","Encoding","Delays","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","channel estimation","cyclic codes","decoding","Doppler shift","encoding","equalisers","error statistics","radio receivers","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency domain differential modulation scheme","asynchronous amplify-and-forward relay networks","cyclic prefixed single carrier block transmission","asynchronous wireless relay networks","channel estimation","frequency-domain differential encoding scheme","decoding scheme","block-by-block frequency domain differential encoder","information symbols","bit-error-rate","BER","asynchronous delays","Doppler frequency shifts"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Differential modulation","asynchronous relaying","frequency domain equalization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate cyclic prefixed single carrier block transmission for asynchronous wireless relay networks.

In this paper, we consider a primary network sharing a given frequency band with a cognitive network and perform spectrum sensing in space and frequency domain. With the exploitation of the antenna array equipped at the secondary user base station (SU BS), the whole space area in the view of the SU BS can be sliced into multiple partially overlapped beam areas for each frequency subband channel. We derive the energy detection probability of the PUs at a given beam for each subband channel, which is intrinsically the probability of the given beam and the given subband channel occupied by the PUs, and the conditional probabilities of that the PUs are located respectively at each neighboring beam under the condition of the PUs located at the given beam and the given subband channel. Comparing these probabilities with a given threshold, the joint space and spectrum opportunities can be thus determined. Simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230552","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7177532/7230339/07230552.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230552","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","startPage":"987","endPage":"991","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of joint space and spectrum opportunities in cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Detection of joint space and spectrum opportunities in cognitive radio systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230552/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230552/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417416","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of joint space and spectrum opportunities in cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0000987.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050305S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230555,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Wu","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37290990500"},{"name":"Su Hu","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Su","lastName":"Hu","id":"37290175200"},{"name":"Shaoqian Li","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Shaoqian","lastName":"Li","id":"37067156400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1948-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1947-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230555","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230555","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Correlation","Complexity theory","Fading","Timing","Transforms","Communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cyclic codes","demodulation","fast Fourier transforms","mean square error methods","multipath channels","Rayleigh channels","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity time-frequency synchronization","transform domain communication system","overlay cognitive radio","TDCS","symbol timing offset","STO","carrier frequency offset","CFO estimation method","demodulation procedure","cyclic code shift keying","CCSK","circular correlation","fast Fourier transform","FFT","multipath Rayleigh fading channel","mean-square-error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","transform domain communication system","synchronization","timing offset","carrier frequency offset"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230555","endPage":"1006","startPage":"1002","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE China Summit and International Conference on Signal and Information Processing (ChinaSIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7177532/7230339/07230555.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low complexity time-frequency synchronization for transform domain communications systems","abstract":"As an overlay cognitive radio, transform domain communication system (TDCS) has been proposed to support reliable communications with low probability of interception. However, most of research on TDCS assume perfect synchronization to simplify algorithm design. In this paper, we present a low complexity symbol timing offset (STO) and carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation method for practical TDCS applications. By utilizing preamble consisted of multiple identical training sequences, STO can be estimated by the demodulation procedure of cyclic code shift keying (CCSK), in which the circular correlation is performed by utilizing fast Fourier transform (FFT). Thus the estimation procedure is significantly simplified with considerable complexity reduction, which is analyzed and compared to other two conventional methods. The simulation results demonstrates that the proposed STO and CFO estimation scheme is a low complexity solution for TDCS in multipath Rayleigh fading channels with comparable estimation performance in terms of probability of incorrect timing offset and mean-square-error of CFO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230555/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230555/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15417611","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low complexity time-frequency synchronization for transform domain communications systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low complexity time-frequency synchronization for transform domain communications systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"0001002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109663S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7177532","isNumber":"7230339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7177532","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7230339","articleId":"7230555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230556,"authors":[{"name":"Ziying Yu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ziying","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085679485"},{"name":"Zheng Kuang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Kuang","id":"37085685865"},{"name":"Ming Wu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Wu","id":"37877609700"},{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280194600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1948-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1947-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230556","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230556","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Acoustics","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic communication (telecommunication)","acoustic transducer arrays","data communication","electromagnetic wave reflection","equalisers","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","reverberation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerial acoustic communication","single carrier frequency domain equalization","airborne wireless data transmission system","transmitter","reverberation","background noise","transducer array","signal-to-noise ratio","intersymbol interference","electromagnetic wave reflection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acoustic transducers","Wireless communication","Channel estimation","Acoustic applications","Acoustic signal processing"]}],"abstract":"Conventional airborne wireless data transmission system is constrained for applications within the distance of ten meters. However, for some applications such as in electromagnetic shielding pipelines, saps, rooms or hallways, the receiver may be located in a certain distance away from the transmitter where both reverberation and background noise need to be considered. An aerial acoustic communication method using transducer arrays is presented for long-range circumstances.

To solve this problem, improved proportionate normalized least-mean-square based on decorrelation (DIPNLMS) algorithm is proposed in this paper. Due to the principle of decorrelation, the proposed algorithm achieves a fast convergence rate. However, the fixed step-size DIPNLMS has a confliction between convergence rate and steady-state error. Thus, we apply an adaptive combination scheme to address this tradeoff, namely, adaptive combination of improved proportionate normalized least-mean-square based on decorrelation (CDIPNLMS) algorithm.

The decision threshold is derived by use of the Marcenko-Pastur (M-P) law and Tracy-Widom distribution.

The cognitive radio technology has been proposed to overcome the problem of spectrum under utilization. One of the key challenges for a cognitive radio system is to detect the presence of primary (licensed) users over the entire dynamic spectrum at a specific time and a particular geographic location. Thus for effective band utilization cognitive radio provides a unique solution in terms of spectrum sensing techniques. In spectrum sensing, the aim of secondary user is to identify the occupancy or vacancy of a particular radio channel over the entire radio spectrum. This paper presents the performance analysis of energy detection scheme of spectrum sensing. The Energy detector technique is well recognized by its relative ease of implementation. This paper highlights the effects of communication parameters like Signal to noise ratio, number of samples and noise uncertainty on the probability of detection and probability of false alarm of energy detector.

Videos and movies are made up of a temporal sequence of frames and are projected at a proper rate (24 fps for movie and 30 fps for TV) to create the illusion of motion. This means that there exists a high correlation between adjacent temporal frames so that when projected at a proper rate, smooth motion is seen. In different research areas, there is a need for recording events in high frame rates. Due to the high frame rate video constraints, using complex methods are not suitable for videos and will increase the cost of the system and the required storage is also large. Either we have to store the data in database or to transfer video over some communication medium, video size always effect the efficiency. Because of this video compression is required to save the storage space. There are different lossless, lossy and wavelet methods for compressing video sequences. This paper presents the architectures for 2D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and inverse DWT (IDWT). The experimental results demonstrate good compression ratios, mean square error and peak signal to noise ratio.","doi":"10.1109/EIC.2015.7230722","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Advances in Communication and Computing Technologies (ICACACT 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Advances in Communication and Computing Technologies (ICACACT 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7193752/7230684/07230722.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIC.2015.7230722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230684","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete wavelet transform based video signal processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discrete wavelet transform based video signal processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230722/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-11 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"15431396","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7230722/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete wavelet transform based video signal processing","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082127S","chronDate":"10-11 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7193737","isNumber":"7230684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7193752","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7230684","articleId":"7230722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230736,"authors":[{"name":"Supriya Mandhare","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, St. Francis Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7193752/7230684/7230736/7230736-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Supriya Mandhare received the B.

In this work, four layers of security to data have been proposed which will provide highest security to data.

There is an inverse relationship between the PA efficiency and its linearity. Nonlinear PAs are desirable from an efficiency point of view. The price paid for higher efficiency is that it causes growth in spectrum and causes adjacent channel interference. It also causes in-band distortion, which degrades the bit error rate (BER) performance. Transmission systems, like orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), has tolerance to inter-symbol interference and good spectral efficiency but are subjected to nonlinearities of power amplifiers, due to their high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which occurs because of large fluctuations in their signal envelopes. To reduce the spectral regrowth and to reduce BER, PA linearization is necessary. In this paper, Peak clipping, random phase shifting, selected mapping (SLM) and dummy sequence insertion (DSI) methods have been presented to reduce the PAPR and consequently the effect of nonlinearity and to improve the spectral and energy efficiency of PA.","doi":"10.1109/EIC.2015.7230741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIC.2015.7230741","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Advances in Communication and Computing Technologies (ICACACT 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7193752/7230684/07230741.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Advances in Communication and Computing Technologies (ICACACT 2014)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinearity effect of high power amplifiers in communication systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinearity effect of high power amplifiers in communication systems","conferenceDate":"10-11 Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230741/","accessionNumber":"15431384","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230741/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinearity effect of high power amplifiers in communication systems","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04001S","chronDate":"10-11 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7193737","isNumber":"7230684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7193752","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7230684","articleId":"7230741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7230745,"authors":[{"name":"Ginni Jain","affiliation":["ECE Department, GITS, Dabok Udaipur, India"],"firstName":"Ginni","lastName":"Jain","id":"37085590015"},{"name":"Keerti Vyas","affiliation":["ECE Department, GITS, Dabok Udaipur, India"],"firstName":"Keerti","lastName":"Vyas","id":"37085594599"},{"name":"Vijendra K Maurya","affiliation":["ECE Department, GITS, Dabok Udaipur, India"],"firstName":"Vijendra K","lastName":"Maurya","id":"38232033600"},{"name":"Anu Mehra","affiliation":["ECE Department, GITS, Dabok Udaipur, India"],"firstName":"Anu","lastName":"Mehra","id":"37085496792"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7319-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7318-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7317-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230745","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Random access memory","Noise","Threshold voltage","Transistors","Voltage measurement","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","optimisation","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["slew rate","delay optimization","sense amplifier","supply voltage","SRAM memory circuit","voltage swing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sense Amplifier","Offset voltage","Sensitivity","hazards"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230745","abstract":"Output of SRAM memory circuit is very small i.e. in few milli volts. While reading logic 1 sometimes it is read as logic 0. Due to this malfunctioning of circuit, problem of hazards occur. To overcome this problem we use sense amplifiers. The work of sense amplifier is to sense low power signal from bit line of SRAM memory circuit and amplify the small voltage swing to recognizable logic levels so that data can be interpreted clearly by logic outside the memory. Here we have reduced the delay of the sense amplifier by optimizing the supply voltage i.e. VDD. For this purpose tradeoff between delays, VDD and offset voltage has been done. We have examined the results using IC flow tool.","doi":"10.1109/EIC.2015.7230745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EIC.2015.7230745","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Advances in Communication and Computing Technologies (ICACACT 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7193752/7230684/07230745.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Advances in Communication and Computing Technologies (ICACACT 2014)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Slew rate and delay optimization of sense amplifier using tradeoff between supply voltage and threshold","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Slew rate and delay optimization of sense amplifier using tradeoff between supply voltage and threshold","conferenceDate":"10-11 Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230745/","accessionNumber":"15431367","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230745/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Slew rate and delay optimization of sense amplifier using tradeoff between supply voltage and threshold","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041571S","chronDate":"10-11 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7193737","isNumber":"7230684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7193752","xplore-issue":"7230684","articleId":"7230745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7230763,"authors":[{"name":"Linqiong Jia","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Linqiong Jia","id":"37085617824"},{"name":"Jun-Bo Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Jun-Bo Wang","id":"37677215800"},{"name":"Jin-yuan Wang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Jin-yuan Wang","id":"37716383900"},{"name":"Ming Chen","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Ming Chen","id":"37280976800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8475-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8474-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230763","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":338},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230763","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Light emitting diodes","Optical transmitters","Modulation","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","light emitting diodes","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space time coding","VLC systems","CSK modulation","transmit diversity techniques","visible light communication system","color shift keying modulation","RGB LED","Alamouti-type space time coding scheme","RF wireless systems","signal constellations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IBP.2015.7230763","endPage":"48","startPage":"40","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Broadband and Photonics Conference (IBP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Broadband and Photonics Conference (IBP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194240/7230751/07230763.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IBP.2015.7230763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of different space time coding for transmit diversity in VLC systems with CSK modulation","abstract":"This paper investigates the transmit diversity techniques in visible light communication system with color shift keying modulation using RGB LEDs. The Alamouti-type space time coding scheme suitable for CSK signals in VLC systems is proposed, which is a modification of Alamouti coding scheme in RF wireless systems. The signal constellations of CSK signals are redesigned to be applied in the Alamouti-type coding scheme. Besides, The repetition coding is presented as well. Performance comparison has been made between the Alamouti-type coding scheme and the repetition coding scheme. It is find out that both coding schemes are able to extract full diversity order. Simulation results demonstrate that repetition coding performs almost the same as Alamouti-type coding when the same constellations are employed. Our findings clearly point out that the deployment of Alamouti-type coding is not necessary in VLC systems with CSK modulation and the reason for this conclusion is discussed at last.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230763/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7230763/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15418401","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of different space time coding for transmit diversity in VLC systems with CSK modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of different space time coding for transmit diversity in VLC systems with CSK modulation","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570077381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076178S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194240","isNumber":"7230751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194240","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7230751","articleId":"7230763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230766,"authors":[{"name":"Rejin K Raveendranath","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Rejin K","lastName":"Raveendranath","id":"37085392127"},{"name":"Nandakumar Nambath","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Nandakumar","lastName":"Nambath","id":"38232801400"},{"name":"Shalabh Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Shalabh","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37067001700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8475-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8474-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230766","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Optical receivers","Phase frequency detector","Optical polarization","Optical signal processing","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiCMOS analogue integrated circuits","circuit simulation","compensation","detector circuits","integrated circuit modelling","lasers","low-power electronics","optical receivers","optical transmitters","quadrature phase shift keying","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency detector","carrier phase synchronization","frequency offset","transmitter lasers","receiver lasers","optical receivers","carrier phase recovery","compensation circuitry","laser linewidths","BiCMOS technology","DP-QPSK signals","circuit simulations","low power analog domain QPSK receiver","bit rate 50 Gbit/s","bit rate 100 Gbit/s","power 650 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coherent optical communications","frequency detector","Costas loop","carrier synchronization","analog signal processing","BiCMOS integrated circuits"]}],"abstract":"Compensating for frequency offset between transmitter and receiver lasers is a major challenge in coherent optical receivers. This necessitates the use of a carrier phase recovery and compensation circuitry at the receiver end which is capable of tracking large frequency offsets and laser linewidths. We propose a frequency detector which is capable of detecting frequency offsets from -100MHz to +100 MHz. The proposed frequency detector has been designed in 130nm BiCMOS technology. The design is verified with 50 Gbps QPSK, and 100 Gbps DP-QPSK signals using circuit simulations. A 50 Gbps low power analog domain QPSK receiver consisting of the proposed frequency detector consumes 650mW power. The receiver is capable of working with transmitter and receiver lasers having upto 200 kHz linewidth and 100MHz frequency offset between them.","doi":"10.1109/IBP.2015.7230766","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Broadband and Photonics Conference (IBP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Broadband and Photonics Conference (IBP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194240/7230751/07230766.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IBP.2015.7230766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7230751","startPage":"60","endPage":"64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency detector for carrier phase synchronization in 50 Gbps QPSK receiver in analog domain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7230766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Frequency detector for carrier phase synchronization in 50 Gbps QPSK receiver in analog domain","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7230766/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15418402","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7230766/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency detector for carrier phase synchronization in 50 Gbps QPSK receiver in analog domain","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1570080735.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061693S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194240","isNumber":"7230751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194240","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7230751","articleId":"7230766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7230767,"authors":[{"name":"Pravindra Kumar","affiliation":["School of Computing and Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, India"],"firstName":"Pravindra","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085586358"},{"name":"Anand Srivastava","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communications Engineering, Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Anand","lastName":"Srivastava","id":"37085469117"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8475-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8474-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7230767","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":466},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Optical receivers","Optical transmitters","Noise","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","optical communication","optical links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FSO link","OFDM","traditional TDM-FSO link","FSO communication systems","optical fiber","secure communication","bit-error-rate","turbulence strength","receiver sensitivity","Gamma-Gamma distribution","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TDM-FSO","OFDM-FSO","Gamma-Gamma distribution"]}],"abstract":"Free space optical (FSO) communication systems with its high data rate, capacity same as optical fiber and secure communication over unlicensed spectrum have become a promising technology where the installation of optical fiber is not possible.

All inherent advantages of conventional hysteresis controllers like fast dynamic response, simple implementation, switching in one phase at a time etc. are also retained in the proposed controller . The harmonic spectrum of phase voltage obtained using proposed controller is similar to that of constant switching frequency bus clamping space vector pulse width modulated voltage source inverter. In this proposed controller hysteresis boundary is computed online using estimated stator voltages along \u03b1 and \u03b2 axes. The current errors along alpha and beta axes and steady state model of induction motor are used for the estimation of stator voltages along \u03b1 and \u03b2 axes. Hysteresis boundary is computed and using that the vector selection logic is deduced in such a way that the vector switching pattern is exactly similar to that of bus clamping SVPWM technique. Extensive simulation of the proposed hysteresis controller based inverter fed drive scheme is carried out using SIMULINK toolbox of MATLAB for steady state performance.","doi":"10.1109/CPE.2015.7231081","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CPE.2015.7231081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231036","startPage":"246","endPage":"251","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th International Conference on Compatibility and Power Electronics (CPE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190944/7231036/07231081.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 9th International Conference on Compatibility and Power Electronics (CPE)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7231081","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Hysteresis","Voltage control","Inverters","Space vector pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","frequency control","hysteresis motor drives","induction motor drives","machine control","power conversion harmonics","PWM invertors","stators","switching convertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current error space vector","two-level voltage source inverter","constant switching frequency hysteresis controller","two-level VSI fed Induction Motor drives","phase voltage harmonic spectrum","beta axes","alpha axes","steady state model","stator voltage estimation","hysteresis boundary","vector selection logic","vector switching pattern","bus clamping SVPWM technique","space vector pulse width modulated control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current error space vector","Hysteresis controller","Constant switching frequency","Bus clamping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Current error space vector based constant switching frequency hysteresis controller for VSI fed Induction Motor drives","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15418184","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7231081/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231081/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current error space vector based constant switching frequency hysteresis controller for VSI fed Induction Motor drives","confLoc":"Costa da Caparica, Portugal","sourcePdf":"0246lf002526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062617S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190944","isNumber":"7231036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190944","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7231036","articleId":"7231081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":7231112,"authors":[{"name":"Md Rishad Ahmed","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Md Rishad","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"37085509466"},{"name":"Daniel J.

However their configuration memory is not radiation hardened, monitoring and correction of configuration is required to prevent upsets from affecting operation. This paper presents a setup in which a controlling processor has access to the configuration interface and performs the task of configuration memory monitoring and error scrubbing. As blind scrubbing that is simple over writing of the configuration memory may cause erroneous internal contention, read back scrubbing is discussed. Read back scrubbing in turn creates a high load on the processor, so a method is presented in which the read back is still physically performed, but the processor does not have to perform the task of inspecting the read back data for upsets. Instead the frame ECC core which is inside the Xilinx SRAM FPGAs performs checksum calculation for read back data and flags errors. Thereby unlike in a complete implementation of the scrub controller in FPGA logic the software still maintains full control, but creates less processor load. Furthermore this setup uses the JTAG interface which has the lowest cross section for radiation induced error compared to other configuration interfaces.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2015.7231149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2015.7231149","publicationTitle":"2015 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7182694/7231144/07231149.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Read back scrubbing for SRAM FPGAs in a data processing unit for space instruments","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417932","htmlLink":"/document/7231149/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Read back scrubbing for SRAM FPGAs in a data processing unit for space instruments","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"sAp1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071687S","chronDate":"15-18 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7182694","isNumber":"7231144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7182694","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7231144","articleId":"7231149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7231159,"authors":[{"name":"Rob\u00e9rt Glein","affiliation":["Information Technology (Communication Electronics), Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rob\u00e9rt","lastName":"Glein","id":"38468878400"},{"name":"Florian Rittner","affiliation":["Information Technology (Communication Electronics), Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Rittner","id":"37074796100"},{"name":"Andreas Becher","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Becher","id":"37085431511"},{"name":"Daniel Ziener","affiliation":["Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Bayern, DE"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Ziener"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Frickel","affiliation":["Information Technology (Communication Electronics), Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Frickel","id":"37085376900"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Teich","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Teich","id":"37334343700"},{"name":"Albert Heuberger","affiliation":["Information Technology (Communication Electronics), Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Albert","lastName":"Heuberger","id":"37294233800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7501-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7500-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7231159","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":802},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Receivers","Redundancy","Tunneling magnetoresistance","Single event upsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital communication","Earth orbit","field programmable gate arrays","receivers","reliability","satellite communication","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability","space-grade","COTS SRAM-based FPGA","N-modular redundancy","harsh radiation environments","Virtex-5QV (XQR5VFX130)","Kintex-7 (KC7K325T)","Xilinx","geostationary earth orbit satellite application","Heinrich Hertz satellite mission","digital communication receiver"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we evaluate the suitability of different SRAM-based FPGAs for harsh radiation environments (e.g., space).

The advantages of the latter device are: 2.5 times the resources of the space-grade FPGA, faster switching times, less power consumption, and the support of modern design tools. We focus on resource consumption as well as reliability in dependence of single event upset rates for a geostationary earth orbit satellite application, the Heinrich Hertz satellite mission. For this mission, we compare different modular redundancy schemes with different voter structures for the qualification of a digital communication receiver. A major drawback of the Kintex-7 are current-step single event latchups, which are a risk for space missions. If the use of an external voter is not possible, we suggest triple modular redundancy with one single voter at the end, whereby the Virtex-5QV in this configuration is about as reliable as the Kintex-7 in an N-modular redundancy configuration with an external high-reliable voter.","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2015.7231159","publicationTitle":"2015 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7182694/7231144/07231159.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2015.7231159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231144","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7231159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability of space-grade vs. COTS SRAM-based FPGA in N-modular redundancy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231159/","displayDocTitle":"Reliability of space-grade vs. COTS SRAM-based FPGA in N-modular redundancy","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7231159/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"15-18 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417946","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability of space-grade vs. COTS SRAM-based FPGA in N-modular redundancy","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"sDp2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091632S","chronDate":"15-18 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7182694","isNumber":"7231144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7182694","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7231144","articleId":"7231159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7231160,"authors":[{"name":"Jorge Tonfat","affiliation":["Instituto de Inform\u00e1tica, UFRGS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Tonfat","id":"37846459100"},{"name":"Fernanda Kastensmidt","affiliation":["Instituto de Inform\u00e1tica, UFRGS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernanda","lastName":"Kastensmidt","id":"37294370400"},{"name":"Ricardo Reis","affiliation":["Instituto de Inform\u00e1tica, UFRGS, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Reis","id":"37271060900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7501-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7500-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7231160","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Materials handling","Tunneling magnetoresistance","Redundancy","Energy consumption","Maintenance engineering","Circuit faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit reliability","energy conservation","energy consumption","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","redundancy","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient frame-level redundancy scrubbing technique","reliability","design constraint","SRAM-based FPGA","critical applications","radiation effects","soft errors","memory scrubbing","SRAM memories","logic area","internal frame redundancy","minimum energy consumption overhead","FLR-scrubbing controller","mid-size Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA device","blind scrubber"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Memory Scrubbing","Soft Error","Configuration Frame"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7231160","abstract":"Reliability is a major design constraint for critical applications.

Therefore, strong fault-handling mechanisms have to be developed in order to protect the design and make it capable of fighting against both soft and permanent errors. In this paper, a fully reconfigurable medium-grained triple modular redundancy (TMR) architecture which forms part of a runtime adaptive on-board processor (OBP) is presented. Fault mitigation is extended to the voting mechanism by applying our reconfiguration methodology not only to domain replicas but also to the voter itself. The proposed approach takes advantage of adaptive configuration placement and modular property of the OBP, thus allowing on-line creation of different medium-grained TMRs and selection of their granularity level. Consequently, we are able to narrow down the fault-affected area thus making the error recovery process faster and less power consuming. The conventional hardware based voting is supported by the ICAP-based one in order to additionally strengthen the reconfigurable intermediate voting. In addition, the implementation methodology ensures using only one memory footprint for all voters and their voting adaptations thus saving storing resources in expensive rad-hard memories.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive reconfigurable voting for enhanced reliability in medium-grained fault tolerant architectures","publicationTitle":"2015 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2015.7231165","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7182694/7231144/07231165.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2015.7231165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231144","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7231165","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231165/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive reconfigurable voting for enhanced reliability in medium-grained fault tolerant architectures","conferenceDate":"15-18 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7231165/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417925","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive reconfigurable voting for enhanced reliability in medium-grained fault tolerant architectures","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"sEp4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089208S","chronDate":"15-18 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7182694","isNumber":"7231144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7182694","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7231144","articleId":"7231165","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7231169,"authors":[{"name":"Kizheppatt Vipin","affiliation":["Mahindra Ecole Central, School of Engineering Sciences, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Kizheppatt","lastName":"Vipin","id":"38234646500"},{"name":"Suhaib A.

We present CoPR, a fully automated framework for implementing PR based adaptive hardware systems on the Zynq family of hybrid FPGAs. The designer specifies a set of valid configurations comprising hardware modules. CoPR automates partitioning of modules into regions, floorplanning on the FPGA fabric, and generation of partial bitstreams. The runtime framework offers an abstracted view of system configuration through an API that allows the designer to focus on adaptation software without considering details of the underlying hardware.

This flexibility can allow a system to adapt to changes in operating conditions, such as reductions in available power, reductions in available resources (wither due to increases in task deployment, or due to permanent faults) or changes in required performance (processing rate). A unified mechanism which allows such adaptations is presented in this paper, based on the concept of architectural variants for a given algorithm; the different architectures exhibit different resource utilization, performance and power consumption attributes. This allows the system to meet various constraints through the judicious selection and deployment of an architecture variant by the appropriate reconfiguration of an implemented System-on Programmable Chip (SoPC). The adaptive capabilities of the proposed mechanism are experimentally tested on the Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA platform (KC-705) using a video processing application aimed at 720p video streams. Three different versions of the application algorithm are implemented, allowing for performance variations between 3 and 300+ frames/second, while exhibiting a large power consumption range (from 1 mW to 81 mW).","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7182694/7231144/07231176.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2015 NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems (AHS)","doi":"10.1109/AHS.2015.7231176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AHS.2015.7231176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231144","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7231176","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of variations in environmental conditions by SoPC architecture adaptation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Computer architecture","Circuit faults","Adders","Clocks","Field programmable gate arrays","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","power consumption","reconfigurable architectures","system-on-chip","video streaming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environmental condition","SoPC architecture adaptation","run-time reconfigurable computing system","space-borne computing application","task deployment","permanent fault","architectural variant","resource utilization","power consumption attribute","judicious selection","architecture variant","appropriate reconfiguration","system-on programmable chip","Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA platform","video processing application","video stream"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["architecture design","dynamic partial reconfiguration","FPGA","power consumption","run-time adaptation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of variations in environmental conditions by SoPC architecture adaptation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7231176/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417938","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"15-18 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of variations in environmental conditions by SoPC architecture adaptation","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"sPp2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072628S","chronDate":"15-18 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7182694","isNumber":"7231144","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7182694","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7231144","articleId":"7231176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7231177,"authors":[{"name":"Norma Montealegre","affiliation":["European Space Agency, European Space Research and Technology Centre, Noordwijk, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Norma","lastName":"Montealegre","id":"37658768200"},{"name":"David Merodio","affiliation":["European Space Agency, European Space Research and Technology Centre, Noordwijk, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Merodio","id":"37680573800"},{"name":"Agust\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez","affiliation":["European Space Agency, European Space Research and Technology Centre, Noordwijk, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Agust\u00edn","lastName":"Fern\u00e1ndez","id":"37085737939"},{"name":"Philippe Armbruster","affiliation":["European Space Agency, European Space Research and Technology Centre, Noordwijk, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Armbruster","id":"37379077900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7501-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7500-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7231177","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":569},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Space vehicles","Control systems","Aerospace electronics","Program processors","Redundancy","Satellites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace computing","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["in-flight reconfigurable FPGA-based space systems","prospective self-repairing multiFPGA system","failure recovery","European space missions"]}],"abstract":"This paper gives an overview of in-flight reconfigurable FPGA-based space systems.

In relation to this, enough figures showing evidently the better reliability of a FSO system in condition of beam wandering as well as other degradative impacts are attached.","doi":"10.1109/ConTEL.2015.7231195","publicationTitle":"2015 13th International Conference on Telecommunications (ConTEL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 13th International Conference on Telecommunications (ConTEL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209077/7231179/07231195.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ConTEL.2015.7231195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231179","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Link budget optimization of free space optical systems in relation to the beam diverging angle","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7231195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Link budget optimization of free space optical systems in relation to the beam diverging angle","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231195/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15431497","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7231195/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Link budget optimization of free space optical systems in relation to the beam diverging angle","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"MP1AFreeSpaceOptics1570130703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063363S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209077","isNumber":"7231179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209077","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7231179","articleId":"7231195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7231197,"authors":[{"name":"Norhanis Aida Mohd Nor","affiliation":["Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, GB"],"firstName":"Norhanis Aida Mohd","lastName":"Nor"},{"name":"Elizabeth Fabiyi","affiliation":["Northumbria Communications Research Lab., Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Fabiyi","id":"37085648274"},{"name":"Mojtaba Mansour Abadi","affiliation":["Northumbria Communications Research Lab., Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Mojtaba Mansour","lastName":"Abadi","id":"37085444256"},{"name":"Xuan Tang","affiliation":["Fujian Institute of Research on the Structure of Matter, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Tang","id":"37538371500"},{"name":"Zabih Ghassemlooy","affiliation":["Northumbria Communications Research Lab., Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Zabih","lastName":"Ghassemlooy","id":"37267374400"},{"name":"Andrew Burton","affiliation":["Northumbria Communications Research Lab., Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Burton","id":"38242346800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8972-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8971-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7231197","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":235},"abstract":"The increasing demand for higher bandwidth is the motivation behind research studies in free space optical (FSO) communications. In particular, the impact of the atmospheric channel on the FSO link performance has been investigated for decades. Among known channel effects, turbulence is the one, which is thoroughly studied from theoretical and experimental point of views. However, due to limitation of laboratory equipment and channel length, only experimental works in the weak turbulence regime are reported. Therefore, in this paper a dedicated indoor controlled laboratory chamber is used to simulate the outdoor FSO communications for moderate-to-strong turbulence regimes. Instead of increasing the link distance, we generate high temperature gradients along the propagation path of 7 m by blowing cold air in a parallel direction to the laser beam. The performances of the on off keying intensity modulated FSO link is assessed by means of the Q-factor and the optical intensity distribution plots of received signals, thus giving an insight into the level of scintillation achieved in moderate to strong turbulence regimes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 13th International Conference on Telecommunications

13th International Conference on Telecommunications (ConTEL)","abstract":"Recently, Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Cognitive Radio (CR) have received increasing interest from the research community, raising high expectations related to spectrum sharing between mobile operators or exploiting white spaces (e.g. fixed wireless access in rural areas through the usage of locally unused TV spectrum). In this paper, we discuss the key challenges arising from the integration of DSA into the current spectrum management paradigm, usually relying on a \"command and control\" assignment approach by national regulators. In particular, we focus on the consequences for the spectrum licensing procedures, typically laid down in the national telecommunications law. This enables a more general view on DSA and the challenge of integrating different types of applications into a heterogeneous dynamic spectrum management framework, and hence its application to larger spectrum portions. In order to apply dynamic spectrum usage also for a broader range of applications (e.g. Mobile Communications, PPDR, PMSE, or Broadcasting), it will be necessary to redefine basic concepts of licensing, for instance in order to create a permanent possibility for new entrants to acquire licenses for different kinds of usage, or to allow for new applications which might erode existing equilibria.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ConTEL.2015.7231212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231179","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 13th International Conference on Telecommunications (ConTEL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209077/7231179/07231212.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access and the current spectrum management paradigm: On the challenges of dynamic licensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7231212/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access and the current spectrum management paradigm: On the challenges of dynamic licensing","conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15431499","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spectrum access and the current spectrum management paradigm: On the challenges of dynamic licensing","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"TA1BRegulatoryChallenges1570119885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047159S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209077","isNumber":"7231179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209077","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7231179","articleId":"7231212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7231217,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Magueta","affiliation":["DETI, University of Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Magueta","id":"37085377838"},{"name":"Ad\u00e3o Silva","affiliation":["DETI, University of Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ad\u00e3o","lastName":"Silva","id":"37401627600"},{"name":"Rui Dinis","affiliation":["Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia, Univ.

The equalizer is designed to take into account both inter-block and residual inter-carrier interferences by efficiently exploit the space-frequency diversity order inherent to these systems.

We study the performance, at call-level, of a CDMA cell with interference cancellation capabilities, while assuming that the cell accommodates different service-classes of batched Poisson arriving calls. The partial batch blocking discipline is applied for Call Admission Control (CAC). To guarantee certain Quality of Service (QoS) for each service-class, the Bandwidth Reservation (BR) policy is incorporated in the CAC; i.e., a fraction of system resources is reserved for highspeed service-classes. We propose a new multirate loss model for the calculation of time and call congestion probabilities. The notion of local (soft) and hard blocking, users activity, interference cancellation, as well as the BR policy, are incorporated in the model. Although the steady state probabilities of the system do not have a product form solution, time and call congestion probabilities can be efficiently determined via approximate but recursive formulas. Simulation verified the high accuracy of the new formulas. We also show the consistency of the proposed model in respect of its parameters, while comparison of the proposed model with that of Poisson input shows its necessity.","doi":"10.1109/ConTEL.2015.7231218","publicationTitle":"2015 13th International Conference on Telecommunications (ConTEL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 13th International Conference on Telecommunications (ConTEL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209077/7231179/07231218.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ConTEL.2015.7231218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231179","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of CDMA-based networks with interference cancellation, for batched Poisson traffic under the bandwidth reservation policy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7231218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of CDMA-based networks with interference cancellation, for batched Poisson traffic under the bandwidth reservation policy","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231218/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15418878","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7231218/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of CDMA-based networks with interference cancellation, for batched Poisson traffic under the bandwidth reservation policy","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"TP2ADigitalCommunications1570120227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10141S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209077","isNumber":"7231179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209077","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7231179","articleId":"7231218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7231227,"authors":[{"name":"Niwas Maskey","affiliation":["Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT), Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Niwas","lastName":"Maskey","id":"37589406800"},{"name":"Seppo Horsmanheimo","affiliation":["Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT), Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Seppo","lastName":"Horsmanheimo","id":"38279252100"},{"name":"Lotta Tuomim\u00e4ki","affiliation":["Technical Research Centre of Finland (VTT), Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Lotta","lastName":"Tuomim\u00e4ki","id":"37085419470"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8972-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8971-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7231227","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":694},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7231227","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Uplink","Downlink","Quality of service","Standards","Servers","Companies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","computer network management","Long Term Evolution","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE network","M2M applications","machine-to-machine applications","H2H communication","human to human communication","MTC","machine type communication","global 3GPP standard","power mode enhancement","latency measurement","coverage conditions","delay sensitive applications"]}],"abstract":"Smart Grid companies are looking for communication infrastructure to support remote control, automation, and monitoring. But, these companies are not fully confident in budding LTE technology for M2M (Machine-to-Machine) applications, although it has been proved to be a promising technology for H2H (Human-to-Human) communications. LTE MTC (Machine Type Communications) is a part of the upcoming release 13 of the global 3GPP standard. The reliability, pervasiveness, efficiency, and mature ecosystem of LTE make it the major candidate to support M2M applications in the future. However, in LTE MTC, power enhanced power modes are used to extend the battery life in the cost of increased latency. Since M2M requirements are more towards low throughput and low latency applications, it is necessary to investigate the performance of commercial LTE network in terms of latency. This paper presents the results of a latency measurement campaign done in commercial LTE networks in different coverage conditions. This paper is expected to provide utility companies a foresight about the feasibility of the public LTE networks to support delay sensitive applications. Moreover, necessary optimizations required from network operator side to support M2M applications are also discussed in this paper.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ConTEL.2015.7231227","publicationTitle":"2015 13th International Conference on Telecommunications (ConTEL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 13th International Conference on Telecommunications (ConTEL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209077/7231179/07231227.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doi":"10.1109/ConTEL.2015.7231227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Latency analysis of LTE network for M2M applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Latency analysis of LTE network for M2M applications","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7231227/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15418891","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231227/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latency analysis of LTE network for M2M applications","confLoc":"Graz, Austria","sourcePdf":"WA1BMobileNetworkTraffic1570122025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05773S","chronDate":"13-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209077","isNumber":"7231179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209077","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7231179","articleId":"7231227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7231243,"authors":[{"name":"Masayuki Takemura","affiliation":["Hitachi Ltd., Hitachi Research Laboratory, Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Takemura","id":"37085697621"},{"name":"Takeshi Shima","affiliation":["Hitachi Ltd., Hitachi Research Laboratory, Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Shima","id":"37085564859"},{"name":"Shoji Muramatsu","affiliation":["Hitachi Ltd., Hitachi Research Laboratory, Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoji","lastName":"Muramatsu","id":"37341248000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-86348-502-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5601"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5636"}],"articleNumber":"7231243","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":410},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Safety","Vehicles","Image recognition","Lenses","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","driver information systems","image processing equipment","image recognition","road safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded image recognition system","advanced safety vehicles","driver safety","autonomous emergency braking","lane departure warning","image recognition technology","autonomous vehicle","SurroundEye camera system","parking assistance","rear-view camera sensing system","rear view monitoring","active safety technology"]}],"abstract":"Driver safety continues to be improved by advances in active safety technologies.

We have been developing core image recognition technologies for autonomous vehicles. These core technologies can be divided into 3 categories which are front, rear-view, and SurroundEye camera systems.

It is designed through the use of a new computer-aided design methodology and which realizes 819 Gb/s bandwidth across 16 channels and <;10ns read latency on a 45nm DRAM process. The architecture is based on small subarrays with short WL and BL to realize the low latency and energy efficiency. We also integrated several circuit techniques, including adaptive power to speed-up access time and banks rotation to reduce thermal issues. The proposed device is also estimated in a system simulation that shows that the power efficiency is higher than comparable systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A computer designed half Gb 16-channel 819Gb/s high-bandwidth and 10ns low-latency DRAM for 3D stacked memory devices using TSVs","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.2015.7231256","startPage":"C186","endPage":"C187","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIC.2015.7231256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231231","publicationTitle":"2015 Symposium on VLSI Circuits (VLSI Circuits)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Symposium on VLSI Circuits (VLSI Circuits)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7196579/7231231/07231256.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7231256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A computer designed half Gb 16-channel 819Gb/s high-bandwidth and 10ns low-latency DRAM for 3D stacked memory devices using TSVs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7231256/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15418737","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A computer designed half Gb 16-channel 819Gb/s high-bandwidth and 10ns low-latency DRAM for 3D stacked memory devices using TSVs","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"C124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069915S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7196579","isNumber":"7231231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7196579","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7231231","articleId":"7231256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"JSAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7231257,"authors":[{"name":"Tejasvi Anand","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Tejasvi","lastName":"Anand","id":"37587297000"},{"name":"Kofi A.A.

A new mostly-read 5T memory reduces bitcell area by 7.2% compared to a conventional 6T bitcell while achieving significantly better read reliability and voltage scalability due to a decoupled read path. The resulting design consumes 23mW while processing both face detection and recognition in real time at 5.5 frames/s throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 23mW face recognition accelerator in 40nm CMOS with mostly-read 5T memory","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.2015.7231322","startPage":"C48","endPage":"C49","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIC.2015.7231322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231231","publicationTitle":"2015 Symposium on VLSI Circuits (VLSI Circuits)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Symposium on VLSI Circuits (VLSI Circuits)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7196579/7231231/07231322.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7231322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A 23mW face recognition accelerator in 40nm CMOS with mostly-read 5T memory","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15418718","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 23mW face recognition accelerator in 40nm CMOS with mostly-read 5T memory","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"C22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047279S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","isNumber":"7231231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7196579","citationCount":"12","articleId":"7231322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7231323,"authors":[{"name":"Jung Kuk Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"],"firstName":"Jung Kuk","lastName":"Kim","id":"37716990000"},{"name":"Phil Knag","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"],"firstName":"Phil","lastName":"Knag","id":"37085441971"},{"name":"Thomas Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085432725"},{"name":"Zhengya Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"],"firstName":"Zhengya","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292206800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-4-86348-502-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5601"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5636"}],"articleNumber":"7231323","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1130},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Feature extraction","System-on-chip","Throughput","Object recognition","Accuracy","Neuromorphics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","digital signal processing chips","feature extraction","image classification","image processing","neural chips","object recognition","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse event-driven neuromorphic object recognition processor","on-chip learning","sparse feature extraction inference module","task-driven dictionary classifier","parallel neural networks","image patches","sparse neuron spikes","on-chip classifier","voltage scaling","power 3.65 mW","size 1.82 mm","size 65 nm","power 268 mW"]}],"abstract":"A 1.82mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n 65nm neuromorphic object recognition processor is designed using a sparse feature extraction inference module (IM) and a task-driven dictionary classifier. To achieve a high throughput, the 256-neuron IM is organized in four parallel neural networks to process four image patches and generate sparse neuron spikes. The on-chip classifier is activated by sparse neuron spikes to infer the object class, reducing its power by 88% and simplifying its implementation by removing all multiplications. A light-weight co-processor performs efficient on-chip learning by taking advantage of sparse neuron activity to save 84% of its workload and power. The test chip processes 10.16G pixel/s, dissipating 268mW. Integrated IM and classifier provides extra error tolerance for voltage scaling, lowering power to 3.65mW at a throughput of 640M pixel/s.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.2015.7231323","publicationTitle":"2015 Symposium on VLSI Circuits (VLSI Circuits)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Symposium on VLSI Circuits (VLSI Circuits)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7196579/7231231/07231323.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIC.2015.7231323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231231","startPage":"C50","endPage":"C51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 640M pixel/s 3.65mW sparse event-driven neuromorphic object recognition processor with on-chip learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7231323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 640M pixel/s 3.65mW sparse event-driven neuromorphic object recognition processor with on-chip learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231323/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15418716","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7231323/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 640M pixel/s 3.65mW sparse event-driven neuromorphic object recognition processor with on-chip learning","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"C23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045174S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7196579","isNumber":"7231231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7196579","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7231231","articleId":"7231323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"JSAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7231328,"authors":[{"name":"Chun C.

The use of a p-MTJ device makes data-backup-limitation free, which essentially eliminates damage control to nonvolatile storage devices. The use of a p-MTJ device also enables the extension towards dynamically reconfigurable logic paradigm. Since hardware components are shared among all the p-MTJ devices by the use of logic-in-memory structure, the effective area of the 6-input LUT circuit is reduced by 56% compared to that of an SRAM-based one. Moreover, block-level power gating, in which all the idle function blocks are optimally turned off in accordance with the operation mode, can minimize static power consumption of each tile. As a result, the total average power of the proposed NVFPGA is reduced by 81% in comparison with that of an SRAM-based FPGA under typical benchmark-circuit realizations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fabrication of a 3000-6-input-LUTs embedded and block-level power-gated nonvolatile FPGA chip using p-MTJ-based logic-in-memory structure","publicationTitle":"2015 Symposium on VLSI Circuits (VLSI Circuits)","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.2015.7231371","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Symposium on VLSI Circuits (VLSI Circuits)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7196579/7231231/07231371.pdf","startPage":"C172","endPage":"C173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIC.2015.7231371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231231","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7231371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fabrication of a 3000-6-input-LUTs embedded and block-level power-gated nonvolatile FPGA chip using p-MTJ-based logic-in-memory structure","conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7231371/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15451840","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fabrication of a 3000-6-input-LUTs embedded and block-level power-gated nonvolatile FPGA chip using p-MTJ-based logic-in-memory structure","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"JFS32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063506S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7196579","isNumber":"7231231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7196579","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7231231","articleId":"7231371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"JSAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7231381,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Excellent reliability was achieved in 2-Mbit 40-nm ReRAM: 100k cycles and 10 years' retention at 85\u00b0C was demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIC.2015.7231381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIC.2015.7231381","endPage":"T15","publicationTitle":"2015 Symposium on VLSI Circuits (VLSI Circuits)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Symposium on VLSI Circuits (VLSI Circuits)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7196579/7231231/07231381.pdf","startPage":"T14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Highly reliable TaO<inf>x</inf> ReRAM with centralized filament for 28-nm embedded application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231381/","displayDocTitle":"Highly reliable TaO<inf>x</inf> ReRAM with centralized filament for 28-nm embedded application","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15451833","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7231381/","publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly reliable TaO<inf>x</inf> ReRAM with centralized filament for 28-nm embedded application","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"T22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052401S","chronDate":"17-19 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7196579","isNumber":"7231231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7196579","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7231231","articleId":"7231381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"JSAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7231405,"authors":[{"name":"Fahri Wisnu Murti","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Fahri Wisnu","lastName":"Murti","id":"37085737249"},{"name":"Rina Pudji Astuti","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Rina Pudji","lastName":"Astuti","id":"38246106000"},{"name":"Bambang Setia Nugroho","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Bambang Setia","lastName":"Nugroho","id":"38542706200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7752-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7751-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7231405","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Bit error rate","Interference","Rician channels","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","precoding","radiofrequency interference","Rayleigh channels","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser MIMO downlink","MU-MIMO","broadband wireless access","BWA","multiuser interference","MUI","linear precoding","receiving antenna","transmitting antenna","channel response","Rayleigh channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MU-MIMO","MUI","Precoding","Configurations","Block Diagonalization","Performance"]}],"abstract":"Rapid development of Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) requires improvement of system capacity. MU-MIMO is considered as a benefit solution as its ability to enhance the system capacity without additional bandwidth. However, the implementation of MU-MIMO creates interference problem that is Multi User Interference (MUI). Thus in order to suppress the MUI, precoding technique is needed before the signal is transmitted. Linear precoding is suitable to be implemented due to its low complexity yet it has lower capacity than non-linear. One of linear precoding methods is Block Diagonalization (BD) which has flexible configurations so, the capacity can be increased. In purpose to obtain performance enhancement of BD, this study focuses on improving performance and finding the best configuration of BD for BER performance. The research accomplished by analyzing the effect of the change of numbers between transmitting and receiving antenna; and analyzing performance of BD towards different channel response. The result of this research is the performance improvement of BD is in line with adding the number of received antennas on user and reducing the number of transmitting antennas. In addition, better performance can be achieved by implementing BD in lower LOS factor. Therefore, performance of BD in i.i.d Rayleigh is better than Rician channel. By using BD {1,1}\u00d72 configuration, the best performance of BD can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/ICoICT.2015.7231405","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7203317/7231384/07231405.pdf","startPage":"102","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICoICT.2015.7231405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231384","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing performance of block diagonalization precoding in multi user MIMO (MU-MIMO) downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7231405","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7231405/","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing performance of block diagonalization precoding in multi user MIMO (MU-MIMO) downlink","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15418838","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7231405/","conferenceDate":"27-29 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing performance of block diagonalization precoding in multi user MIMO (MU-MIMO) downlink","confLoc":"Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"p102murti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031628S","chronDate":"27-29 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7203317","isNumber":"7231384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7203317","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7231384","articleId":"7231405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7231436,"authors":[{"name":"Arjuna Aji Negara","affiliation":["Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Daerah Istimewa Yogyakart, ID"],"firstName":"Arjuna Aji","lastName":"Negara","id":"37087131728"},{"name":"I Wayan Mustika","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"I Wayan","lastName":"Mustika","id":"37704406600"},{"name":"Oyas Wahyunggoro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Oyas","lastName":"Wahyunggoro","id":"37679993600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7752-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7751-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7231436","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7231436","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Broadband communication","Predictive models","Payloads","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","swarm intelligence","telecommunication computing","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband data payload prediction","particle swarm optimization","seasonal time-series model","telecommunication industry","ARIMA","SARIMA","OLS","swarm intelligence algorithm","distributed-lag prediction formula","mean absolute error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO","Payload Broadband","Prediction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICoICT.2015.7231436","pdfPath":"/iel7/7203317/7231384/07231436.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Information and Communication Technology (ICoICT)","startPage":"278","endPage":"282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICoICT.2015.7231436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seasonal time-series model using particle swarm optimization for broadband data payload prediction","abstract":"Time-series prediction in telecommunication industry has been used as the basic process of decision making of broadband data selling in order to increase the company's revenue.

The new modified fitness function use Mean Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) and Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) to produce more compact and convergent cluster. The proposed fitness function is compared to a non-parametric fitness function proposed by previous research. Experimental results show that the proposed PSO fitness function produce more convergent solution than previous fitness function especially on ultrasound images. This paper also investigates the influence of contrast enhancement to the performance of PSO image clustering and the extracted follicular size. The experimental result shows that PSO image clustering which preceded by contrast enhancement produce larger intra-cluster distance, intra-cluster distance and quantization error than PSO image clustering which not preceded by contrast enhancement. PSO with contrast enhancement produce closer Region of Interest (ROI) toward to the reference ROI which manually identified by

Implementation of neural network on image that has a variety of translation, scaling and rotation without prior manipulated require considerable number of samples. Even in terms of accuracy allows the occurrence of a failure in the decision to recognize the object. Solution algorithm that allows improvement of the problem is Hu Moment invariant. The result values of Hu moment invariant consists seven values that identify characteristics of a digital image. These values are independent of the translation, rotation and scaling. These values can be used as samples for each information object for input of neural network to recognize an object. Ming-Kuei Hu proposed this methode to identified twenty six characters in seperated manipulation. In this study, the unique value of the object produced by Hu moment invariant can be used for neural network input.

The basic purpose of proposed co-design scheme is to save substantial communication in both the sensor-to-controller channels and the controller-to-actuator channels, while guaranteeing optimal control performance of NCSs. Firstly, a switched systems model used to describe NCSs with sampling periods subject to a finite set is constructed. Secondly, guaranteed cost control is studied for NCSs in order to obtain two upper bounds of quadratic performance of systems under the two cases, (a): the worst network communication condition and the longest sampling period; (b): the best network communication condition and the shortest sampling period. After the above preparations have been done, a performance partition-based sampling rate scheduling algorithm is developed to perform co-design strategy for NCSs. Moreover, to calculate control performance in real-time approach and guarantee the asymptotically stable of systems, adaptive controllers are designed in terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) technology.

The smoothness of the control signal is guaranteed by implementing the low-pass filter. Moreover, the oscillation-like phenomena in traditional NN controllers are largely mitigated. Subsequently, the online learning algorithms of the NNs are presented without the need of a priori knowledge of the system dynamics.

Using these models to estimate battery parameters in real-time requires a significant amount of memory resources and computational power to be available. In addition, the ability to concurrently analyze the behavior of individual cells or battery modules in a battery pack would add a significant value to any battery management system. In this context, FPGAs can be a very advantageous alternative to microcontrollers.

Three types of driving behavior such as driving a vehicle towards an intersection for turn-left, driving for turn-right, and driving for go-straight are designed as a set of real vehicle driving experiments to be carried out. The speed data collected by a real vehicle driving experimental platform are arranged into speed time series. Those time series corresponding to the three types of driving behavior had the same number of data and the equal time intervals. To analyze whether the speed time series varying randomly or having a bias, the method of rescaled range analysis is introduced and the degrees of correlation quantized as H-values are resolved and mapped to the fractal characteristics. Then, to search the further characteristics as if the speed time series would be multi-fractal, analysis with a partition function for transformation where real value q as the exponent value, and the \u03c4(q) regarded as a quality index function are applied. As all the curves trends of the three types of driving behavior met the requirement of a multi-fractal object, the multi-fractal spectrums of each speed time series of the corresponding driving behavior are drawn out. The relevant indexes of those spectrums could be regarded as characteristic values for describing or predicting a specific type of driving behavior in the given traffic environment.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTIS.2015.7232055","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Transportation Information and Safety (ICTIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Transportation Information and Safety (ICTIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210493/7232046/07232055.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"132","doi":"10.1109/ICTIS.2015.7232055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractal characteristics analysis on driving behavior time series: Example with speed data as vehicle driving towards an intersection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fractal characteristics analysis on driving behavior time series: Example with speed data as vehicle driving towards an intersection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7232055/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15419276","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7232055/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractal characteristics analysis on driving behavior time series: Example with speed data as vehicle driving towards an intersection","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"201500017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057047S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210493","isNumber":"7232046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210493","xplore-issue":"7232046","articleId":"7232055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7232093,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Wan","affiliation":["Intelligent Transport Systems Research Center, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Wan","id":"37085607545"},{"name":"Jianghui Wen","affiliation":["Intelligent Transport Systems Research Center, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jianghui","lastName":"Wen","id":"37085607383"},{"name":"Chaozhong Wu","affiliation":["Intelligent Transport Systems Research Center, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Chaozhong","lastName":"Wu","id":"37576298800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8694-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8693-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7232093","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Entropy","Electroencephalography","Vehicles","Accuracy","Safety","Physiology","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood pressure measurement","electroencephalography","medical signal detection","road safety","sensitivity analysis","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road rage","traffic safety","management authorities","angry driving behavior","on-road experiments","stimulating events","jaywalking","weaving","electroencephalography","blood volume pulse signals","normal state","angry state","statistical analysis","receiver operating characteristic curve analysis","ROC","transitional period","EEG sample entropy-based driving anger recognition","BVP sample entropy-based driving anger recognition","warning devices","time 110 min"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["driving anger","sample entropy","EEG","BVP","discriminating threshold","ROC curve"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7232093","abstract":"\u201cRoad rage\u201d has been a concern to traffic safety and management authorities. In order to provide an effective detection of angry driving behavior, it is necessary to provide a method for discriminating angry driving from normal. Thirty professional drivers were recruited for conducting on-road experiments in Wuhan, China. The drivers were required to finish the experiment within 110 minutes and their anger was induced by various stimulating events, e.g., jaywalking and weaving/cut-into of other vehicles. The electroencephalography (EEG) and blood volume pulse (BVP) signals of drivers were collected in the normal and angry states from the field experiments. Statistical analysis shows that the sample entropy of EEG and BVP signals was viable to be used as the index for identifying angry driving. Based on the obtained EEG and BVP sample entropy, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was introduced to determine the discriminating threshold of driving anger. The results indicate that, when the EEG sample entropy is between (0.2717, 0.6867) and the BVP sample entropy is between (0.4816, 0.7056), the driver is in the transitional period, which means that the driver can become angry easily when facing the stimulating events. When the EEG sample entropy is smaller than 0.5817 and the BVP sample entropy is bigger than 0.6037, the driver is likely to be in an angry state, with an average accuracy of 80.41%. Therefore, it appears reasonable to use the EEG sample entropy of 0.5817 and the BVP sample entropy of 0.6037 as the threshold for identify driving anger. It is believed that the study results can provide a theoretical foundation for developing EEG and BVP sample entropy-based driving anger recognition and warning devices.","doi":"10.1109/ICTIS.2015.7232093","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTIS.2015.7232093","startPage":"156","endPage":"161","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Transportation Information and Safety (ICTIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210493/7232046/07232093.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Transportation Information and Safety (ICTIS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A discriminating method of driving anger based on sample entropy of EEG and BVP","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"A discriminating method of driving anger based on sample entropy of EEG and BVP","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7232093/","accessionNumber":"15419208","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7232093/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A discriminating method of driving anger based on sample entropy of EEG and BVP","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"201500085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058058S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210493","isNumber":"7232046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210493","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7232046","articleId":"7232093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7232119,"authors":[{"name":"Sara Moridpour","affiliation":["School of Civil, Environmental and Chemical Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Moridpour","id":"37085697885"},{"name":"Toni Anwar","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Johor Bahru, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Toni","lastName":"Anwar","id":"38242705400"},{"name":"Mojtaba T.

The training process of SVMs involves solving a quadratic programming problem which is slow when dealing with large training data. This paper proposes a Least Squares SVM (LS-SVM) method that expedites the training process by simplifying the quadratic programming problem using a linear regression technique. Also, to ensure the accuracy of the prediction results, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to determine the optimal set of model parameters. The GA based LS-SVM approach is tested using real-world travel time data from a bus route in Melbourne, Australia. The comparison of the results in this paper to those obtained in a previous study using artificial neural networks shows that the proposed method produces more accurate results.","doi":"10.1109/ICTIS.2015.7232119","startPage":"264","endPage":"270","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Transportation Information and Safety (ICTIS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTIS.2015.7232119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232046","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Transportation Information and Safety (ICTIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210493/7232046/07232119.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm-based support vector machine for bus travel time prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7232119/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm-based support vector machine for bus travel time prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7232119/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15419280","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm-based support vector machine for bus travel time prediction","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"201500132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065055S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210493","isNumber":"7232046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210493","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7232046","articleId":"7232119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7232151,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Haiyan","affiliation":["School of Transportation and Management, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Haiyan","id":"38180759400"},{"name":"Wang Youzhen","affiliation":["School of Transportation and Management, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Youzhen","id":"37085724065"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8694-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-8693-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7232151","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forecasting","Predictive models","Support vector machines","Neural networks","Kernel","Mathematical model","Modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grey systems","nonlinear systems","radial basis function networks","regression analysis","rivers","support vector machines","traffic engineering computing","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vessel traffic flow forecasting model","support vector machine","vessel traffic flow prediction","waterway planning","vessel navigation management","complex dynamics system","nonlinear system","uncertain system","mathematical models","RBF neural network","grey forecasting","auto-regression","SVM","Yangtze river"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["vessel traffic flow prediction","RBF neural network","combination forecasting","support vector machine(SVM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7232151","abstract":"The research of vessel traffic flow prediction is important basis of waterway planning, design and vessel navigation management.

The results indicate that the percentage of PVs have some influence on data volume which, in turn, affects the accuracy of the data; To obtain the same accuracy data, small percentage of PVs is required in more congested traffic conditions while large percentage of PVs is needed in lighter traffic conditions; In order to obtain the same accuracy of traffic data, the number of PVs needed in congestion condition is more than that in lighter traffic condition though the percentage of PVs is higher in the latter condition than the former one.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232046","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTIS.2015.7232170","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Transportation Information and Safety (ICTIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Transportation Information and Safety (ICTIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210493/7232046/07232170.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"93","doi":"10.1109/ICTIS.2015.7232170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determining the sample size of probe vehicles in different traffic conditions on freeway","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Determining the sample size of probe vehicles in different traffic conditions on freeway","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7232170/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15419261","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7232170/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determining the sample size of probe vehicles in different traffic conditions on freeway","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"201500212.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043253S","chronDate":"25-28 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210493","isNumber":"7232046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210493","xplore-issue":"7232046","articleId":"7232170","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7232263,"authors":[{"name":"Xinyu Tony Jiang","affiliation":["Quanta Technology, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Xinyu Tony","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086438896"},{"name":"Joe H Chow","affiliation":["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Joe H","lastName":"Chow","id":"37285930800"},{"name":"Felipe Wilches-Bernal","affiliation":["Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Felipe","lastName":"Wilches-Bernal","id":"37085686396"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7693-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7692-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7232263","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7232263","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Damping","Torque","Rotors","Sensitivity","Phasor measurement units","Power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","phasor measurement","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generator rotor angle","oscillatory components","phase relationship","terminal bus voltage angle","lightly damping oscillations","disturbance events","PSS","power system stabilizers","damping torque contribution assessment","synchrophasor measurement based method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power system dynamics","synchrophasors","phasor measurement units","electromechanical modes","synchronizing torque","damping torque"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a method for assessing the damping torque contribution of generators equipped with power system stabilizers (PSSs) using synchrophasor measurements from disturbance events exhibiting lightly damping oscillations.

Wide Area Monitoring, Protection and Control (WAMPAC) systems based on wide-area measurements can be exploited to address the inter-area oscillation problem. This work develops a modular software architecture for a prototype WAMPAC control system. A Compact Reconfigurable Input Output (cRIO) controller from National Instruments is used to implement the real-time prototype. This paper presents the design process followed for the development of the software architecture. The design method followed a three step process of design proposal, refinement and attempted implementation. Results from each iteration are used to improve the next. The goals of the design, the challenges faced and the refinements necessary are presented. The details of the final implementation in LabVIEW are also documented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real-time systems","Field programmable gate arrays","Oscillators","Damping","Power system stability","Computer architecture","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","oscillations","phasor measurement","power engineering computing","power system control","power system interconnection","power system protection","power system stability","software architecture","virtual instrumentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchrophasor-based real-time oscillation damping control system","low-frequency electro-mechanically induced interarea oscillation","power system interconnection stability","wide area monitoring protection and control system","WAMPAC system","wide area measurement","modular software architecture Development","compact reconfigurable input output controller","cRIO controller","national instrument","LabVIEW"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PTC.2015.7232288","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210291/7232233/07232288.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PTC.2015.7232288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software architecture development and implementation of a synchrophasor-based real-time oscillation damping control system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7232288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Software architecture development and implementation of a synchrophasor-based real-time oscillation damping control system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7232288/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7232288/","accessionNumber":"15418953","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software architecture development and implementation of a synchrophasor-based real-time oscillation damping control system","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"449298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077078S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210291","isNumber":"7232233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210291","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7232233","articleId":"7232288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7232298,"authors":[{"name":"Simone S.

This algorithm is an approach inspired in the natural selection and evolution of species. The reconfiguration problem of distribution networks taking into account different demand scenarios aims at identifying the most adequate radial topology of a distribution system assuming that this topology is used for all demand scenarios under study. This search is driven by the minimization of the cost of energy losses in the network along a full operation year. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated considering test systems having 33, 70, 84 and 136 buses and a real system with 417 buses. The obtained results confirm the robustness and efficiency of the developed approach and its potential to be used in distribution control centers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7232298/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15431684","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7232298/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Specialized genetic algorithm of Chu-Beasley applied to the Distribution System Reconfiguration problem considering several demand scenarios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Specialized genetic algorithm of Chu-Beasley applied to the Distribution System Reconfiguration problem considering several demand scenarios","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"455457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053167S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210291","isNumber":"7232233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210291","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7232233","articleId":"7232298","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7232301,"authors":[{"name":"Yew Ming Yeap","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yew Ming","lastName":"Yeap","id":"37085410515"},{"name":"Abhisek Ukil","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Abhisek","lastName":"Ukil","id":"37085377778"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7693-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7692-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7232301","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","HVDC transmission","Circuit faults","Resistance","Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVDC power transmission","power system faults","power system protection","power system reliability","signal processing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault change","load change","HVDC system","amplitude tracking square wave","ATSW","power system protection reliability","wavelet transform","fault analysis","time-domain analysis","signal processing techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplitude tracking square wave","fault detection","HVDC transmission","load change","wavelet transform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7232301","doi":"10.1109/PTC.2015.7232301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PTC.2015.7232301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232233","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210291/7232233/07232301.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differentiation of fault and load change in HVDC system using Amplitude Tracking Square Wave","abstract":"For a HVDC system, a reliable power system protection should be quick and precise in identifying fault.

Type and amount of connected consumers (consumer topology) are expected to have a very high impact on power quality (PQ) levels. The usage behaviour of equipment by customers usually varies over the year. Subsequently the levels of PQ parameters like harmonics may show a seasonal variation. The aim of the paper is the identification and quantification of these seasonal variations. It starts with a systematic overview of major factors impacting Power Quality levels and continues with the classification of the typical types of their variation (short-term, medium-term and long-term). Next a two-stage approach based on time series decomposition is introduced in order to quantify seasonal variations by a set of indices. Finally several existing long-term measurements of public LV grids lasting more than one year are selected for a comprehensive illustration of the method. The sites represent different consumer topologies, like shops, offices and residential areas. Seasonal variations are quantified in detail for these sites and selected current quality parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210291/7232233/07232396.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech","doi":"10.1109/PTC.2015.7232396","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PTC.2015.7232396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7232396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seasonal variations in long-term measurements of power quality parameters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Current measurement","Indexes","Topology","Network topology","Time series analysis","Power quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power apparatus","power grids","power supply quality","power system measurement","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power quality parameter long-term measurement","public low voltage grid","electrical environment","nonelectrical environment","equipment usage behaviour","PQ parameter","two-stage approach","time series decomposition","public LV grid","consumer topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consumer behavior","discrete fourier transforms","harmonics","power quality","time series analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7232396/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Seasonal variations in long-term measurements of power quality parameters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7232396/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15431557","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seasonal variations in long-term measurements of power quality parameters","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"460528.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078099S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210291","isNumber":"7232233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210291","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7232233","articleId":"7232396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7232404,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios I.

Superconductors' advantage of providing an almost lossless transmission system, due to the non-existence of joule losses, has been highlighted during the last decades. However, the absence of resistance and its ability to damp oscillatory phenomena, which in case of a superconducting transmission system can be long-lasting, can result in a system prone to instability. Therefore, persisting oscillations that can be attributable to a variety of reasons (ac or dc faults, voltage sags, rapid load changes, switching actions etc.) need to be damped by applying other methods. This paper introduces a method to provide damping in a superconducting two-terminal voltage-source converter (VSC) transmission system by incorporating suitably-dimensioned snubber circuits. The method is generally used in other types of application but, in this paper, its suitability is tested on a specific case reference model built in MATLAB/Simulink\u00ae, as well as under different oscillation causes, i.e. dc and ac faults.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7232404/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7232404/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15418923","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Damping of electromagnetic transients in a superconducting VSC transmission system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Damping of electromagnetic transients in a superconducting VSC transmission system","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"460686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052672S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210291","isNumber":"7232233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210291","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7232233","articleId":"7232404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7232422,"authors":[{"name":"Giacomo Vigan\u00f2","affiliation":["Energy Systems Development Dept.

Compression of the high frequency samples of sinusoidal waveforms into phasors is usually done using Discrete-Fourier Transform(DFT)-like algorithms. The phasor data is normally useful only when the system is in sinusoidal steady state, or nearly so. It is worthwhile to explore means to get reasonably accurate transient information as well, even if it means that some additional compressed information needs to be transmitted from the PMUs. Transient reconstruction has practical utility in the analysis of disturbances (at a remote control centre) and for flagging the initiation and clearing of network disturbances, which may be required for some WAMS analytics. In this paper, it is shown that one-cycle-delayed reconstruction of power system transient waveforms can be done with samples of the dc, fundamental and harmonic phasors reported at a rate of one sample per cycle obtained from the DFT algorithm. For power system transients, a few harmonics are usually adequate to reconstruct the transient waveforms with reasonable accuracy. The paper explains the reconstruction method, presents illustrative examples and discusses possible applications and practical issues.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PTC.2015.7232635","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210291/7232233/07232635.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/PTC.2015.7232635","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstruction of transient waveforms from phasors sampled at the fundamental frequency","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Reconstruction of transient waveforms from phasors sampled at the fundamental frequency","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7232635/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15419117","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7232635/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstruction of transient waveforms from phasors sampled at the fundamental frequency","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"462670.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041439S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210291","isNumber":"7232233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210291","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7232233","articleId":"7232635","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7232655,"authors":[{"name":"Moritz Cramer","affiliation":["Institute for High Voltage Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Moritz","lastName":"Cramer","id":"37085611763"},{"name":"Philipp Goergens","affiliation":["Institute for High Voltage Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Philipp","lastName":"Goergens","id":"37085612183"},{"name":"Armin Schnettler","affiliation":["Institute for High Voltage Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Schnettler","id":"37298498300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7693-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7692-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7232655","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":444},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Voltage measurement","Training","Neurons","Measurement uncertainty","State estimation","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","measurement errors","neural nets","power engineering computing","power system measurement","power system state estimation","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution grid state estimation","artificial neural network","DGSE","training parameters","measurement error identification","bad data correction method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power distribution","Power system measurements","Smart grids","State estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7232655","abstract":"This research project addresses the problem of erroneous measurements for distribution grid state estimation (DGSE) by using bad data detection.

The developed method is validated by simulation on the basis of an electric distribution grid. It is shown that the bad data correction method detects and correctly identifies single and multiple erroneous measurement values. Furthermore, the ability of the developed method to handle different types of measurement errors and the impact on the quality of the state estimation result are examined.

The stability of such systems can be improved by using virtual synchronous machines which add inertia into the system to allow for higher PV penetration without losing stability. A PV-hydro system was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink to analyze the transient stability problems due to PV fluctuations and/or load or generation changes. Virtual synchronous machine was added which reduced the frequency deviations and the high rate of change of frequency. The results indicate that the transient stability of photovoltaic-hydro microgrid systems can be improved by using virtual synchronous machines using a minimum amount of energy storage. However, the power requirements of the virtual synchronous machine's converter was found to be high compared to the overall system size. Furthermore, high PV penetration levels were achieved by adding virtual synchronous machine to the system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210291/7232233/07232663.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech","doi":"10.1109/PTC.2015.7232663","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PTC.2015.7232663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7232663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving transient stability of photovoltaic-hydro microgrids using virtual synchronous machines","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microgrids","Transient analysis","Power system stability","Damping","Benchmark testing","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","hybrid power systems","photovoltaic power systems","power convertors","power system analysis computing","power system transient stability","synchronous machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient stability improvement","photovoltaic-hydro microgrid systems","virtual synchronous machines converter","PV penetration levels","PV-hydro system","MATLAB","Simulink","PV fluctuations","load changes","generation changes","frequency deviation reduction","minimum energy storage amount"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy storage","Hydroelectric power generation","Photovoltaic systems","Power system stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7232663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improving transient stability of photovoltaic-hydro microgrids using virtual synchronous machines","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7232663/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15431604","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving transient stability of photovoltaic-hydro microgrids using virtual synchronous machines","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"462808.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083639S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210291","isNumber":"7232233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210291","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7232233","articleId":"7232663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7232686,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Amin","affiliation":["Dept. of Engineering Cybernetics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Amin","id":"37085395466"},{"name":"Marta Molinas","affiliation":["Dept. of Engineering Cybernetics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Molinas","id":"37352948200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7693-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7692-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7232686","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":943},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Power conversion","Voltage control","Stability criteria","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVDC power transmission","impedance convertors","Nyquist criterion","power convertors","power system stability","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["point-to-point connection","nonlinear model","analytical linearized model","Nyquist stability criterion","HVDC converter dc input impedance","dc system impedance","controller dynamics","system stability","voltage source converter","VSC-based HVDC system","impedance based stability analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Impedance analysis","Stability Analysis","VSC control","HVDC","Nyquist Stability Criteria"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7232686","doi":"10.1109/PTC.2015.7232686","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PTC.2015.7232686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232233","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210291/7232233/07232686.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impedance based stability analysis of VSC-based HVDC system","abstract":"With increasing activities in development of Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based High Voltage dc (HVDC) transmission system, it is necessary to pre-asses their impact on system stability before connecting to the main ac grid.

In the proposed GA method, both network restrictions (voltages and loadings) and unit constraints have been considered, and minimization of the operation costs and pollutant treatment costs have been formulated as objective functions. For network analysis, comprehensive load flow calculations based on Matpower program are conducted in the optimization process. The proposed GA method features a highly flexible set of sub-functions, intelligent convergence behavior, as well as diversified searching approaches and penalty methods for constraint violations. Moreover, a new Li-Ion BSS model with an event-driven ageing behavior has been introduced to the GA structure. In the end, the performance and effectiveness of the developed GA method is verified by a number of optimization study cases applied to a typical test microgrid. The simulation results have demonstrated the capabilities of the optimizer to detect feasible global optimal solution for microgrid UC and ED problem.","doi":"10.1109/PTC.2015.7232801","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PTC.2015.7232801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232233","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Eindhoven PowerTech","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210291/7232233/07232801.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of microgrids short term operation based on an enhanced genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7232801/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimization of microgrids short term operation based on an enhanced genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7232801/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15431678","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of microgrids short term operation based on an enhanced genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Eindhoven, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"476823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079278S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210291","isNumber":"7232233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210291","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7232233","articleId":"7232801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7232818,"authors":[{"name":"Ezequiel S.

At the same time, these unlicensed Cognitive secondary users (SUs) must reliably detect the presence of licensed users or owners of spectrum holes to avoid interference. Precise localization of the transmitting nodes is a complicated but important problem for operation of Cognitive Radio Networks. To ensure the effectiveness of spectrum sharing, it is desirable to locate primary users, secondary users, and unauthorized users in a non-interactive fashion based on limited measurement data at receivers. Localization of non-cooperative objects refers to the process of locating an object that is not intentionally participating in the localization process but still interferes with the radio spectrum. In this paper, we have proposed a hardware scheme to perform precise localization of non-cooperative primary users based on the measurement of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) at the receiver. Among all non cooperative localization algorithms, we have chosen the Weighted Centroid Localization (WCL) scheme. To improve the localization accuracy, a classical propagation model with correction factor has been introduced. A modified WCL scheme has been used for precise calculation of Unknown PUs' Coordinates. The main challenge in RSSI based localization is its high sensitivity to the changes possible in radio frequency (RF) environment. The nature of RSSI measurements limits the accuracy in the estimation. To improve the localization accuracy, a classical RF propagation model namely log-normal shadowing is used. Usually to model Cognitive Radio (CR) the shadowing effects cannot be neglected. If the shadowing effect is neglected, the Path Loss is simply a straight line and becomes unrealistic. To make our model more realistic, a correction factor by way of a standard deviation-\u03c3 has been added to the classical model. Experiment has been performed to simulate different environmental scenarios by keeping all the node positions fixed. Calculation of unknown PUs' distance has been plotted with and without the correction factor for comparison.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7232855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15417986","htmlLink":"/document/7232855/","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Non cooperative primary users-localization in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non cooperative primary users-localization in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"P186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.138455S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7185253","isNumber":"7232836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7185253","xplore-issue":"7232836","articleId":"7232855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7232858,"authors":[{"name":"Naveen Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Dr B R Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar, India"],"firstName":"Naveen","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085617841"},{"name":"Neetu Sood","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Dr B R Ambedkar National Institute of Technology, Jalandhar, India"],"firstName":"Neetu","lastName":"Sood","id":"37404167300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8349-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8348-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7232858","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Wideband","Cognitive radio","Cascading style sheets","Discrete cosine transforms","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","compressed sensing","discrete cosine transforms","discrete Fourier transforms","probability","radio spectrum management","signal detection","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband cognitive radio systems","wideband CR system","compressive spectrum sensing","CSS technique","spectrum sensing interval","subNyquist rate","signal acquisition","spectral recovery","sparsifying basis","empirical wavelet transform","EWT CSS scheme","discrete Fourier transform","DFT","discrete cosine transform","DCT","sensing time","detection probability","system throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","compressive spectrum sensing","sub-nyquist sampling","empirical wavelet transform"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a Compressive Spectrum Sensing (CSS) technique for wideband Cognitive Radio (CR) system to shorten spectrum sensing interval.

Although it is read decoupled, SF9T shows 2.19\u00d7 lower RSNM due to supply gating. SF9T offers 1.70\u00d7, 1.68\u00d7, 1.21\u00d7 higher WSNM compared to UV9T, DF9T and DFsub9T respectively. SF9T benefits from shorter write delay, lower write power consumption and higher WSNM at cost of lower RSNM. The designs offering lower read/write delay, write power, higher WSNM and RSNM are reported, to aid the designer in selecting the best cell depending on specific requirements.","doi":"10.1109/ReTIS.2015.7232929","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Systems (ReTIS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Systems (ReTIS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7185253/7232836/07232929.pdf","startPage":"491","endPage":"496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReTIS.2015.7232929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative analysis of various 9T SRAM cell at 22-nm technology node","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7232929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Comparative analysis of various 9T SRAM cell at 22-nm technology node","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7232929/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417979","conferenceDate":"9-11 July 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative analysis of various 9T SRAM cell at 22-nm technology node","confLoc":"Kolkata, India","sourcePdf":"P303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06663S","chronDate":"9-11 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7185253","isNumber":"7232836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7185253","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7232836","articleId":"7232929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7232933,"authors":[{"name":"Chandrajit Pal","affiliation":["A.K Choudhury School of Information Technology, University of Calcutta"],"firstName":"Chandrajit","lastName":"Pal","id":"38243892900"},{"name":"Pabitra Das","affiliation":["A.K Choudhury School of Information Technology, University of Calcutta"],"firstName":"Pabitra","lastName":"Das","id":"37085727654"},{"name":"Sudhindu Bikash Mandal","affiliation":["A.K Choudhury School of Information Technology, University of Calcutta"],"firstName":"Sudhindu Bikash","lastName":"Mandal","id":"37704500900"},{"name":"Amlan Chakrabarti","affiliation":["A.K Choudhury School of Information Technology, University of Calcutta"],"firstName":"Amlan","lastName":"Chakrabarti","id":"37721797200"},{"name":"Samik Basu","affiliation":["CoreEL Technologies (I) Pvt.

Reversible logic is emerging as an important research area for low power CMOS design, DSP applications and battery operated embedded systems meant for image processing. The reversible logic is implemented using our new proposed RFT (Reversible Fault Tolerant) gates (which is reversible as well as fault tolerant) that is used to design a new innovated adder circuit. The new adder circuit uses very less hardware resource which is again substituted with minimum complexity reversible gate. The proposed design shows invariancy to various image parameters such as scale, rotation, viewpoint and noise unlike other state of the art works.

The control strategy uses a trade-off strategy to achieve both hip and body angle control simultaneously with a single controller, which yields reduced complexity. Hence, the proposed controller allows the hopping robot to track a pre-defined state trajectory in flight-phase despite its modeling uncertainties. The overall dynamics complexity is decreased so that a conventional PID controller can be used for leg extension's length tracking. Unlike other control techniques, no velocity sensor, gyroscope, camera, or body location estimation is needed. Furthermore, no offline learning or a priori system dynamics knowledge is required. Results for different situations highlight the performance of the proposed control approach in compensating for nonlinearities and disturbances.","doi":"10.1109/CEIT.2015.7232996","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Control, Engineering & Information Technology (CEIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194873/7232976/07232996.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Control, Engineering & Information Technology (CEIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEIT.2015.7232996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network balance control of hopping robots in flight phase under unknown dynamics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hip","Legged locomotion","Neural networks","Mathematical model","Robot sensing systems","Service robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile robots","neurocontrollers","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network balance control","hopping robots","hip angle control","body angle control","PID controller","robot leg extension length tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7232996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Neural network balance control of hopping robots in flight phase under unknown dynamics","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7232996/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15418460","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network balance control of hopping robots in flight phase under unknown dynamics","confLoc":"Tlemcen, Algeria","sourcePdf":"PID3671933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058446S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194873","isNumber":"7232976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194873","xplore-issue":"7232976","articleId":"7232996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7233028,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Belkheiri","affiliation":["Department of electronics, Universit\u00e9 Hadj Lakhdar Batna"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Belkheiri","id":"38547135900"},{"name":"Said Aoughellanet","affiliation":["Department of electronics, Universit\u00e9 Hadj Lakhdar Batna"],"firstName":"Said","lastName":"Aoughellanet","id":"38547476500"},{"name":"Mohammed Belkheiri","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Telecommunications, Signaux et Systemes Universi\u00e9 Amar Telidji de Laghouat, Alg\u00e9rie"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Belkheiri","id":"37670501000"},{"name":"Abdelhamid Rabhi","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Modelisation, Universit\u00e9 de Picardie Amiens, France"],"firstName":"Abdelhamid","lastName":"Rabhi","id":"37427941600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8212-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8211-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7233028","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":363},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power harmonic filters","Harmonic analysis","Inverters","Field programmable gate arrays","Frequency modulation","Pulse width modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","harmonic distortion","low-pass filters","PWM invertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based control","DC bus utilization","third harmonic injection PWM strategy","THIPWM","two-level three phase PWM inverter control","inverter output voltage","THD","DC to AC PWM inverter","output LR low pass filter","Altera DE2 development","Cyclone II ALTERA FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["THIPWM","FFT","FPGA","Les","Modulation Index","MOSFETs","PWM inverters","THD","VHDL"]}],"abstract":"The objective of this paper is to design and implement a third harmonic injection PWM strategy THIPWM on an FPGA, to control a two-level three phase PWM inverter, in order to generate a fundamental component, with variable amplitude and frequency of the inverter output voltage, by varying the modulation index and reference frequency.

The design of this controller involves the direct feedback linearization (DFL) technique and the sliding mode (SM) control theory. In this approach, the whole system is decoupled into two subsystems and the state response of each subsystem can be designed to be governed by a corresponding sliding surface. Then a hierarchical sliding mode control approach is designed. The main drawback of SMC is the calculation of equivalent control. To construct the equivalent control law, an adaptive type 2 fuzzy neural network controller is used to approximate the unknown parts of the system. The stability of the closed-loop system is proved mathematically based on the Lyapunov method.

This algorithm aims to maximize the power extracted from a photovoltaic (PV) system with Lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery under partial shading condition (PSC). The proposed algorithm aims to reduce the time wasted during the exploring phase by using a variable sampling time. To do this, a comparator between the reference voltage given by the PSO algorithm and the output voltage of the PV array is integrated. Once the PV array voltage attains its reference, the corresponding power is stored and the next agent is considered as a new reference voltage for the converter. The whole system modeling and simulation is performed and the algorithm is implemented under Matlab/SIMULINK environment. Simulation results show a good tracking speed; the proposed algorithm, at any condition, can track the global peak (GP) in less than 500 ms.","doi":"10.1109/CEIT.2015.7233061","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194873/7232976/07233061.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Control, Engineering & Information Technology (CEIT)","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Control, Engineering & Information Technology (CEIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEIT.2015.7233061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A maximum power point tracker based on particle swarm optimization for PV-battery energy system under partial shading conditions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7233061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A maximum power point tracker based on particle swarm optimization for PV-battery energy system under partial shading conditions","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15418562","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7233061/","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A maximum power point tracker based on particle swarm optimization for PV-battery energy system under partial shading conditions","confLoc":"Tlemcen, Algeria","sourcePdf":"PID3687019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04947S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194873","isNumber":"7232976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194873","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7232976","articleId":"7233061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7233063,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

This paper proposes a particle swarm optimization method for solving optimal reactive power planning (ORPP) problem using Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC). The proposed PSO have been applied for the ORPP problem to improve the system line stability by minimizing the line stability index (Lmn) and to minimize the investment cost of TCSC devices, satisfying various constraints of power flow equation, generator voltage limits, TCSC's reactance limits, transformer tap changer limits, and transmission line limits. The Line Stability Index (Lmn) are used to identify the stressed lines which will receive the FACTS devices (TCSC). The proposed method has been examined and tested on the Algerian electric power system 114-bus and the obtained results are compared with two other methods, namely, Genetic Algorithm (GA), interior point method (IPM). The result comparisons demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach and show its effectiveness and robustness to solve the ORPP problem. Therefore, the proposed PSO can be a promising solution method for dealing the ORPP problem.","doi":"10.1109/CEIT.2015.7233063","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Control, Engineering & Information Technology (CEIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194873/7232976/07233063.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Control, Engineering & Information Technology (CEIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEIT.2015.7233063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimization based reactive power planning for line stability improvement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thyristors","Power capacitors","Reactive power","Power system stability","Stability criteria","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","load flow","particle swarm optimisation","power system planning","power system stability","reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","reactive power planning","line stability improvement","thyristor controlled series compensator","system line stability","line stability index","power flow equation","generator voltage limits","transformer tap changer limits","transmission line limits","genetic algorithm","interior point method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optimal reactive power planning","particle swarm optimization","genetic algorithm","interior point method","line stability index","Equivalent Algerian electric power system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7233063/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization based reactive power planning for line stability improvement","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7233063/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15418492","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization based reactive power planning for line stability improvement","confLoc":"Tlemcen, Algeria","sourcePdf":"PID3687127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091427S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194873","isNumber":"7232976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194873","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7232976","articleId":"7233063","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7233064,"authors":[{"name":"Moez Besbes","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, ENIM, Monastir, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Moez","lastName":"Besbes","id":"37085638667"},{"name":"Salim Hadj Sa\u00efd","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, ENIM, Monastir, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Salim Hadj","lastName":"Sa\u00efd","id":"37544028400"},{"name":"Faouzi M'Sahli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, ENIM, Monastir, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Faouzi","lastName":"M'Sahli","id":"37547157600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8212-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8211-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7233064","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Observers","Induction machines","Rotors","Stators","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous machines","control engineering computing","electric current measurement","field programmable gate arrays","machine control","pulse width modulation","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","high gain observer","HGO","induction machine","Simulink HDL coder","Spartant3E board","Xc3s500 FPGA","three phase supply","pulse width modulation","PWM","stator current measurements","rotor flux estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High gain observer Implementation Field Programmable Gate Induction motors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7233064","abstract":"This paper focus on the implementation in Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) of high gain observer (HGO) applied to induction machine.

The response of this transformation is directly used to create another observation vector.

Simulation of severe operating conditions of a power system is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while stability is guaranteed via Lyapunov synthesis.","doi":"10.1109/CEIT.2015.7233108","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Control, Engineering & Information Technology (CEIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEIT.2015.7233108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7232976","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 3rd International Conference on Control, Engineering & Information Technology (CEIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194873/7232976/07233108.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm based adaptive fuzzy terminal synergetic DC-DC converter control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7233108/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm based adaptive fuzzy terminal synergetic DC-DC converter control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7233108/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15418564","publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm based adaptive fuzzy terminal synergetic DC-DC converter control","confLoc":"Tlemcen, Algeria","sourcePdf":"PID3693895.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065638S","chronDate":"25-27 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194873","isNumber":"7232976","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194873","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7232976","articleId":"7233108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7233117,"authors":[{"name":"Khadidja Sadeddine","affiliation":["Computer Science Faculty, USTHB, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Khadidja","lastName":"Sadeddine","id":"37085668375"},{"name":"Fatma Zohra Chelali","affiliation":["Computer Science Faculty, USTHB, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Fatma Zohra","lastName":"Chelali","id":"37705764000"},{"name":"Rachida Djeradi","affiliation":["Computer Science Faculty, USTHB, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Rachida","lastName":"Djeradi","id":"38111451100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8212-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8211-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7233117","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7233117","abstract":"Deaf people all around the world use sign language to communicate and like oral languages vary from country to another so it is for the sign languages.

For this, attempts have been done via proposing the use of efficient kernel and ensemble method to reduce the effect of outliers for one class support vector machine classifier. However, for the AANN, even with ensemble method, the effect of outliers is still maintained. Thus, we propose in this paper the joint use of ensemble method with a selection algorithm to select the appropriate training samples for the AANN, which leads to better reduction of the outliers' effect and therefore improving the AANN ensemble and classification robustness.

Energy is the major impediment to sustainability of WSNs.

This paper explores how to exploit emerging wireless power transfer technology by using robotic unmanned vehicles (UVs) to service the WSNs. These UVs cut data transmissions from long to short-distances, collect sensed information, and replenish WSN's energy.

However, most of the previous studies have not investigated the impact of sensing on the network level. Therefore, in this paper we investigate network level performance under ALOHA protocol while using autonomous sensing scheme where independent transmissions of CR users are allowed. We show that the optimal system level access throughput can be achieved by solving an optimization problem in terms of parameters configured for spectrum sensing and we also give the range of optimized throughput and the bound of optimal parameter value.","doi":"10.1109/WMCaS.2015.7233212","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Texas Symposium on Wireless and Microwave Circuits and Systems (WMCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190943/7233193/07233212.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7233193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMCaS.2015.7233212","publicationTitle":"2015 Texas Symposium on Wireless and Microwave Circuits and Systems (WMCS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput optimization for cognitive radio under random access ALOHA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7233212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Throughput optimization for cognitive radio under random access ALOHA networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7233212/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7233212/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15418101","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"23-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput optimization for cognitive radio under random access ALOHA networks","confLoc":"Waco, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"Paper26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071999S","chronDate":"23-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190943","isNumber":"7233193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190943","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7233193","articleId":"7233212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":7233219,"authors":[{"name":"Han Ren","affiliation":["University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Ren","id":"38236287500"},{"name":"Jin Shao","affiliation":["University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Shao","id":"38063941100"},{"name":"Bayaner Arigong","affiliation":["University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Bayaner","lastName":"Arigong","id":"38234446500"},{"name":"Mi Zhou","affiliation":["University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Mi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085423555"},{"name":"Song Fu","affiliation":["University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Fu","id":"37274930100"},{"name":"Jun Ding","affiliation":["University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Ding","id":"37085410133"},{"name":"Hyoungsoo Kim","affiliation":["University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Hyoungsoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280373200"},{"name":"Hualiang Zhang","affiliation":["University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Hualiang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37311102500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8069-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8068-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7233219","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dual band","Impedance","Power amplifiers","Power generation","Gain","Inverters","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit manufacture","invertors","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doherty power amplifier","quarter-wavelength impedance inverter","impedance inverters","drain efficiency","output power back-off","frequency 600 MHz","frequency 1000 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doherty power amplifier","dual-band","gallium nitride (GaN)","simplified Doherty structure"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7233219","doi":"10.1109/WMCaS.2015.7233219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WMCaS.2015.7233219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7233193","publicationTitle":"2015 Texas Symposium on Wireless and Microwave Circuits and Systems (WMCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Texas Symposium on Wireless and Microwave Circuits and Systems (WMCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190943/7233193/07233219.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified Doherty power amplifier structures","abstract":"We present two simplified Doherty power amplifier (DPA) structures to eliminate a quarter-wavelength impedance inverter used in the conventional DPA structure.

Pulse code modulation (PCM) involves the periodic amplitude sampling of a video signal and the conversion of each sample into a binary number of n bits. The PCM signal bit stream can be in n parallel channels or be time multiplexed into a single channel. In either case the total bit rate equals n times the encoding rate. We desire to minimize the bit rate in order to save circuit elements and bandwidth, consistent of course with acceptable picture quality. \u2014 A series of subjective tests was conducted to determine the importance of various parameters when PCM encoding an NTSC, 525-line, 60-field, composite television signal. Among these parameters are: (1) the number of amplitude levels being sampled that, in turn, define the n-bit digital word; (2) the encoding rate, both locked and unlocked with respect to the 3.58-MHz color subcarrier; and (3) the role of dither consisting of coherent square waves and weighted noise. The test setup consisted of a color film camera, encoding rate generators, dither generators, A/D and D/A converters, color and monochrome monitors. A test panel of experienced viewers examined the pictures in a controlled environment and rated each picture on a stepped acceptance scale. We concluded that NTSC television pictures that had been encoded with 6 or more bits per codeword suffered negligible impairment. The encode rate should be phase coherent with the color subcarrier in order to avoid beats in the picture. Dither signals did not make any improvement in picture quality except to mask contours during 4- or 5-bit encoding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PCM Encoded NTSC Color Television Subjective Tests","doi":"10.5594/J13463","startPage":"649","endPage":"654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/J13463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7233338","publicationTitle":"Journal of the SMPTE","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of the SMPTE","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225230/7233338/07233342.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7233342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1973","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7233342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1973","displayDocTitle":"PCM Encoded NTSC Color Television Subjective Tests","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"82","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1973","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PCM Encoded NTSC Color Television Subjective Tests","sourcePdf":"10-5594_J13463.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045158S","chronDate":"Aug.  1973","isNumber":"7233338","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7225230","citationCount":"20","articleId":"7233342","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"SMPTE Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7233574,"authors":[{"name":"John P.

Digital comb filtering is also explored as a way to achieve superior color decoding. Encoding PCM NTSC television at the 14.3-MHz rate was found to afford the best algorithms for color decoding. A different PCM technique called Phase Alternating Line Encoding (PALE) permits encoding at 10.7 MHz and allows effective digital comb filtering and good color decoding. In the PALE technique, the phase of the 10.7-MHz digital encode command signal is inverted on adjacent television lines. Straight PCM encoding at 10.7 MHz is a poor third choice for comb filtering and color decoding applications.","doi":"10.5594/J08760","publicationTitle":"Journal of the SMPTE","startPage":"489","endPage":"495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/J08760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7233570","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225230/7233570/07233574.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of the SMPTE","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Color Decoding a PCM NTSC Television Signal","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7233574/","volume":"83","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","publicationDate":"June 1974","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1974","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1974","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color Decoding a PCM NTSC Television Signal","sourcePdf":"10-5594_J08760.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.020207S","chronDate":"June  1974","isNumber":"7233570","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7225230","citationCount":"27","articleId":"7233574","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1974","subType":"SMPTE Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7234286,"authors":[{"name":"William F.

Precoding is performed by individual base stations (BSs) in a distributed manner using only the downlink channel coefficients and user data local to a BS. A cascade precoder structure with an outer precoder managing the inter-cell interference (ICI) and an inner precoder performing mean-squared-error (MSE) minimization-based VP to mitigate the intra-cell interference is proposed. Three different outer precoding techniques are considered. In the first technique, the outer precoder is designed to fully eliminate the ICI by trading off the degrees of freedom (DoFs) available through multiple antennas. While the proposed technique outperforms existing conventional-VP based designs, a large portion of DoF is consumed by the ICI elimination. To overcome this issue, in the second technique, interference alignment-based outer precoding that minimizes the total leakage interference is proposed. To further improve the system performance, in the third approach, precoding by joint minimization of total leakage interference plus MSE is performed. Numerical results show that the proposed cascade precoding structure is an efficient way to use the DoF of CoMP multi-user downlink transmission.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2475237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","startPage":"1491","endPage":"1502","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07234832.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector Perturbation Precoding for Multi-User CoMP Downlink Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7234832/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Vector Perturbation Precoding for Multi-User CoMP Downlink Transmission","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15443731","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"},{"fundingName":"InterDigital Canada under an NSERC-Collaborative Research and Development (NSERC-CRD) grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Vector Perturbation Precoding for Multi-User CoMP Downlink Transmission","sourcePdf":"access-herath-2475237-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129464S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7234832","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7234836,"authors":[{"name":"Parul Puri","affiliation":["Division of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"],"bio":{"p":["Parul Puri received the B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees in electronics\n and communication engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, India and the Jaypee Institute of\n Information Technology, Noida, India, in 2008 and 2012, respectively.

The TWRs use the two time-phase decode-and-forward relaying protocol to establish a bidirectional link between the terminals. For the considered system, we propose a partial dual-relay selection (P-DRS) scheme, in which two TWRs are selected to participate in the communication process. By using two TWRs, the advantages of cooperative diversity are achieved. For the proposed relay selection scheme and assuming Gamma-Gamma fading channels with pointing errors and path loss, we derive an exact closed form expression for the system outage. Further, we derive an asymptotic expression for average error probability. The diversity order of the system is also presented. It is shown by numerical analysis that by using the proposed P-DRS scheme, the system performance can be significantly improved.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7273735/07234836.pdf","startPage":"4457","endPage":"4463","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2475609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2475609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273735","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7234836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial Dual-Relay Selection Protocols in Two-Way Relayed FSO Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Protocols","Adaptive optics","Closed-form solutions","Optical receivers","Atmospheric modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decode and forward communication","error statistics","fading channels","free-space optical communication","optical links","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical analysis","diversity order","error probability","asymptotic expression","system outage","exact closed form expression","path loss","pointing errors","Gamma-Gamma fading channels","cooperative diversity","communication process","bidirectional link","time-phase decode-and-forward relaying protocol","multiple two-way relays","nonline-of-sight terminal nodes","parallel relayed free-space optical communication network","two-way relayed FSO networks","partial dual-relay selection protocols"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["decode-and-forward","free-space optical systems","Gamma-Gamma distribution","Meijer\u2019s G-function","pointing error","partial relay selection","partial relay selection"]},{"kwd":["Decode-and-forward","free-space optical systems","Gamma\u2013Gamma distribution","Meijer's G-function","partial relay selection","pointing error","two-way relay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1, 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Partial Dual-Relay Selection Protocols in Two-Way Relayed FSO Networks","volume":"33","issue":"21","htmlLink":"/document/7234836/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Nov.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15644117","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial Dual-Relay Selection Protocols in Two-Way Relayed FSO Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-garg-2475609-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070844S","chronDate":"Nov.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7273735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7273735","articleId":"7234836","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7234839,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Toole","affiliation":["Lightwave and Microwave Photonics Laboratory, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ryan Toole (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in physics and\n astronomy from the University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA, in 2013, where he is currently working toward the M.S.\n degree in engineering in the Lightwave and Microwave Photonics Laboratory.

Strong mode coupling and GD compensation (concatenating different fibers with opposing GD ordering) are two approaches for reducing the end-to-end GD spread. In this paper, we study the GD behavior in systems where mode coupling and GD compensation are both present. Using a propagation model in generalized Stokes space, we describe the evolution of the GD variance by coupled differential equations. By integration of these equations, we evaluate the GD variance in GD compensated systems with different mode coupling lengths and GD compensation lengths. When the mode coupling length is much longer than the GD compensation length, a low GD variance can be obtained as a result of GD compensation. By contrast, when the mode coupling length is much shorter than the GD compensation length, GD compensation becomes ineffective, but a low GD variance can be obtained as a result of strong mode coupling. The largest GD variance is obtained when the mode coupling length is comparable to the GD compensation length.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2475422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2475422","startPage":"4504","endPage":"4512","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7273735/07234843.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273735","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay Spread Reduction in Mode-Division Multiplexing: Mode Coupling Versus Delay Compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1, 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Delay Spread Reduction in Mode-Division Multiplexing: Mode Coupling Versus Delay Compensation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Nov.1, 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","volume":"33","issue":"21","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7234843/","accessionNumber":"15484757","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234843/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Google Research Award and by Corning, Inc."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay Spread Reduction in Mode-Division Multiplexing: Mode Coupling Versus Delay Compensation","sourcePdf":"jlt-arik-2475422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105872S","chronDate":"Nov.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7273735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7273735","articleId":"7234843","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7234849,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Chun Lee","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Chun","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085345993"},{"name":"Wei-Ho Chung","affiliation":["Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Ho","lastName":"Chung","id":"37538749800"},{"name":"Ta-Sung Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ta-Sung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37277273300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7234849","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Bit error rate","Modulation","MIMO","Resource management","Algorithm design and analysis","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","modulation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["limited feedback precoder design","spatial modulation","training set","bit error rate enhancement","multiple-input multiple-output systems","SM-MIMO systems","codebook design"]},{"kwd":["Spatial modulation","MIMO","precoder","codebook","limited feedback"]}],"abstract":"We investigate the limited feedback precoding for spatial modulation in multiple-input multiple-output systems via using the codebook.

In C-RAN, one data processing center or baseband unit (BBU) communicates with users via distributed remote radio heads (RRHs), which are connected to the BBU via high capacity, low latency fronthaul links. In this paper, we study the compression on fronthaul uplinks and propose a joint decompression algorithm at the BBU. The central premise behind the proposed algorithm is to exploit the correlation between RRHs. Our contribution is threefold. First, we propose a joint decompression and detection (JDD) algorithm which jointly performs decompressing and detecting. The JDD algorithm takes into consideration both the fading and compression effect in a single decoding step. Second, block error rate (BLER) of the proposed algorithm is analyzed in closed-form by using pair-wise error probability analysis. Third, based on the analyzed BLER, we propose adaptive compression schemes subject to quality of service (QoS) constraints to minimize the fronthaul transmission rate while satisfying the pre-defined target QoS. As a dual problem, we also propose a scheme to minimize the signal distortion subject to fronthaul rate constraint. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive compression schemes can achieve a compression ratio of 300% in experimental setups.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2475430","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07234851.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2475430","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","startPage":"4565","endPage":"4575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Compression and Joint Detection for Fronthaul Uplinks in Cloud Radio Access Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7234851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Compression and Joint Detection for Fronthaul Uplinks in Cloud Radio Access Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234851/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676751","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7234851/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"A*STAR SERC","grantNumber":"1224104048"},{"fundingName":"MOE ARF Tier 2","grantNumber":"MOE2014-T2-2-002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Compression and Joint Detection for Fronthaul Uplinks in Cloud Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-vu-2475430-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077159S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7234851","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7234857,"authors":[{"name":"Kritsada Mamat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7234857/mamat-2475420_print-small.gif","p":["\nKritsada Mamat received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Burapha University, Chonburi, Thailand, in 2007 and the M.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Kasetsart University, Bangkok, Thailand, in 2010.

For the first method, a receiver with perfect channel information, quantizes and feeds back the optimal transmit beamforming vectors of a few selected subcarriers, which are equally spaced. Based on those quantized vectors, the transmitter applies either constant, linear, or higher-order interpolation with the remaining beamforming vectors. With constant interpolation, we derive the approximate sum achievable rate and the optimal cluster size that maximizes the approximate rate. For linear interpolation, we derive a closed-form expression for the phase rotation by utilizing the correlation between OFDM subcarriers. We also propose a higher-order interpolation that requires more than two quantized vectors to interpolate transmit beamformers, and is based on existing channel estimation methods. Numerical results show that interpolation with the optimized cluster size can perform significantly better than that with an arbitrary cluster size. For the second proposed method, a channel impulse response is quantized with a uniform scalar quantizer. With channel quantization, we also derive the approximate sum achievable rate. We show that switching between the two methods for different feedback-rate requirements can perform better than the existing schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2475420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07234857.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2475420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","startPage":"4202","endPage":"4213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Transmit Beamforming for MISO-OFDM Channels With Finite-Rate Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7234857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Transmit Beamforming for MISO-OFDM Channels With Finite-Rate Feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234857/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676729","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7234857/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"2010 Telecommunications Research and Industrial Development Institute (TRIDI)"},{"fundingName":"Thailand Commission on Higher Education"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004396","fundingName":"Thailand Research Fund"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004539","fundingName":"Kasetsart University","grantNumber":"MRG5580236"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Transmit Beamforming for MISO-OFDM Channels With Finite-Rate Feedback","sourcePdf":"tcomm-santipach-2475420-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105215S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7234857","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7234862,"authors":[{"name":"Ertu\u011frul Ba\u015far","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ertu\u011frul","lastName":"Ba\u015far","id":"38666344600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7234862","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":108,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2481},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7234862","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Indexes","MIMO","Modulation","Receiving antennas","Noise measurement","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-input multiple-output OFDM scheme","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation","novel multicarrier transmission technique","MIMO-OFDM-IM scheme","low complexity transceiver structure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G wireless networks","index modulation","MIMO systems","MMSE detection","OFDM","V-BLAST"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM) is a novel multicarrier transmission technique which has been proposed as an alternative to classical OFDM.

A smart home consists of low capacity devices (e.g., sensors) and wireless networks, and therefore, all working together as a secure system that needs an adequate level of security. This paper introduces lightweight and secure session key establishment scheme for smart home environments. To establish trust among the network, every sensor and control unit uses a short authentication token and establishes a secure session key. The proposed scheme provides important security attributes including prevention of various popular attacks, such as denial-of-service and eavesdropping attacks. The preliminary evaluation and feasibility tests are demonstrated by the proof-of-concept implementation. In addition, the proposed scheme attains both computation efficiency and communication efficiency as compared with other schemes from the literature.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7352393/07234863.pdf","startPage":"254","endPage":"264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2475298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2475298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352393","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7234863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightweight and Secure Session-Key Establishment Scheme in Smart Home Environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart homes","Authentication","Logic gates","Protocols","Intelligent sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","data privacy","home networks","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["proof-of-concept implementation","eavesdropping attack","denial-of-service","sensor","lightweight secure session key establishment scheme","wireless network","information technology","wireless communication","smart home environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Authentication","access control","security","smart homes","wireless sensor networks"]},{"kwd":["Authentication","access control","security","smart homes","wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Lightweight and Secure Session-Key Establishment Scheme in Smart Home Environments","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7234863/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15677571","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"TEKES under Project The Naked Approach"},{"fundingName":"RFBR research project","grantNumber":"14-07-00252"},{"fundingName":"Dependable Wireless Healthcare Networks"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightweight and Secure Session-Key Establishment Scheme in Smart Home Environments","sourcePdf":"jsen-kumar-2475298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128608S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7352393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"7352393","articleId":"7234863","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7234869,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoli Xi","affiliation":["Faculty of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an University of Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoli","lastName":"Xi","id":"37605455600"},{"name":"Zhengwei Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an University of Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Zhengwei","lastName":"Li","id":"37085416314"},{"name":"Jiangfan Liu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Space Microwave Laboratory, Xi\u2019an University of Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jiangfan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598331900"},{"name":"Jinsheng Zhang","affiliation":["Xi\u2019an High-Tech Institute, Xi\u2019an University of Technology, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jinsheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38067949700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7234869","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":557},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"The finite-different time-domain (FDTD) method is applied to solve wave propagation in anisotropic dispersive materials by means of bilinear transform (BT) technique.

While threshold-based segmentation methods have shown modest success, probabilistic models, such as hidden Markov models, have recently been shown to surpass the capabilities of previous methods. Segmentation performance is further improved when apriori information about the expected duration of the states is incorporated into the model, such as in a hidden semiMarkov model (HSMM). This paper addresses the problem of the accurate segmentation of the first and second heart sound within noisy real-world PCG recordings using an HSMM, extended with the use of logistic regression for emission probability estimation. In addition, we implement a modified Viterbi algorithm for decoding the most likely sequence of states, and evaluated this method on a large dataset of 10 172 s of PCG recorded from 112 patients (including 12 181 first and 11 627 second heart sounds). The proposed method achieved an average F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n score of 95.63 \u00b1 0.85%, while the current state of the art achieved 86.28 \u00b1 1.55% when evaluated on unseen test recordings. The greater discrimination between states afforded using logistic regression as opposed to the previous Gaussian distribution-based emission probability estimation as well as the use of an extended Viterbi algorithm allows this method to significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art method based on a two-sided paired t-test.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2475278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7435363/07234876.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2475278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7435363","startPage":"822","endPage":"832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Logistic Regression-HSMM-Based Heart Sound Segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7234876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Logistic Regression-HSMM-Based Heart Sound Segmentation","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234876/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15869899","pubMedId":"26340769","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7234876/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Rhodes Trust"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Logistic Regression-HSMM-Based Heart Sound Segmentation","sourcePdf":"tbme-springer-2475278-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132782S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7435363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"7435363","articleId":"7234876","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7234877,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed M.

Although a number of approximate expressions for the probability of error in OFDM systems with integer time offset can be found in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that provides exact expressions. In particular, we derive exact closed-form expressions for the bit error rate (BER) and the symbol error rate (SER) of BPSK, QPSK, and 16-QAM modulation for transmission over both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels. The effect of the fractional carrier frequency offset (CFO) is taken into consideration in the derivations. This makes the derived expressions more useful in evaluating the probability of error for OFDM systems with CFO only, especially in cases like 16-QAM modulation for transmission over Rayleigh fading channels where exact closed-form expressions are not available. For OFDM systems with a large number of subcarriers, an approximate method for evaluating the BER/SER is given. Finally, numerical results are included to demonstrate the exactness of the derived expressions and the accuracy of the approximate method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Time-frequency analysis","Interference","Frequency modulation","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","error statistics","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-form expression","OFDM system","BER","integer time offset","error probability","bit error rate","symbol error rate","BPSK","QPSK","QAM modulation","AWGN channel","Rayleigh fading channel","fractional carrier frequency offset","CFO","SER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit error rate (BER)","symbol error rate (SER)","time offset","frequency offset","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]},{"kwd":["Bit error rate (BER)","symbol error rate (SER)","time offset","frequency offset","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7234877","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2475417","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07234877.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2475417","startPage":"4461","endPage":"4473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-Form Expressions for the BER/SER of OFDM Systems With an Integer Time Offset","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Closed-Form Expressions for the BER/SER of OFDM Systems With an Integer Time Offset","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234877/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","volume":"63","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7234877/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676748","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","grantNumber":"RGP1N7779"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-Form Expressions for the BER/SER of OFDM Systems With an Integer Time Offset","sourcePdf":"tcomm-hamza-2475417-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083306S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7234877","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7234880,"authors":[{"name":"Payam Nayeri","affiliation":["Colorado School of Mines, Golden, CO, US"],"bio":{"p":["Payam Nayeri (pnayeri@mines.edu) received his B.

In this scheme, a reduced-rank framework is employed for linear receive processing and multiuser interference suppression based on the minimization of the symbol-error-rate (SER) cost function. We present a structure with multiple processing branches that performs a dimensionality reduction, where each branch contains a group of jointly optimized preprocessing and decimation units, followed by a linear receive filter. We then develop stochastic gradient (SG) algorithms to compute the parameters of the preprocessing and receive filters, along with a low-complexity decimation technique for both binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) symbols. In addition, an automatic parameter selection scheme is proposed to further improve the convergence performance of the proposed reduced-rank algorithms. Simulation results are presented for time-varying wireless environments and show that the proposed JPDF minimum-SER receive processing strategy and algorithms achieve a superior performance than existing methods with a reduced computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2475260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07234882.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2475260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","startPage":"4185","endPage":"4201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Reduced-Rank Receive Processing Based on Minimum Symbol-Error-Rate Criterion for Large-Scale Multiple-Antenna Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7234882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Reduced-Rank Receive Processing Based on Minimum Symbol-Error-Rate Criterion for Large-Scale Multiple-Antenna Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234882/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676724","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7234882/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471319"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LY14F010013"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2014AA01A707"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Reduced-Rank Receive Processing Based on Minimum Symbol-Error-Rate Criterion for Large-Scale Multiple-Antenna Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-cai-2475260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106162S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7234882","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7234886,"authors":[{"name":"Tsung-Han Chan","affiliation":["MediaTek Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7271151/7234886/chan-2475625-small.gif","p":["Tsung-Han Chan (S\u201908\u2013M\u201909) received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Yuan Ze University, Taiwan, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, in 2009.

In the proposed architecture, the PCA is employed to learn multistage filter banks. This is followed by simple binary hashing and block histograms for indexing and pooling. This architecture is thus called the PCA network (PCANet) and can be extremely easily and efficiently designed and learned. For comparison and to provide a better understanding, we also introduce and study two simple variations of PCANet: 1) RandNet and 2) LDANet. They share the same topology as PCANet, but their cascaded filters are either randomly selected or learned from linear discriminant analysis. We have extensively tested these basic networks on many benchmark visual data sets for different tasks, including Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) for face verification; the MultiPIE, Extended Yale B, AR, Facial Recognition Technology (FERET) data sets for face recognition; and MNIST for hand-written digit recognition. Surprisingly, for all tasks, such a seemingly naive PCANet model is on par with the state-of-the-art features either prefixed, highly hand-crafted, or carefully learned [by deep neural networks (DNNs)]. Even more surprisingly, the model sets new records for many classification tasks on the Extended Yale B, AR, and FERET data sets and on MNIST variations. Additional experiments on other public data sets also demonstrate the potential of PCANet to serve as a simple but highly competitive baseline for texture classification and object recognition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234886/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"24","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15472753","pubMedId":"26340772","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7234886/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"PCANet: A Simple Deep Learning Baseline for Image Classification?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PCANet: A Simple Deep Learning Baseline for Image Classification?","sourcePdf":"tip-chan-2475625-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.264278S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"736","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7234886","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7234893,"authors":[{"name":"Jinping Hao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7287829/7234893/jihao-2475695-small.gif","p":["Jinping Hao (S\u201913) received the B.Eng. degree in electronic and information engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2010; the B.Eng. degree (first class Hons.) in electronic and communication engineering from the University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K., in 2010; and the M.Sc. degree (with Distinction) in wireless communication and signal processing from the University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K., in 2011.

First, methods of constructing sparse stealth attacks are developed for two typical scenarios: 1) random attacks in which arbitrary measurements can be compromised; and 2) targeted attacks in which specified state variables are modified. It is already demonstrated that stealth attacks can always exist if the number of compromised measurements exceeds a certain value. In this paper, it is found that random undetectable attacks can be accomplished by modifying only a much smaller number of measurements than this value. It is well known that protecting the system from malicious attacks can be achieved by making a certain subset of measurements immune to attacks. An efficient greedy search algorithm is then proposed to quickly find this subset of measurements to be protected to defend against stealth attacks. It is shown that this greedy algorithm has almost the same performance as the brute-force method, but without the combinatorial complexity. Third, a robust attack detection method is discussed. The detection method is designed based on the robust principal component analysis problem by introducing element-wise constraints. This method is shown to be able to identify the real measurements, as well as attacks even when only partial observations are collected. The simulations are conducted based on IEEE test systems.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2015.2475695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7287829/07234893.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2015.2475695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Malicious False Data Injection Attacks and Defense Mechanisms in Smart Grids","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7234893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Malicious False Data Injection Attacks and Defense Mechanisms in Smart Grids","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234893/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15489144","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7234893/","volume":"11","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Dorothy Hodgkin Postgraduate Award Scholarship"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Sparse Malicious False Data Injection Attacks and Defense Mechanisms in Smart Grids","sourcePdf":"tii-hao-2475695-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16475S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7287829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"7287829","articleId":"7234893","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7234900,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Shi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, Vic., China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7377137/7234900/shi-2475515-small.gif","p":["\n\nPeng Shi (F'15) received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Harbin \nInstitute of Technology, Harbin, China, the M.E. degree in systems engineering from Harbin Engineering University, \nHarbin, the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, Australia, the Ph.D. \ndegree in mathematics from the University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia, the D.Sc. degree from the University \nof Glamorgan, Trefforest, U.K., and the D.Eng. degree from the University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.","He is currently a Professor with The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, and Victoria University, Melbourne, \nAustralia, and a Professor with the College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China.

Four issues were in focus for the analysis: precision, realization of the wireless communication channel, coupling between the probes, and the influence of the test object size. The analysis shows that a large test object such as a car in an OTA multiprobe ring will affect the measurement uncertainty, but only to a small degree. The measurement uncertainty expressed as expanded uncertainty was below +/-1 dB, which is a level that would not violate best practice total uncertainty levels for comparable OTA methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurement Uncertainty, Channel Simulation, and Disturbance Characterization of an Over-the-Air Multiprobe Setup for Cars at 5.9 GHz","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2475423","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7322317/07234918.pdf","startPage":"7859","endPage":"7869","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2475423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7234918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234918/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Measurement Uncertainty, Channel Simulation, and Disturbance Characterization of an Over-the-Air Multiprobe Setup for Cars at 5.9 GHz","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7234918/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587134","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems\u2014VINNOVA"},{"fundingName":"Wireless Communication in Automotive Environment"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurement Uncertainty, Channel Simulation, and Disturbance Characterization of an Over-the-Air Multiprobe Setup for Cars at 5.9 GHz","sourcePdf":"tie-nilsson-2475423-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123053S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7322317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7322317","articleId":"7234918","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7234919,"authors":[{"name":"Teng Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Collaborative and Innovative Center for Electric Vehicles and the School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7322317/7234919/tliu-2475419-small.gif","p":["\n\nTeng Liu received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2011.

A control oriented model of the HETV is first established, in which the state-of-charge (SOC) of battery and the speed of generator are the state variables, and the engine's torque is the control variable. Subsequently, a transition probability matrix is learned from a specific driving schedule of the HETV. The proposed RLAEM decides appropriate power split between the battery and engine-generator set (EGS) to minimize the fuel consumption over different driving schedules. With the RLAEM, not only is driver's power requirement guaranteed, but also the fuel economy is improved as well. Finally, the RLAEM is compared with the stochastic dynamic programming (SDP)-based energy management for different driving schedules. The simulation results demonstrate the adaptability, optimality, and learning ability of the RLAEM and its capacity of reducing the computation time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234919/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"62","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15587099","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7234919/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement Learning of Adaptive Energy Management With Transition Probability for a Hybrid Electric Tracked Vehicle","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51375044"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B12022"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement Learning of Adaptive Energy Management With Transition Probability for a Hybrid Electric Tracked Vehicle","sourcePdf":"tie-zou-2475419-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119113S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7322317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"7322317","articleId":"7234919","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7234920,"authors":[{"name":"Bartolomeo Montrucchio","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221037/7317675/7234920/montr-small.gif","p":["Bartolomeo Montrucchio (M\u201902) received the M.S. degree in\n electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy, in\n 1998, and 2002, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor of computer engineering with the Department of Computer Engineering,\n Politecnico di Torino.

Then, we derive an approximate closed-form expression of the spectral efficiency to find the optimal lengths of uplink and downlink pilots. Simulation results show that the achieved spectral efficiency can be improved due to channel estimation at the user side, but in comparison with a single-cell scenario, the spectral efficiency per cell in multicell scenario degrades because of pilot contamination. We focus on the practical case where the number of base station (BS) antennas is large but still finite and propose the BT and PCP (BT-PCP) transmission scheme to mitigate the pilot contamination with limited cooperation between BSs. We confirm the effectiveness of the proposed BT-PCP scheme with simulation, and we show that the proposed BT-PCP scheme achieves higher spectral efficiency than the conventional PCP method and that the performance gap from the perfect channel state information (CSI) scenario without pilot contamination is small.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2475284","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07234921.pdf","startPage":"6301","endPage":"6314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2475284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicell Multiuser Massive MIMO Transmission With Downlink Training and Pilot Contamination Precoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7234921","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234921/","displayDocTitle":"Multicell Multiuser Massive MIMO Transmission With Downlink Training and Pilot Contamination Precoding","volume":"65","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210018","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7234921/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61171080"},{"fundingName":"Singapore A*STAR SERC Project","grantNumber":"142 02 00043"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China","grantNumber":"15KJB510025"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicell Multiuser Massive MIMO Transmission With Downlink Training and Pilot Contamination Precoding","sourcePdf":"tvt-zuo-2475284-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16854S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7234921","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7234927,"authors":[{"name":"Qinmin Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Institute of Industrial Process Control, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7330076/7234927/yang-2470175-small.gif","p":["Qinmin Yang received the bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from the Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China, in 2001, the M.Sc. degree in control science and engineering from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA, in 2007.","He was a Post-Doctoral Research Associate with the Missouri University of Science and Technology from 2007 to 2008.

First, the control law consisting of the robust integral of a neural network (NN) output plus sign of the tracking error feedback multiplied with an adaptive gain is introduced. The NN in the control law learns the system dynamics in an online manner, while the NN residual reconstruction errors and the bounded disturbances are overcome by the error sign signal. Since both of the NN output and the error sign signal are included in the integral, the continuity of the control input is ensured. The controller structure and the NN weight update law are novel in contrast with the previous effort, and the semiglobal asymptotic tracking performance is still guaranteed by using the Lyapunov analysis. In addition, the NN weights and all other signals are proved to be bounded simultaneously. The proposed approach also relaxes the need for the upper bounds of certain terms, which are usually required in the previous designs. Finally, the theoretical results are substantiated with simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2470175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7330076/07234927.pdf","startPage":"3278","endPage":"3286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2470175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Integral of Neural Network and Error Sign Control of MIMO Nonlinear Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7234927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234927/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Integral of Neural Network and Error Sign Control of MIMO Nonlinear Systems","volume":"26","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602383","pubMedId":"26340791","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7234927/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2012AA041709 and 2012AA062201"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB720500"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS 1128281"},{"fundingName":"Intelligent Systems Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Integral of Neural Network and Error Sign Control of MIMO Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tnnls-yang-2470175-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.186394S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7330076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7330076","articleId":"7234927","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7234933,"authors":[{"name":"Georgia Tseliou","affiliation":["Open University of Catalonia, Castelldefels, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7234933/tseli-2475641-small.gif","p":["\n\nGeorgia Tseliou (S'13) received the M.Sc. degree in computer engineering \nfrom Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, University of Patras, Greece, in 2012.

Toward this direction, radio access network (RAN) virtualization aims at providing solutions of mapping virtual network elements onto radio resources of the existing physical network. This paper proposes the Resources nEgotiation for NEtwork Virtualization (RENEV) algorithm, which is suitable for application in heterogeneous networks in Long-Term Evolution Advanced (LTE-A) environments, consisting of a macro evolved Node B overlaid with small cells (SCs). By exploiting radio resource management principles, RENEV achieves slicing and on-demand delivery of resources. Leveraging the multitenancy approach, radio resources are transferred in terms of physical radio resource blocks among multiple heterogeneous base stations, which are interconnected via the X2 interface. The main target is to deal with traffic variations in geographical dimension. All signaling design considerations under the current Third-Generation Partnership Project LTE-A architecture are also investigated. Analytical studies and simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate RENEV in terms of the network's throughput and additional signaling overhead. Moreover, we show that RENEV can be applied independently on top of already proposed schemes for RAN virtualization to improve their performance. The results indicate that significant advantages are achieved both from the network's and users' perspective and that it is a scalable solution for different numbers of SCs.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2475641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","startPage":"6651","endPage":"6664","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07234933.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2475641","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalable RAN Virtualization in Multitenant LTE-A Heterogeneous Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtualization","Resource management","Proposals","Quality of service","Baseband","Dynamic scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","cellular radio","Long Term Evolution","quality of service","radio access networks","radio spectrum management","telecommunication signalling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-demand resource delivery","resource slicing","physical radio resource blocks","multiple heterogeneous base stations","X2 interface","traffic variations","signaling design","Third-Generation Partnership Project LTE-A architecture","network throughput","signaling overhead","performance improvement","3GPP architecture","radio resource management principles","small cells","macro evolved Node B","Long-Term Evolution Advanced environments","RENEV algorithm","resources negotiation for network virtualization algorithm","physical network","virtual network elements","radio access network virtualization","data rates","quality of service","cellular communications","multitenant LTE-A heterogeneous networks","scalable RAN virtualization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous networks (HetNets)","long-term evolution advanced (LTE-A)","multitenancy","radio resource management (RRM)","radio access network (RAN) virtualization","small cells (SCs)","X2 interface"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Scalable RAN Virtualization in Multitenant LTE-A Heterogeneous Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234933/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7234933/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16210030","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Multi-Partner Initial Training Network Project CROSSFIRE","grantNumber":"PITN-GA-2012-317126"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003030","fundingName":"Ag\u00e8ncia de Gesti\u00f3 d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca","grantNumber":"2014SGR 1551"},{"fundingName":"CellFive Research Projects","grantNumber":"TEC2014-60130-P"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable RAN Virtualization in Multitenant LTE-A Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-tseliou-2475641-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111915S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7234933","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7234942,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Han Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7234942/yyang-2475427-small.gif","p":["Yu-Han Yang (S\u201906) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering, two M.S. degrees in computer science and communication engineering, from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, in 2004, 2007, and 2013, respectively.

Based on the data analysis, we formulate a wireless access network association game as a multidimensional Markov decision process with negative network externality, where the best response strategy is an approximate Nash equilibrium. A modified value iteration algorithm is proposed to search the best response strategy profile. Applying the proposed algorithm to the data-driven stochastic model, the best response strategy is shown to achieve a better individual expected utility while satisfying the individual rationality, and attain a near-optimal social welfare performance compared to other strategies such as the centralized method and the greedy algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2475427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2475427","startPage":"512","endPage":"524","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07234942.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Network Association Game With Data-Driven Statistical Modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Network Association Game With Data-Driven Statistical Modeling","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7234942/","accessionNumber":"15697430","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234942/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Network Association Game With Data-Driven Statistical Modeling","sourcePdf":"twc-yang-2475427-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093836S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7234942","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7234950,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzheng Ding","affiliation":["South China Normal University, Institute of Laser Life Science, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7287831/7234950/7234950-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenzheng Ding received the B.S. degree from the School of Physics and Optoelectronic Engineering, Yangtze University, Hubei Province, China, in 2011, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degee at the MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.","His research interest is physical mechanisms of new functional imaging."]},"firstName":"Wenzheng","lastName":"Ding","id":"37085734031"},{"name":"Zhong Ji","affiliation":["South China Normal University, Institute of Laser Life Science, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7287831/7234950/7234950-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Zhong Ji received the B.S. degree from the College of Precision Instruments and Optoelectronic Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin City, China, in 2010, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.","His research interests are thermoacoustic/photoacoustic imaging and the new microwave detection method."]},"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Ji","id":"37085726099"},{"name":"Fanghao Ye","affiliation":["South China Normal University, Institute of Laser Life Science, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7287831/7234950/7234950-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Fanghao Ye received the B.S. degree from the College of Physical Science and Technology, Jianghan University, Hubei Province, China in 2013, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.","His research interest is new noninvasive functional imaging in biomedicine."]},"firstName":"Fanghao","lastName":"Ye","id":"37085734144"},{"name":"Cunguang Lou","affiliation":["South China Normal University, Institute of Laser Life Science, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7287831/7234950/7234950-photo-4-source-small.gif","p":["Cunguang Lou received the Ph.D. degree from the South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China, in 2012.","From 2012 to 2014, he was a Lecturer with the College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University.

The sensor continuously captures images for smart sensing, such as face detection, eye tracking, and gesture recognition, and it provides high-resolution images for capturing pictures with a unified sensor. The sensor employs a switchable dual mode: always-on (AO) mode with low power consumption and photo-shooting (PS) mode with high signal-to-noise ratio. For dual-mode operation with high energy efficiency, we implemented dynamic voltage scaling that provides 0.9 V analog-digital supply voltage for the AO mode and 3.3 V analog-1.8 V digital supply voltage for the PS mode. For low-voltage operation in the AO mode, a conventional four-transistor pixel operates as a charge-shared pixel. In order to suppress power consumption and frequency in conventional single-slope analog-to-digital converters (ADC), two neighboring column-parallel ADCs are reconfigured to one successive-approximation ADC for low-voltage and low-frequency operation in the AO mode with negligible area overhead. The fabricated 640 \u00d7 480 pixel prototype sensor operates at 45.5 \u03bcW (at 15 fps, 320 \u00d7 240) in the AO mode, which significantly extends battery life when performing always-on sensing.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2015.2470526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7368951/07234956.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2015.2470526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7368951","startPage":"130","endPage":"140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Always-On CMOS Image Sensor for Mobile and Wearable Devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7234956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Always-On CMOS Image Sensor for Mobile and Wearable Devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7234956/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15685066","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7234956/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Always-On CMOS Image Sensor for Mobile and Wearable Devices","sourcePdf":"jssc-choi-2470526-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088876S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7368951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7368951","articleId":"7234956","onlineDate":"01 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7235065,"authors":[{"name":"Santosh Kumar Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Santosh Kumar","lastName":"Singh","id":"38631971600"},{"name":"S.

These vehicles emit toxic gases, which results in environmental pollution and create massive health problem. For energy security and greener tomorrow, the concept of hybrid vehicle came into existence. Hybrid vehicles consist of alternative energy storages like fuel-cell, super capacitor, battery or hybrid storage. The presence of two power sources, i.e., engine and battery, makes it necessary to intelligently split the power between them to minimize the fuel consumption. An intelligent controller should be used to split the on road power demand for optimum fuel economy. This article applies a genetic algorithm based controller to toggle between engine and battery. The optimization is based on the selection of vital parameters such as state of charge in the battery, engine on time and power demand. The authenticity and feasibility of proposed controller are verified extensively through numerous simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/EnergyEconomics.2015.7235069","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194239/7235053/07235069.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Energy Economics and Environment (ICEEE)","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Energy Economics and Environment (ICEEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EnergyEconomics.2015.7235069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7235053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal fuel control of series-parallel input split hybrid electric vehicle using genetic algorithm based control strategy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7235069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal fuel control of series-parallel input split hybrid electric vehicle using genetic algorithm based control strategy","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15418343","publicationDate":"March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7235069/","conferenceDate":"27-28 March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal fuel control of series-parallel input split hybrid electric vehicle using genetic algorithm based control strategy","confLoc":"Greater Noida, India","sourcePdf":"023235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079991S","chronDate":"27-28 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194239","isNumber":"7235053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194239","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7235053","articleId":"7235069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7235070,"authors":[{"name":"Om Prakash Mahela","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur, India"],"firstName":"Om Prakash","lastName":"Mahela","id":"37085350360"},{"name":"Abdul Gafoor Shaik","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur, India"],"firstName":"Abdul Gafoor","lastName":"Shaik","id":"37085661978"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7492-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7491-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7490-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7235070","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":450},"abstract":"This paper presents a technique for the detection and localization of the power quality events associated with outage and grid synchronization of solar photovoltaic plant in distribution network.

In this paper, Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Short Term Load Forecasting (STLF) model, i.e., ELMAN Neural Network (ELMNN) is developed and tested on NSW Australia data. The performance of the ELMNN-based model is compared with Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN).

To attain the maximum image quality, reliability, and spectrum efficiency in this medium, combined source and channel coding is proposed. Progressive or \u201cmultiresolution\u201d source coding, together with a new form of spread-spectrum code-division multiplex (SS-CDM) channel coding, is used. The coded image information is divided into a large number of parallel data streams, each of which is spread to full channel bandwidth and becomes a component in the CDM multiplexing scheme. Each has a different priority and therefore a different carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR). In this article, CNR is reserved for channel conditions and SNR for signal-to-noise ratio of recovered signal The resulting signal occupies one standard 6-MHz channel and is expected to have excellent interference performance.

Such arrangement results in improved efficiency and higher energy density compared to conventional active decoupling solutions. A control scheme is proposed to exploit the small remaining bus ripple to compensate the power loss in the buffer converter and balance the power cycle of the architecture.

The converter presented herein can potentially be used in applications such as wireless power transfer, fuel cell and battery applications, bus converters, etc.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPEL.2015.7236440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7236433","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics (COMPEL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics (COMPEL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219822/7236433/07236440.pdf","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"27.12MHz GaN Bi-directional resonant power converter","doi":"10.1109/COMPEL.2015.7236440","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7236440","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"27.12MHz GaN Bi-directional resonant power converter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236440/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15432094","publicationDate":"July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7236440/","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"27.12MHz GaN Bi-directional resonant power converter","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"compel2015final105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068879S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219822","isNumber":"7236433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219822","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7236433","articleId":"7236440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7236441,"authors":[{"name":"Mohit Sinha","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Minnesota"],"firstName":"Mohit","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37085459868"},{"name":"Sairaj Dhople","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Minnesota"],"firstName":"Sairaj","lastName":"Dhople","id":"37391590300"},{"name":"Brian Johnson","affiliation":["Power Systems Engineering Center, National Renewable Energy Laboratory"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Johnson","id":"37085456451"},{"name":"Nathan Ainsworth","affiliation":["Power Systems Engineering Center, National Renewable Energy Laboratory"],"firstName":"Nathan","lastName":"Ainsworth","id":"37887876500"},{"name":"Florian D\u00f6rfler","affiliation":["ETH, Automatic Control Laboratory, Z\u00fcrich"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"D\u00f6rfler","id":"37545454200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6847-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6846-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-5142"}],"articleNumber":"7236441","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":579},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Oscillators","Synchronization","Voltage control","Reactive power","Switches","Frequency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM invertors","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear supersets","droop control","virtual oscillator control","time-domain control method","islanded inverters","weakly nonlinear limit-cycle oscillators","coordinate transformation","PWM switching signals","oscillator dynamic states","inverter terminal-voltage amplitude","parametric linear combination","reactive power","time-domain performance","parallel connected inverters","virtual-oscillator-controlled inverter"]}],"abstract":"This paper offers a suite of extensions to Virtual Oscillator Control - a time-domain control method for islanded inverters whereby they are controlled to emulate the dynamics of weakly nonlinear limit-cycle oscillators.

Additionally, we compare the time-domain performance of VOC to droop control for parallel connected inverters in two cases: synchronization from a cold start and inverter addition.

As examples, flying capacitor multilevel converters (FCMC) and hybrid switched-capacitor (SC) converters are compared to conventional two-level buck converters, and are shown analytically to have significantly reduced passive component size. Three converter prototypes are implemented, based on the presented methodology to experimentally validate the method as well as demonstrate the advantages of multilevel converters.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Capacitors","Inductors","Inductance","Switching loss","Topology","Switching frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","switched capacitor networks","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid switched-capacitor converters","FCMC","flying capacitor multilevel converters","passive component volume","switching loss","conduction loss","multilevel topologies","voltage conversion ratio","dc-dc applications","multilevel conversion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/COMPEL.2015.7236448","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics (COMPEL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics (COMPEL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219822/7236433/07236448.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7236433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPEL.2015.7236448","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analytical method to evaluate flying capacitor multilevel converters and hybrid switched-capacitor converters for large voltage conversion ratios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7236448","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An analytical method to evaluate flying capacitor multilevel converters and hybrid switched-capacitor converters for large voltage conversion ratios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236448/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7236448/","accessionNumber":"15432107","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analytical method to evaluate flying capacitor multilevel converters and hybrid switched-capacitor converters for large voltage conversion ratios","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"compel2015final114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056263S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219822","isNumber":"7236433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219822","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7236433","articleId":"7236448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7236460,"authors":[{"name":"Tuomas Messo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Tuomas","lastName":"Messo","id":"38234373700"},{"name":"Aapo Aapro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Aapo","lastName":"Aapro","id":"37085392743"},{"name":"Teuvo Suntio","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Teuvo","lastName":"Suntio","id":"37275782900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6847-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6846-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-5142"}],"articleNumber":"7236460","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":894},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Stability analysis","Admittance","Power system stability","Impedance","Voltage control","Phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","MIMO systems","phase locked loops","power factor","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multivariable small-signal model","three-phase grid-connected inverter","DQ-domain","renewable energy inverter","arbitrary power factor","DC-voltage control","AC-current control","phase-locked-loop","cross-coupling admittance","multiple-input multiple-output","MIMO","admittance matrix","small-signal stability","finite grid impedance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7236460","doi":"10.1109/COMPEL.2015.7236460","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics (COMPEL)","abstract":"This paper proposes a multivariable small-signal model of a three-phase grid-connected renewable energy inverter in dq-domain.

However, an LCL-filter has an inherent resonance which has to be damped by a passive or active method to avoid instability. This paper presents an accurate small-signal model of the three-phase VSI-based photovoltaic inverter with LCL-type output filter using transfer matrices. Additionally, the effect of active damping on the output impedance is analyzed. The developed small-signal model has been verified by extracting frequency responses from a simulation model and a scaled-down prototype inverter. The model is shown to accurately predict the shape of inverter transfer functions such as the output impedance. Furthermore, it allows deterministic control design and accurate tuning of the active damper as well as performance evaluation of the control system.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Inverters","Resonant frequency","Impedance","Resistors","Transfer functions","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","invertors","photovoltaic power systems","power conversion harmonics","power harmonic filters","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase photovoltaic inverter","small signal model","three phase voltage source inverter","LCL-type output filter","transfer matrices","output impedance active damping","inverter transfer functions","control system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/COMPEL.2015.7236463","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics (COMPEL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics (COMPEL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219822/7236433/07236463.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7236433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPEL.2015.7236463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of active damping on the output impedance of PV inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7236463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Effect of active damping on the output impedance of PV inverter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236463/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7236463/","accessionNumber":"15432097","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of active damping on the output impedance of PV inverter","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"compel2015final144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096731S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219822","isNumber":"7236433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219822","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7236433","articleId":"7236463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7236473,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Scandola","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy","Infineon Technologies Italia S.r.l., Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Scandola","id":"37085471598"},{"name":"Luca Corradini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Corradini","id":"37300711900"},{"name":"Giorgio Spiazzi","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Spiazzi","id":"37275791100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6847-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6846-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-5142"}],"articleNumber":"7236473","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":269},"abstract":"Multi-variable digital controllers exploiting a combination of phase shift and pulse width modulation (PSM+PWM) have recently been investigated as methods for simultaneously achieving output voltage regulation and efficiency optimization in dc-dc Series Resonant Converters.

The study extends known results for uniformly sampled pulse width and phase shift modulators, illustrating the effects of sampling delays on the modulator output dynamics. Furthermore, results indicate that, in general, PWM and PSM individually induce both amplitude and phase modulation in the converter phasor dynamics.

In this work, we explore flying-capacitor multi-level (FCML) DC-DC topologies as a class of hybrid switched-capacitor/inductive converter.

It is shown that multimode operation, including previously published resonant and dynamic off-time modulation, form a single set of techniques that can be used to extend high efficiency over a wide power density range. Some of the general operating considerations of FCML converters, such as the challenge of maintaining voltage balance on flying capacitors, are shown to be of equal concern in other soft-switched SC converter topologies. Experimental verification from a 24V:12V, 3-level converter is presented to show multimode operation with a nominally 2:1 topology. A second 50V:7V 4-level FCML converter demonstrates operation with variable regulation. A method is presented to balance flying capacitor voltages through low frequency closed-loop feedback.","doi":"10.1109/COMPEL.2015.7236511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPEL.2015.7236511","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics (COMPEL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219822/7236433/07236511.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics (COMPEL)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7236433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resonant and multi-mode operation of flying capacitor multi-level DC-DC converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Resonant and multi-mode operation of flying capacitor multi-level DC-DC converters","conferenceDate":"12-15 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7236511/","accessionNumber":"15432096","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236511/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resonant and multi-mode operation of flying capacitor multi-level DC-DC converters","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"compel2015final81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053511S","chronDate":"12-15 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219822","isNumber":"7236433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219822","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7236433","articleId":"7236511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":7236513,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Amin","affiliation":["Dept. of Engineering Cybernetics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Amin","id":"37085395466"},{"name":"Marta Molinas","affiliation":["Dept. of Engineering Cybernetics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Molinas","id":"37352948200"},{"name":"Jing Lyu","affiliation":["Dept. of Engineering Cybernetics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Lyu","id":"37085644313"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6847-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6846-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1093-5142"}],"articleNumber":"7236513","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":835},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["HVDC transmission","Voltage control","Impedance","Damping","Voltage measurement","Reactive power","Wind farms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVDC power convertors","HVDC power transmission","offshore installations","oscillations","power system harmonics","power transmission control","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sub-synchronous oscillation","SSO","harmonic resonance","wind energy conversion system converter controller","WECS converter controller","HVDC converter controller","system impedance","full-scale converter","electrical network","voltage source converter-based high voltage dc transmission system","VSC-based HVDC transmission system","ac collection bus side HVDC converter","WECS full converter DC link","dc link dynamics","active damping scheme","offshore HVDC system","time domain simulation results","spectral analysis","frequency 15 Hz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Harmonic Resonance","Sub-synchronous Oscillation","active damping","Offshore grid","HVDC","Wind farm","Converter Control"]}],"abstract":"Field experience has shown that sub-synchronous oscillation (SSO) and harmonic resonance can happen due to the interaction of wind energy conversion system's (WECS) converter controller, HVDC converter controller and impact of system impedance.

Therefore 2.5D or 3D package has developed rapidly. The structure of 2.5D package is simply compared with 3Dpackage, so it is easy to apply in products in a short time. As a result, 2.5D package has become a popular way to make the package small, light and multi-functional. This paper focuses on a method to design imitation chip based on 2.5D package. Due to the structure of Virtex-7 which has been researching, it is necessary to design an imitation chip to apply in verifying the encapsulation technology of 2.5D package. This method is beneficial to shorten the design period and save the cost of production. Furthermore, it is in favor of studying 2.5D package deeply.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 16th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7222824/7236526/07236557.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"124","publicationTitle":"2015 16th International Conference on Electronic Packaging Technology (ICEPT)","doi":"10.1109/ICEPT.2015.7236557","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEPT.2015.7236557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7236526","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7236557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Imitation chip design based on TSV 2.5D package","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Microelectronics","Encapsulation","Market research","Three-dimensional displays","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit packaging","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["imitation chip design","TSV 2.5D package","microelectronic package","Virtex-7","encapsulation technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TSV","2.5D package","Imitation chip","RDL"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Imitation chip design based on TSV 2.5D package","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7236557/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15432289","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"11-14 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Imitation chip design based on TSV 2.5D package","confLoc":"Changsha, China","sourcePdf":"Paper031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040963S","chronDate":"11-14 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7222824","isNumber":"7236526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7222824","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7236526","articleId":"7236557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7236869,"authors":[{"name":"Nikos Kargas","affiliation":["Telecom Laboratory, School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikos","lastName":"Kargas","id":"37085587425"},{"name":"Fanis Mavromatis","affiliation":["Electrical & Electronic Engineering Department, Democritus University of Thrace, Xanthi, Greece"],"firstName":"Fanis","lastName":"Mavromatis","id":"37542760800"},{"name":"Aggelos Bletsas","affiliation":["Telecom Laboratory, School of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Chania, Greece"],"firstName":"Aggelos","lastName":"Bletsas","id":"37295046900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7236869","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1457},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Encoding","Transceivers","Software","RFID tags"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio transceivers","radiofrequency identification","software radio","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully-coherent reader","SDR","Gen2 FM0","RFID","radio frequency identification","battery-less sensors","piggyback sensed information","software-defined radio reader","transceiver card","battery-less sensor networks"]},{"kwd":["Radiofrequency identification","software radio","detection algorithms"]}],"abstract":"There has been a continuously growing interest in radio frequency identification (RFID) and more recently, in computational RFID, i.e. battery-less sensors that piggyback sensed information, rather than a constant ID bit stream, utilizing Gen2, the physical layer of commercial RFID systems.

Traditional D2D schemes mainly focus on maximizing the system throughput without taking into account the quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning. To overcome this problem, we develop a framework to investigate the impact of delay-QoS requirement on the performance of D2D and cellular communications in underlaying wireless networks. Then, we propose the optimal power allocation schemes with statistical QoS provisioning for the following two channel modes: 1). co-channel mode based underlaying wireless networks where D2D devices and cellular devices share the same frequency-time resource; 2). orthogonal-channel mode based underlaying wireless networks where the frequency-time resource is partitioned into two parts for D2D devices and cellular devices, respectively. Applying our proposed optimal power allocations into D2D based underlaying wireless networks, we obtain the maximum network throughput subject to a given delay-QoS constraint for above-mentioned two underlaying wireless network modes, respectively. Also conducted is a set of numerical and simulation results to evaluate our proposed QoS-driven power allocation schemes under different delay-QoS requirements.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2476075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7358196/07236879.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2476075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7358196","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation With Statistical QoS Provisioning for D2D and Cellular Communications Over Underlaying Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236879/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation With Statistical QoS Provisioning for D2D and Cellular Communications Over Underlaying Wireless Networks","volume":"34","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15663075","htmlLink":"/document/7236879/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1408601 and CNS-1205726"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401330 and 61301169"},{"fundingName":"111 Project of China","grantNumber":"B08038"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"7214603701"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Allocation With Statistical QoS Provisioning for D2D and Cellular Communications Over Underlaying Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-zhang-2476075-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08332S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7358196","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7358196","articleId":"7236879","onlineDate":"02 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7236883,"authors":[{"name":"Eli Christopher I.

Performance anomalies caused by application bugs, hardware or software faults, or resource contention can have great impact on system-wide performance and could lead to significant economic losses for service providers. While many detection methods have been presented in the past, the newly emerging challenges are detection scalability and practical use. In this paper, we propose a scalable, non-parametric method for effectively detecting performance anomalies in large-scale systems. The design is generic for anomaly detection in a variety of parallel and distributed systems exhibiting peer-comparable property. It adopts a divide-and-conquer approach to address the scalability challenge and explores the use of non-parametric clustering and two-phase majority voting to improve detection flexibility and accuracy. We derive probabilistic models to quantitatively evaluate our decentralized design. Experiments with a suite of applications on production systems demonstrate that this method outperforms existing methods in terms of detection accuracy with a negligible runtime overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2015.2475741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7488924/07236888.pdf","startPage":"1902","endPage":"1914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2015.2475741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7488924","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable, Non-Parametric Method for Detecting Performance Anomaly in Large Scale Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7236888","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236888/","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable, Non-Parametric Method for Detecting Performance Anomaly in Large Scale Computing","volume":"27","issue":"7","publicationDate":"1 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16070212","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7236888/","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1422009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable, Non-Parametric Method for Detecting Performance Anomaly in Large Scale Computing","sourcePdf":"tpds-yu-2475741-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125117S","chronDate":"July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7488924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7488924","articleId":"7236888","onlineDate":"02 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7236896,"authors":[{"name":"Andrei Stoian","affiliation":["Centre d\u2019Etude et De Recherche en Informatique et Communications, Conservatoire National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7580586/7236896/stoia-2475835-small.gif","p":["Andrei Stoian (S\u201913) received the Computer Engineering degree from the Politehnica University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania, and the M.Sc. degree in image processing from the University of Bordeaux, Talence, France.

Our aim is to support retrieval from such archives using queries based on the example video clips that contain meaningful human actions. We propose a solution for the scalable search of actions in large-scale archives by leveraging the complementarity between the description at the frame level and the aggregation in time of descriptors. To permit fast search, we introduce a two-level cascade. The inexpensive first level employs aggregation to filter out a large part of the video. At the second level, aided by feature selection, a more discriminative comparison by frame alignment ranks the remaining video sequences. We improve upon the state of the art on popular data sets, and we introduce and show the results on a novel video archive data set that is significantly larger than previous ones.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236896/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16354936","volume":"26","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7236896/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast Action Localization in Large-Scale Video Archives","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"French National Research Agency within the Joint French-Mexican Project Mex-Culture","grantNumber":"ANR-11-IS02-001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Action Localization in Large-Scale Video Archives","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-stoian-2475835-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082135S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7580586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7580586","articleId":"7236896","onlineDate":"02 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7236899,"authors":[{"name":"Tran Viet Xuan Phuong","affiliation":["Centre for Computer and Information Security Research, School of Computing and Information Technology, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7313073/7236899/phuon-2475723-small.gif","p":["Tran Viet Xuan Phuong received the bachelor\u2019s degree from the Vietnam National University of Science, in 2010, and the M.S. degree from the Japan Advanced Institute of Science Technology, in 2012.

In the first scheme, we present a new technique that uses only one group element to represent an attribute, while the existing ABE schemes of the same type need to use three different group elements to represent an attribute for the three possible values (namely, positive, negative, and wildcard). Our new technique leads to a new CP-ABE scheme with constant ciphertext size, which, however, cannot hide the access policy used for encryption. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new CP-ABE scheme with the property of hidden access policy by extending the technique we used in the construction of our first scheme. In particular, we show a way to bridge ABE based on AND-gate with wildcard with inner product encryption and then use the latter to achieve the goal of hidden access policy. We prove that our second scheme is secure under the standard decisional linear and decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumptions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryption Under Standard Assumptions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2475723","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7313073/07236899.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2475723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7313073","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7236899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryption Under Standard Assumptions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7236899/","dateOfInsertion":"30 October 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15568292","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Encryption Under Standard Assumptions","sourcePdf":"tifs-tran-2475723-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08727S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7313073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7313073","articleId":"7236899","onlineDate":"02 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7236903,"authors":[{"name":"MD.

However, PUF stability with respect to temporal variations still limits its utility and widespread acceptance. Previous techniques in the literature have focused on improving PUF robustness against voltage and temperature variations, but the issues associated with aging have been largely neglected. In this paper, we address aging in the popular ring oscillator (RO)-PUF. We propose a new aging-resistant design that reduces sensitivity to negative-bias temperature instability and hot-carrier injection stresses. Simulation results demonstrate that our aging-resistant RO-PUF (ARO-PUF) can produce unique, random, and more reliable keys. On an average, only 3.8% bits of an ARO-PUF flip over a ten-year operational period because of aging, compared with a 12.8% bit flip for a conventional RO-PUF. The proposed ARO-PUF allows us to eliminate the need for error correction by adding extra ROs. The result shows that an ARO-PUF saves \n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">~</sub>\n32x area overhead compared with a conventional RO-PUF with required error correction schemes for a reliable key.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2015.2474741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7558276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2015.2474741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/7558276/07236903.pdf","startPage":"335","endPage":"348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Aging-Resistant RO-PUF for Reliable Key Generation","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/6245516/7558276/7236903-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Aging-Resistant RO-PUF for Reliable Key Generation","volume":"4","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Sept.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7236903/","publicationDate":"July-Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16282795","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236903/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS 1441750"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation","grantNumber":"2557"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research","grantNumber":"FA9550-14-1-0351"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"An Aging-Resistant RO-PUF for Reliable Key Generation","sourcePdf":"tetc-rahman-2474741-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133283S","chronDate":"July-Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"7558276","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7558276","articleId":"7236903","onlineDate":"02 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7236905,"authors":[{"name":"Xingsi Xue","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Fujian University of Technology, Fuzhou, Fujian, China","School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xian, Shaanxi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/7377158/7236905/xue-small.gif","p":["Xingsi Xue received the PhD degree in computer applications from the\n School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, China, in 2014.

The optical front-end achieves low power consumption by using inverter-based amplifiers and realizes sufficient bandwidth by applying several bandwidth extension techniques. In addition, in order to minimize additional jitter at the front-end, not only magnitude and bandwidth but also group-delay responses are considered. The AD-CDR employs an LC quadrature digitally controlled oscillator (LC-QDCO) to achieve a high phase noise figure-of-merit at tens of gigahertz.

This paper focuses on the trust computing requirement of multi-cloud collaborative services and develops a Data-driven and Feedback-Enhanced Trust (DFET) computing pattern across multiple data centers with several innovative mechanisms. First, a trust-aware service monitoring architecture is proposed based on distributed soft agents to serve as middleware for multi-cloud trust computing and task scheduling. A data-driven trust computation scheme based on multi-indicator monitoring data is then proposed. The integration of several key service indicators into trust computing makes this scheme suitable for service-oriented cloud applications. More importantly, according to the intrinsic relationship among users, monitors, and service providers, we propose an enhanced and hierarchical feedback mechanism that can effectively reduce networking risk while improving system dependability. Theoretical analysis shows that DFET pattern is highly dependable against garnished and bad-mouthing attacks. We also build a prototype system to verify the feasibility of DFET pattern and the experiments yield meaningful observations that can facilitate the effective utilization of DFET in the large-scale multi-cloud collaborative environment.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8425801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2015.2475743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/8425801/07236926.pdf","startPage":"671","endPage":"684","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2015.2475743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven and Feedback-Enhanced Trust Computing Pattern for Large-Scale Multi-Cloud Collaborative Services","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug. 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven and Feedback-Enhanced Trust Computing Pattern for Large-Scale Multi-Cloud Collaborative Services","volume":"11","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7236926/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 July-Aug. 2018","accessionNumber":"17974374","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2018","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370069, 61332005 and 61472316"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100010261","fundingName":"Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation","grantNumber":"132032"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0794"},{"fundingName":"Funds for Creative Research Groups of China","grantNumber":"61421061"},{"fundingName":"Cosponsored Project of Beijing Committee of Education"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven and Feedback-Enhanced Trust Computing Pattern for Large-Scale Multi-Cloud Collaborative Services","sourcePdf":"tsc-li-2475743-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107769S","chronDate":"July-Aug. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"4629386","isNumber":"8425801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4629386","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8425801","articleId":"7236926","onlineDate":"02 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7236927,"authors":[{"name":"Zaka Ullah Zahid","affiliation":["Future Energy Electronics Center, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6687316/7299736/7236927/zahid-2476035-small.gif","p":["Zaka Ullah Zahid (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from NWFP University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Peshawar, Pakistan, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from George Washington University (GWU), Washington, DC, USA, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

This converter is similar to an LLC-type resonant converter with an extra inductor and capacitor in the secondary side. Soft-switching can be ensured in all switches without additional snubber or clamp circuitry. Because of soft-switching in all switches, very high-frequency operation is possible; thus, the size of the magnetics and the filter capacitors can be made small. To reduce the size and cost of the converter, a CLLC-type resonant network is derived from the original CLLLC-type resonant network. First, in this paper, an equivalent model for the bidirectional converter is derived for the steady-state analysis. Then, the design methodology is presented for the CLLLC-type resonant converter. Design of this converter includes determining the transformer turns ratio, design of the magnetizing inductance based on zero-voltage switching condition, design of the resonant inductances and capacitances. Then, the CLLCtype resonant network is derived from the CLLLC-type resonant network. To validate the design procedure, a 3.5-kW converter was designed following the guidelines in the proposed methodology. A prototype was built and tested in the laboratory. Experimental results verified the design procedure presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236927/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","volume":"1","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15552446","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7236927/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of Bidirectional DC\u2013DC Resonant Converter for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Bidirectional DC\u2013DC Resonant Converter for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) Applications","sourcePdf":"tte-zahid-2476035-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132211S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687316","isNumber":"7299736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687316","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"7299736","articleId":"7236927","onlineDate":"02 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7236928,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiguo Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA","School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, Lancaster, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7236928/zding-2475758-small.gif","p":["Zhiguo Ding (S\u201903\u2013M\u201905) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D degree in electrical engineering from Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2000 and 2005, respectively.

For the special case of m = 1, the addressed scheduling problem is equivalent to relay selection for the scenario with one SD pair and M relays. In conventional cooperative networks, the max-min selection criterion has been recognized as a diversity-optimal strategy for relay selection and user scheduling. The main contribution of this paper is to show that the use of the max-min criterion will result in loss of diversity gains in energy harvesting cooperative networks. Particularly, when only a single user is scheduled, analytical results are developed to demonstrate that the diversity gain achieved by the max-min criterion is only M+1/2 , much less than the maximal diversity gain M. This finding is important since it illustrates that the use of energy harvesting brings fundamental changes to the design of cooperative networks. Motivated by the loss of the max-min criterion, several user scheduling approaches tailored to energy harvesting networks are developed and their performance is analyzed. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the accuracy of the developed analytical results and facilitate the performance comparison.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Energy harvesting","Diversity methods","Cooperative systems","Wireless communication","Resource management","Scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","diversity reception","inductive power transmission","minimax techniques","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general energy harvesting cooperative network","source-destination pairs","user pairs","relay selection","max-min selection criterion","diversity-optimal strategy","user scheduling","diversity gains","maximal diversity gain"]},{"kwd":["Max-min relay selection","relay selection","SWIPT","user scheduling","wireless power transfer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2475758","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07236928.pdf","startPage":"553","endPage":"567","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2475758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-User SWIPT Cooperative Networks: Is the Max\u2013Min Criterion Still Diversity-Optimal?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7236928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-User SWIPT Cooperative Networks: Is the Max\u2013Min Criterion Still Diversity-Optimal?","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236928/","volume":"15","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7236928/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15697449","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/L025272/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1456793 and ECCS-1343210"},{"fundingName":"International Conference on Communication Systems"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-User SWIPT Cooperative Networks: Is the Max\u2013Min Criterion Still Diversity-Optimal?","sourcePdf":"twc-ding-2475758-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148383S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7236928","onlineDate":"02 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7236929,"authors":[{"name":"Yuta Yamada","affiliation":["Chiba University, Graduate School of Advanced Integration Science, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/7247780/7236929/7236929-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuta Yamada received the B.E. degree from Chiba University, Chiba, Japan, in 2014.

The validity and effectiveness of the proposed design strategy was confirmed by showing the quantitative agreements between PSpice-simulation and experimental results.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2015.2467071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247780","startPage":"354","endPage":"363","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/7247780/07236929.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a DC-DC Converter With Phase-Controlled Class-D ZVS Inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7236929/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of a DC-DC Converter With Phase-Controlled Class-D ZVS Inverter","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15433150","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a DC-DC Converter With Phase-Controlled Class-D ZVS Inverter","sourcePdf":"jetcas-yamada-2467071-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109929S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"7247780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7247780","articleId":"7236929","onlineDate":"02 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7236930,"authors":[{"name":"Die Hu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of EMW Information, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7236930/diehu-2475745-small.gif","p":["Die Hu (AM\u201910\u2013M\u201911) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.

To mitigate the effect of pilot contamination, we propose a semiblind channel estimation method that does not require cell cooperation or statistical information of the channels. In the proposed method, we first sequentially estimate the UL data from different users in the target cell. To do that, for each user, we solve a constrained minimization problem to obtain an extracting vector and then use it to extract the desired data source from the observed mixture signal. An efficient algorithm is presented to solve the optimization problem. After the ambiguities in the extracted source are corrected with the aid of the pilot sequence, the estimates of the user UL data can be obtained. Based on the demodulated UL data of all users in the target cell, we finally obtain the least squares (LS) estimate of the channel. The pilot contamination effect is shown to be reduced as the UL data length grows. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms some existing channel estimation methods that do not require cell cooperation or channel statistics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236930/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","volume":"15","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15697417","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7236930/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Blind Pilot Decontamination for Massive MIMO Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272267 and 61329101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Blind Pilot Decontamination for Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-wang-2475745-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090151S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7236930","onlineDate":"02 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7236931,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Li","affiliation":["Oregon State University, EECS, Corvallis, Oregon, United States"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7336577/7236931/7236931-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Li (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2009, and the M.S. degree in computer architecture from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2012.

This paper presents a 5 \u00d7 25 Gb/s carrier-depletion microring-based wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) transmitter in 65 nm CMOS. An AC-coupled differential driver is proposed to realize 4 \u00d7 VDD output swing as well as tunable DC-biasing. The proposed transmitter incorporates 2-tap asymmetric pre-emphasis to effectively cancel the optical nonlinearity of the ring modulator. An average-power-based dynamic wavelength stabilization loop is also demonstrated to compensate for thermal induced resonant wavelength drift. At 25 Gb/s operation, each transmitter channel consumes 113.5 mW and maintains 7 dB extinction ratio with a 4.4 V pp-diff output swing in the presence of thermal fluctuations.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2015.2470524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2015.2470524","startPage":"3145","endPage":"3159","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7336577/07236931.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7336577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 25 Gb/s, 4.4 V-Swing, AC-Coupled Ring Modulator-Based WDM Transmitter with Wavelength Stabilization in 65 nm CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7236931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"A 25 Gb/s, 4.4 V-Swing, AC-Coupled Ring Modulator-Based WDM Transmitter with Wavelength Stabilization in 65 nm CMOS","volume":"50","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15618347","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7236931/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007302","fundingName":"HP Labs"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 25 Gb/s, 4.4 V-Swing, AC-Coupled Ring Modulator-Based WDM Transmitter with Wavelength Stabilization in 65 nm CMOS","sourcePdf":"jssc-li-2470524-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085023S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7336577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7336577","articleId":"7236931","onlineDate":"02 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7236937,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Lim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Yongin, Korea","University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7336577/7236937/7236937-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yong Lim (S\u201913) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

We implement a switched-capacitor (SC) inter-stage residue amplifier that uses this new fully differential ring amplifier to give accurate amplification without calibration. In addition, a new floated detect-and-skip (FDAS) capacitive DAC (CDAC) switching method reduces the switching energy and improves linearity of first-stage CDAC.

In most cases the large scale parallelism of the applications uses MPI, widely recognized as the de-facto standard for building parallel applications, while several programming languages are used to express the parallelism available in the application and map it onto the parallel resources available on GPUs. Regular grids and stencil codes are used in a subset of these applications, often corresponding to computational \u201cGrand Challenges\u201d. One such class of applications are Lattice Boltzmann Methods (LB) used in computational fluid dynamics. The regular structure of LB algorithms makes them suitable for processor architectures with a large degree of parallelism like GPUs. Scalability of these applications on large clusters requires a careful design of processor-to-processor data communications, exploiting all possibilities to overlap communication and computation. This paper looks at these issues, considering as a use case a state-of-the-art two-dimensional LB model, that accurately reproduces the thermo-hydrodynamics of a 2D-fluid obeying the equation-of-state of a perfect gas.

Coverage and capacity are the most important characteristics of any cellular network. In WCDMA networks, the pilot signal of a cell is used to determine the cell size, hence it can be used to determine the coverage area of the cell. Increasing or reducing the cell pilot power increases or reduces the cell size respectively and hence pilot power can be used to balance load among neighboring cells. As networks continue to evolve, the frequency of optimization and number of tunable parameters continues to increase making manual optimization challenging. This paper presents a practical solution to the pilot power optimization problem in WCDMA networks and addresses the issue of rising optimization complexity by presenting a self-optimization based algorithm for tuning pilot power. When running in closed loop, the algorithm can be used to autonomously optimize pilot power and load balance traffic in the network. When scheduled or triggered manually, the algorithm can also be used to improve network capacity in areas expecting high traffic load during a certain time for example during social gatherings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-optimization of power parameters in WCDMA networks","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","doi":"10.1109/HPCSim.2015.7237024","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7214433/7237005/07237024.pdf","startPage":"80","endPage":"87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCSim.2015.7237024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Self-optimization of power parameters in WCDMA networks","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237024/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15431914","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-optimization of power parameters in WCDMA networks","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"010.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.179807S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7214433","isNumber":"7237005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7214433","xplore-issue":"7237005","articleId":"7237024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237030,"authors":[{"name":"Alex Schoenberger","affiliation":["Integrated Electronic Systems Lab TU Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Schoenberger","id":"37085542502"},{"name":"Klaus Hofmann","affiliation":["Integrated Electronic Systems Lab TU Darmstadt, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Hofmann","id":"37375118300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7813-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7812-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7811-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7237030","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Delays","Three-dimensional displays","Runtime","Decoding","Computer architecture","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","DRAM chips","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetric 3D DRAM architecture","L2 cache size reduction","access time","bandwidth improvement","die-stacking technology","underlying cache","CPU","software components","JPEG2000 algorithm","MIPS I core","picture sizes","last-level cache size","3D DRAM architecture","cache functionality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D DRAM","L2 Cache","locality principle","JPEG2000"]}],"abstract":"Memory is a heterogeneous complex in modern systems. Access time and bandwidth improvement of DRAM using die-stacking technology can only be evaluated by interacting with hardware components like underlying cache, CPU and software components like executed application and processed input. In this work we analyze encoding and decoding processes of JPEG2000 algorithm execution on MIPS I core for different picture sizes. Thereby we can observe that for picture sizes below particular critical value the DRAM share of execution time reaches max. 4%. Any DRAM improvement for this case would not lead to significant performance gain of whole system. Starting with particular picture size depending on last-level cache size the acceleration effect of cache falls off and DRAM influence rises up to 25% and remains for larger pictures. System-level estimation shows that our suggested 3D DRAM architecture can reduce that rise down to a third and is partially able to adopt cache functionality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of asymmetric 3D DRAM architecture in combination with L2 cache size reduction","doi":"10.1109/HPCSim.2015.7237030","startPage":"123","endPage":"128","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCSim.2015.7237030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237005","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7214433/7237005/07237030.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237030","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of asymmetric 3D DRAM architecture in combination with L2 cache size reduction","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237030/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15419371","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of asymmetric 3D DRAM architecture in combination with L2 cache size reduction","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"016.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060533S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7214433","isNumber":"7237005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7214433","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7237005","articleId":"7237030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237047,"authors":[{"name":"Omar Khedher","affiliation":["Innov'com Laboratory, E.N.I.T, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Khedher","id":"37085414680"},{"name":"Mohamed Jarraya","affiliation":["College of Computation and Informatics Saudi Electronic University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Jarraya","id":"37085419074"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7813-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7812-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7811-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7237047","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computers","Cloud computing","Scheduling algorithms","Virtual machining","Computational modeling","Blades"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer aided instruction","educational institutions","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VCL cloud computing environment","CloudSim","academic communities","IT infrastructure administration","virtual cloud laboratory","deployment requirements","resource allocation policies","scheduling algorithms","enhanced scheduler"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Virtual Cloud Laboratory","On Demand Resources","Scheduling Algorithm","CloudSim","Performance Analysis"]}],"abstract":"Cloud Computing has empowered the academic communities by reducing the IT infrastructure administration and cost.

In addition, putting the performance of resource allocation policies and different scheduling algorithms under scope could help to quantify the workload running in a real and expanded VCL environment. We aim through this study at identifying the limitations of the default scheduler in VCL and propose an enhanced scheduler.

In a previous work, we proposed a concept that leverages the advantages of FPGA's partial reconfiguration in heterogeneous mixed criticality multicore systems. The basic idea how to handle the partial reconfiguration transparently for noncritical tasks, while providing full control and a predictable behavior for safety relevant tasks was described. In this paper, we focus on the on-demand partial reconfiguration of coprocessors and its implementation details. Our prototype is implemented on an Intel multicore system and a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA connected via PCI Express, taking advantage of the Single-Root I/O Virtualization capabilities in modern PCI Express implementations. Experimental results show that compared to the reference software implementation, our concept achieves significantly shorter reconfiguration time with lower variance under various system load situations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7214433/7237005/07237094.pdf","startPage":"569","endPage":"576","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","doi":"10.1109/HPCSim.2015.7237094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCSim.2015.7237094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237094","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-demand reconfiguration for coprocessors in mixed criticality multicore systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coprocessors","Virtualization","Field programmable gate arrays","Software","Multicore processing","Virtual machining","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","field programmable gate arrays","multiprocessing systems","peripheral interfaces","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed criticality multicore systems","on-demand partial reconfiguration","coprocessors","Intel multicore system","Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA","PCI Express","single-root I/O virtualization capabilities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237094/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"On-demand reconfiguration for coprocessors in mixed criticality multicore systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237094/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15419427","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-demand reconfiguration for coprocessors in mixed criticality multicore systems","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065806S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7214433","isNumber":"7237005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7214433","xplore-issue":"7237005","articleId":"7237094","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237100,"authors":[{"name":"Farnaz Hoseini","affiliation":["Islamic Azad University, Rasht Branch Faculty of Engineering, Rasht, Iran"],"firstName":"Farnaz","lastName":"Hoseini","id":"37085694261"},{"name":"Asadollah Shahbahrami","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran"],"firstName":"Asadollah","lastName":"Shahbahrami","id":"37398211900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7813-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7812-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7811-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7237100","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image edge detection","Image segmentation","TV","Graphics processing units"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","fuzzy reasoning","fuzzy set theory","graphics processing units","mathematics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy edge detection","GPU","MATLAB","image processing","border characteristics","graphics processing unit","image edges","fuzzy inference system","RGB images","grayscale images","membership function","white pixels","data-level parallelism","scatter-gather parallel communication pattern","Matlab environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["edge detection algorithms","GPU","Parallel Computing"]}],"abstract":"Edge detection is one of the most important concepts in image processing which is used as an indicator for processing and extraction of some of border characteristics at low levels, also for detection and finding objects at high levels.

Many-body potentials used for modeling of carbon and metallic nanostructures usually require much more computing resources than pair potentials. One of the ways to improve their performance is to transform them for running on computing systems that combines CPU and GPU. In this work OpenCL performance of basic molecular dynamics algorithms such as neighbor list generation along with different implementations of energy-force computation of Lennard-Jones, Tersoff and EAM potentials is evaluated. It is shown that concurrent memory writes are effective for Tersoff bond order potential and are not good for embedded-atom potential. Performance measurements show a significant GPU acceleration of basic molecular dynamics algorithms over the corresponding serial implementations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7214433/7237005/07237104.pdf","startPage":"629","endPage":"634","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on High Performance Computing & Simulation (HPCS)","doi":"10.1109/HPCSim.2015.7237104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCSim.2015.7237104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237005","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPGPU performance evaluation of some basic molecular dynamics algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Heuristic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Atomic measurements","Computational modeling","Registers","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["molecular dynamics method","parallel processing","physics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPGPU performance evaluation","molecular dynamics algorithms","parallel computation","many-body potentials","carbon modeling","metallic nanostructures","CPU","OpenCL performance","energy-force computation","Lennard-Jones","Tersoff","EAM potentials"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPGPU","CUDA","OpenCL","pair potentials","many-body potentials","neighbor list generation","Lennard-Jones potential","Tersoff potential","embedded-atom potential","atomic operations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237104/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"GPGPU performance evaluation of some basic molecular dynamics algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237104/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15419361","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPGPU performance evaluation of some basic molecular dynamics algorithms","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054247S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7214433","isNumber":"7237005","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7214433","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7237005","articleId":"7237104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237109,"authors":[{"name":"Omar Khedher","affiliation":["E.N.I.T, Innov'com Laboratory, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Omar","lastName":"Khedher","id":"37085414680"},{"name":"Mohamed Jarraya","affiliation":["Saudi Electronic University"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Jarraya","id":"37085419074"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7813-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7812-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7811-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7237109","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Time factors","Benchmark testing","Processor scheduling","Virtual machining","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","cloud computing environment","online services","business IT units","performance improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","high performance","scheduling","optimization"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing covers a wide range of applications, from online services for the end user.

In this paper, we propose a fast and noise-resilient cluster-based anomaly detection method using collective labelling approach. In the proposed Collective Probabilistic Anomaly Detection method, first instead of labelling each new sample (as normal or anomaly) individually, the new samples are clustered, then labelled. This collective labelling mitigates the negative impact of noise by relying on group behaviour rather than individual characteristics of incoming samples. Second, since grouping and labelling new samples may be time-consuming, we summarize clusters using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Not only does GMM offer faster processing speed; it also facilitates summarizing clusters with arbitrary shape, and consequently, reducing the memory space requirement. Finally, a modified distance measure, based on Kullback-Liebner method, is proposed to calculate the similarity among clusters represented by GMMs. We evaluate the proposed method on various datasets by measuring its false alarm rate, detection rate and memory requirement. We also add different levels of noise to the input datasets to demonstrate the performance of the proposed collective anomaly detection method in the presence of noise. The experimental results confirm superior performance of the proposed method compared to individually-based labelling techniques in terms of memory usage, detection rate and false alarm rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Science and Information Conference (SAI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7222825/7237120/07237166.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"344","publicationTitle":"2015 Science and Information Conference (SAI)","doi":"10.1109/SAI.2015.7237166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAI.2015.7237166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237120","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast noise resilient anomaly detection using GMM-based collective labelling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Shape","Training","Gaussian mixture model","Clustering algorithms","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","distance measurement","Gaussian processes","mixture models","pattern clustering","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GMM-based collective labelling","computational complexity","noise-resilient cluster-based anomaly detection method","collective probabilistic anomaly detection method","Gaussian mixture model","distance measurement","Kullback-Liebner method","false alarm rate","detection rate","memory requirement","memory usage","arbitrary shape clustering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Arbitrary Shape Clustering","Gaussian Mixture Model","Collective Labeling","Distribution Distance","Kullback-Liebner distance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237166/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A fast noise resilient anomaly detection using GMM-based collective labelling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237166/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15419940","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast noise resilient anomaly detection using GMM-based collective labelling","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073737S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7222825","isNumber":"7237120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7222825","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7237120","articleId":"7237166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237167,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering & Materials Science, Yale University, New Haven, CT","Department of Mathematics, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085734561"},{"name":"Josh Thompson","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Northern Michigan University, Marquette, MI"],"firstName":"Josh","lastName":"Thompson","id":"37532948000"},{"name":"Chris Peterson","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Peterson","id":"37829331600"},{"name":"Michael Kirby","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kirby","id":"37378211400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8547-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8546-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7237167","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"abstract":"We propose an algorithm for detecting anomalies in video sequences. In order to build an appropriate model, video of nominal activity is utilized to construct an anomaly free representation of the data. The resulting model produces alarm notifications when anomalous activity is observed. The approach involves characterizing segments of video as subspaces and invoking the geometric framework of Grassmann manifolds, i.e., the space of k-dimensional subspaces of n-dimensional space, Gr(k, n). With subspaces treated as points on Gr(k, n) together with a suitably chosen Grassmannian metric, one can exploit novel aspects of the geometry of the data for the purpose of anomaly detection. This mathematical framework is used to extend the Multivariate State Estimation Technique to the context of Grassmann manifolds.

Another algorithm for selecting the most reliable virtual machines for performing customers' requests is presented.","doi":"10.1109/SAI.2015.7237242","publicationTitle":"2015 Science and Information Conference (SAI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Science and Information Conference (SAI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7222825/7237120/07237242.pdf","startPage":"844","endPage":"849","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAI.2015.7237242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework for providing a hybrid fault tolerance in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237242/","displayDocTitle":"A framework for providing a hybrid fault tolerance in cloud computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15420096","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237242/","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for providing a hybrid fault tolerance in cloud computing","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059904S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7222825","isNumber":"7237120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7222825","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7237120","articleId":"7237242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237258,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Luis Herrero Agustin","affiliation":["University of Extremadura, Caceres, Extremadura, Spain"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9 Luis","lastName":"Herrero Agustin","id":"37088493753"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8547-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8546-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7237258","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Web services","Proposals","Cities and towns","Computational modeling","Data models","Browsers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","object-oriented programming","software engineering","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven Web applications","AJAX technology","software development approach","UML","component-based methodology","cache protocol","prefetching protocol","high performance Web applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["model-driven architecture","web applications","rich internet applications","AJAX","component-based software engineering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237258","doi":"10.1109/SAI.2015.7237258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAI.2015.7237258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237120","publicationTitle":"2015 Science and Information Conference (SAI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Science and Information Conference (SAI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7222825/7237120/07237258.pdf","startPage":"954","endPage":"964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-driven web applications","abstract":"With the evolution of web 2.0 and the appearance of AJAX technology a new breed of applications for the Web has emerged. However, the low reusability degree achieved and high development costs are the main problems identified in this domain. Another important issue that must be taken into consideration is that the performance degree of this type of applications is drastically affected by latency, since they must be downloaded before they can be used. Therefore, it becomes essential to boost a software development approach to attenuate these problems. This is the reason why this paper proposes a model-driven architecture for developing web applications. Towards this end, the following tasks have been developed: first a new profile extends UML and introduces web concepts at design level, then a new framework supports web application development according to the component-based methodology, and finally a transformation model is proposed to generate the final code semi-automatically. Another contribution of this work is the definition of a cache and a prefetching protocol to reduce latency and provide high performance web applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7237258/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15420027","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model-driven web applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-driven web applications","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05638S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7222825","isNumber":"7237120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7222825","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7237120","articleId":"7237258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7237260,"authors":[{"name":"Eugene Rychkov","affiliation":["Institute of Engineering Physics and Radio Electronics, Siberian Federal University, Krasnoyarsk, Russia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7222825/7237120/7237260/7237260-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eugene Rychkov \u2014 Krasnoyarsk, Russia, PhD student of Radio Engineering department of SFU, doctorant of XLIM of University of Poitiers, thesis theme is \u201cOFDM systems noise-immunity improvement\u201d, passed LabVIEW courses (for PXI and Arduino), Erasmus Mundus 2014 grantee, previously an engineer at JSP \u00abNPP \u00abRadiosvyaz\u00bb and advisor of the Krasnoyarsk robotics club division."]},"firstName":"Eugene","lastName":"Rychkov","id":"38016608700"},{"name":"Victor Patyukov","affiliation":["Institute of Engineering Physics and Radio Electronics, Siberian Federal University, Krasnoyarsk, Russia"],"bio":{"p":["Victor Patyukov \u2014 Scientific advisor."]},"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Patyukov","id":"38019733900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8547-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8546-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7237260","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Noise","Mathematical model","MATLAB","Phase shift keying","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","mathematics computing","mobile communication","OFDM modulation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise immunity estimation","troposphere communication systems","OFDM signals","bit error ratio","OFDM technology tropospheric systems","mobile application","MATLAB","LabVIEW PXI","error probability evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noise immunity","QPSK","OFDM","tropospheric inhomogeneity","Rayleigh fading","lognormal distribution","convolutional coding","PAPR","frequency offset","Doppler shift","weight function","LabVIEW PXI","FPGA XILINX","Radiosvyaz","MATLAB model","WiFi","802.11a","quasi-Rayleigh","BPSK","QPSK","16-QAM","convolutional coding","PAPR reduction","Guard Interval","image transmission","distortions","zero-subcarriers","pilots","5 GHz"]}],"abstract":"Research results are shown and noise immunity estimation is done for based on OFDM technology tropospheric systems, with usage of the noise immunity of classical OFDM systems for mobile application.

Spread spectrum modulation signal has been applied widely in satellite measurement and control, satellite-ground communications, inter-satellite communications. And the spread spectrum signal detection perception is another difficulty in spectrum sensing. Based on wavelet transform (WT) spectrum sensing technology can be applied to the spread spectrum signal sensing systems. The magnitude characteristic of discrete wavelet transform and the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) are applied to space network signal receiver, in order to sense inter-satellite link signal. Compared with energy detection, the detector based on discrete wavelet transform has better detection performance at low SNR. The result of research is expected for providing technical information and support for the future space network management and engineering applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Science and

We favor Reed-Solomon codes because of relative high throughput and sufficient error performance comparing to convolutional codes. We verified hybrid automatic repeat request scheme in two versions. Additionally, we proposed some possible improvements for the mentioned techniques. The frame format and simulation models (two state Markov chains) are explained in details. At the end parameters of the data link layer and their influence on the performance is done. A physical layer turnaround time seems to be the leading factor.

The results show that the proposed adaptive architecture can achieve up to 50% of energy consumption savings compared to existing designs at the cost of an increased area overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient adaptive MIMO decoders","publicationTitle":"2015 Science and Information Conference (SAI)","doi":"10.1109/SAI.2015.7237287","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Science and Information Conference (SAI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7222825/7237120/07237287.pdf","startPage":"1140","endPage":"1143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SAI.2015.7237287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237120","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient adaptive MIMO decoders","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237287/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15432454","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient adaptive MIMO decoders","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"163.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067154S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7222825","isNumber":"7237120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7222825","xplore-issue":"7237120","articleId":"7237287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237290,"authors":[{"name":"G.

In this paper substitutive rule using the Haar, Daubechies 3 (db3) and Cohen Daubechies Feauveau (CDF) 9/7 filters are used for image decomposition and reconstruction. CDF 9/7 is found to be the best filter and is chosen for FPGA implementation. Single level 2D-DWT based image fusion has been performed using substitutive method and then the hardware software co-simulation design has been synthesized in Xilinx ISE 13.1 and implemented on ML605 Virtex 6 FPGA kit.

Supply voltage variations and related effects on output transitions are accurately reproduced, enabling precise estimates of critical system-level timing margins.","doi":"10.1109/SaPIW.2015.7237385","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 19th Workshop on Signal and Power Integrity (SPI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 19th Workshop on Signal and Power Integrity (SPI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7221957/7237380/07237385.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SaPIW.2015.7237385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237380","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power and Signal Integrity co-simulation via compressed macromodels of high-speed transceivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237385/","displayDocTitle":"Power and Signal Integrity co-simulation via compressed macromodels of high-speed transceivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15432124","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237385/","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power and Signal Integrity co-simulation via compressed macromodels of high-speed transceivers","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"11126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070382S","chronDate":"10-13 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7221957","isNumber":"7237380","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7221957","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7237380","articleId":"7237385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237412,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Mei Hwu","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Wen-Mei","lastName":"Hwu","id":"37282333800"},{"name":"Li-Wen Chang","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Li-Wen","lastName":"Chang","id":"37714436000"},{"name":"Hee-Seok Kim","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Hee-Seok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085698534"},{"name":"Abdul Dakkak","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Abdul","lastName":"Dakkak","id":"37085687360"},{"name":"Izzat El Hajj","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Izzat","lastName":"El Hajj","id":"37085390441"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7197-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9279-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7196-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7237412","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Programming","Performance evaluation","Libraries","Hardware","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","C++ language","graphics processing units","parallel processing","software maintenance","software portability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HPC software transitioning","exascale heterogeneous computing","Blue Waters","heterogeneous CPU-GPU computational units","pervasive deployment","production applications","OpenCL","OpenACC","C++AMP","performance portability","performance maintainability","programming systems","TANGRAM","Troilet","productivity enhancement"]}],"abstract":"An increasing portion of the top supercomputers in the world, including Blue Waters, have heterogeneous CPUGPU computational units. As we move towards exascale, we can expect even more pervasive deployment of heterogeneous computational units. While a handful of science teams can already use heterogeneous computational units in their production applications, there is still significant room for the growing use. This paper presents the current state and projected path for transitioning software into this new paradigm. We first summarize the currently practical languages such as OpenCL, OpenACC, and C++AMP, in increasing levels of productivity, highlighting their recent advancements in supporting performance portability and maintainability. We will then give a brief overview of some emerging programming systems such as TANGRAM and Troilet that are designed to further enhance developer productivity for heterogeneous computing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transitioning HPC software to exascale heterogeneous computing","doi":"10.1109/CEM.2015.7237412","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEM.2015.7237412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237408","publicationTitle":"2015 Computational Electromagnetics International Workshop (CEM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Computational Electromagnetics International Workshop (CEM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219494/7237408/07237412.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Transitioning HPC software to exascale heterogeneous computing","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237412/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15419465","conferenceDate":"1-4 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transitioning HPC software to exascale heterogeneous computing","confLoc":"Izmir, Turkey","sourcePdf":"102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052045S","chronDate":"1-4 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219494","isNumber":"7237408","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219494","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7237408","articleId":"7237412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237424,"authors":[{"name":"Constantinos A.

An automatic white balance algorithm based on the chromaticity difference is proposed, in which adopts the color difference formula CIE 1976Lab, comparing the Chromatic difference with threshold value of adjacent pixels and removing the interference pixels, the color temperature will be more accurate. And using integer multiplies and shift operation instead of floating-point arithmetic, the transformation from RGB color system to XYZ color space is optimized. This paper will start with description of algorithm principles. Following this, Chromatic difference white balance module will be built combining with DSP builder, and using Signal Compiler, the algorithm will be implemented by transplanting codes into FPGA.

To improve the link capacity of ground mobile nodes, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as relay platforms. By establishing a communication relay chain between ground mobile nodes, UAVs can provide required communication quality for ground nodes. Since ground nodes are continuously moving, UAVs also need to control their motion to maintain the relay chain. However, existing work have not considered the mobility of ground nodes or not set the link capacity as optimization objects. In this paper, we study the optimization problem of motion control of UAVs to maximize the link capacity of two ground mobile nodes. We propose an artificial potential field (APF) based solution. In APF-based solution, communication object is formulated as attractive force and collision avoidance of UAVs are formulated as repulsive force. UAVs change their speed and heading angle under the joint force. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed APF-based solution has better performance than gradient estimate method under different scenarios. We also analyze the impact of motion constrains of UAVs and show that the performance of APF-based solution can be improve when loosing some of the motion constraints.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237535/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237535/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15419534","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle chain to improve link capacity of two mobile nodes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle chain to improve link capacity of two mobile nodes","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2015090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069931S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219495","isNumber":"7237445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219495","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7237445","articleId":"7237535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237543,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyun Jiang","affiliation":["Yunnan Power Grid Corporation, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Hongyun","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085643518"},{"name":"Hong Yu","affiliation":["Mechanical Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086475000"},{"name":"Hui Xu","affiliation":["Power Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Xu","id":"37087938556"},{"name":"Guochao Qian","affiliation":["Yunnan Power Grid Corporation, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Guochao","lastName":"Qian","id":"37085856926"},{"name":"Zhongxi Lu","affiliation":["Yunnan Power Grid Corporation, Kunming, China"],"firstName":"Zhongxi","lastName":"Lu","id":"37087935920"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7098-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7097-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"7237543","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237543","abstract":"The power transformer is the most important equipment in the power system, so the condition-based maintenance of the transformer has an important significance for the safe and stable operation of the power grid, and condition assessment provides an important basis for the condition-based maintenance.

low-power SoC-based moving target detection system for amphibious spherical robots","abstract":"A moving target detection and tracking system is critical important for autonomous mobile robot to accomplish complicated tasks. Aiming at application requirements of our amphibious spherical robot proposed in previous researches, a low-power and portable moving target detection system was designed and implemented in this paper. Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC (System on Chip) was used to fabricate the image processing system of the robot for detection and tracking. An OmniVision OV7670 COMS image sensor controlled by customized IP cores in the PL (Programmable Logic) of the SoC was adopted to acquire 640\u00d7480 RGB images at 30 frames per second. The Gaussian background modeling method was implemented with Vivado HLS in the PL to detect moving targets. And a FCT (Fast Compressive Tracking) tracker with motion estimation mechanism was running in the PS (Processing System) of the SoC to track targets captured by the detection subsystem subsequently. Besides, the dynamical power management (DPM) and the dynamical voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) mechanisms were used for a higher power-efficiency. Experimental results verified the validation and performance of the detection system. The design in this paper may have reference value for vision-based mobile robots or vehicles.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237642/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15419573","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237642/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A low-power SoC-based moving target detection system for amphibious spherical robots","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-power SoC-based moving target detection system for amphibious spherical robots","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2015197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095864S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219495","isNumber":"7237445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219495","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7237445","articleId":"7237642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7237655,"authors":[{"name":"Si Zhang","affiliation":["Intelligent Robotics Institute, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Si","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37961348500"},{"name":"Ye Tian","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, (Beijing Institute of Technology), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Tian","id":"37288289100"},{"name":"Xuechao Chen","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, (Beijing Institute of Technology), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuechao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37694180400"},{"name":"Zhangguo Yu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, (Beijing Institute of Technology), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhangguo","lastName":"Yu","id":"37631550600"},{"name":"Qiang Huang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Decision of Complex System, Beijing, China","Ministry of Education, (Beijing Institute of Technology), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085351766"},{"name":"Yunhui Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Ministry of Education, (Beijing Institute of Technology), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yunhui","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085450756"},{"name":"Junyao Gao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Decision of Complex System, Beijing, China","Ministry of Education, (Beijing Institute of Technology), Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Junyao","lastName":"Gao","id":"37292260100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7098-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7097-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"7237655","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"abstract":"Humanoid robot is easy to slip and become unstable when it walks fast or runs because of the large yaw torque. This paper works on improving stability of humanoid robot for fast walking through arm and waist motion design. Inspired by human walking mechanism, we present a method for generating a human-like motion pattern though arm and waist motion design for a humanoid robot. The method is to compensate the yaw torque generated by the swing leg. More specifically, we extend our previous work on yaw torque compensation by adding vertical waist motion of the robot instead of restricting the waist motion on a certain height. And the effectiveness of this method is confirmed by the experiments conducted in simulation with a walking motion at the speed of 2km/h.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219495/7237445/07237655.pdf","startPage":"1193","endPage":"1198","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237445","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The arm and waist motion design of humanoid robot for fast walking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Torque","Joints","Humanoid robots","Acceleration","Robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","humanoid robots","motion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waist motion design","arm motion design","humanoid robot","human walking mechanism","human-like motion pattern","swing leg","yaw torque compensation","vertical waist motion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Yaw torque compensation","Vertical waist motion","Humanoid robot","Fast walking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"The arm and waist motion design of humanoid robot for fast walking","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237655/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15419537","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The arm and waist motion design of humanoid robot for fast walking","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2015210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058209S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219495","isNumber":"7237445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219495","xplore-issue":"7237445","articleId":"7237655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237687,"authors":[{"name":"Guoqing Xia","affiliation":["College of Automation Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Guoqing","lastName":"Xia","id":"37275064300"},{"name":"Ang Zhao","affiliation":["College of Automation Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085355753"},{"name":"Xinghua Chen","affiliation":["College of Automation Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xinghua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085650570"},{"name":"Guoqing Wang","affiliation":["College of Automation Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Guoqing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085638333"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7098-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7097-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"7237687","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine vehicles","Mathematical model","Noise","Algorithm design and analysis","Noise measurement","Computational modeling","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["identification","interference suppression","matrix algebra","nonlinear control systems","position control","recursive estimation","robust control","ships"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear model identification","recursive subspace method","online identification algorithm","dynamic positioning system","ship model","Hammerstein form","subspace identification method","robustness","identification procedure","updating strategy","Givens rotation matrices","online identification method","DP-3 simulation system","calm sea condition","noise interference","input/output measurement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["system identification","subspace methods","dynamic positioning","Hammerstein model"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an online identification algorithm of ships for the dynamic positioning system.

The conventional neural network based fault diagnosis algorithms are not able to deal with human knowledge, while the fuzzy system based fault diagnosis methods face the problems of poor self-learning, poor self-organization etc. In fact, the above two kinds of methods can make up for each other's shortcomings. Thus, this paper presents a new fault diagnosis method based on the combination of fuzzy logic and RBF neural network. Further, a modified particle swarm algorithm is proposed for to optimize the structure parameters of fuzzy neural network. Thus, the fault diagnosis model of CNC machine spindle servo system with the improved particle swarm optimized fuzzy neural network is established. The experiment results show that the proposed method has higher fault identification accuracy and stronger generalization ability, compared with the RBF neural network and the standard particle swarm optimized fuzzy neural network.","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237697","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","startPage":"1442","endPage":"1447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237445","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219495/7237445/07237697.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Fault diagnosis","Computer numerical control","Particle swarm optimization","Fuzzy neural networks","Training","Servomotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised numerical control","fault diagnosis","fuzzy neural nets","machine tool spindles","particle swarm optimisation","production engineering computing","radial basis function networks","servomechanisms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved particle swarm optimization","fuzzy neural network","fault diagnosis","computer numerical control machine","fuzzy logic","RBF neural network","radial basis function network","CNC machine spindle servo system","generalization ability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fault diagnosis","fuzzy neural network","computer numerical control (CNC) machine","particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improved particle swarm optimized fuzzy neural network based fault diagnosis for computer numerical control machine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237697/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237697/","accessionNumber":"15419629","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved particle swarm optimized fuzzy neural network based fault diagnosis for computer numerical control machine","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2015252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110905S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219495","isNumber":"7237445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219495","xplore-issue":"7237445","articleId":"7237697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237701,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Zhan","affiliation":["Intelligent Robotics Institute Beijing Institute of Technology University 5# Nandajie, Zhongguancun, Haidian Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37085718468"},{"name":"Xing-guang Duan","affiliation":["Intelligent Robotics Institute Beijing Institute of Technology University 5# Nandajie, Zhongguancun, Haidian Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xing-guang","lastName":"Duan","id":"37276797500"},{"name":"Jian-xi Li","affiliation":["Intelligent Robotics Institute Beijing Institute of Technology University 5# Nandajie, Zhongguancun, Haidian Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian-xi","lastName":"Li","id":"37310375400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7098-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7097-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"7237701","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":329},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surgery","Robot sensing systems","Accuracy","Instruments","Force","Force sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-robot interaction","manipulators","medical robotics","surgery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["comanipulation robot","human-robot Interaction","HRI","surgery robot","backdrivability","active constrain control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Comanipulation","Backdrivability","Active constrain","Registration","Human-robot interaction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237701","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237701","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","abstract":"Interaction of human and robot (HRI) is the main problem that impacts the development of robot, especially the surgery robot.

The sensitivity, specificity, Youden index, and accuracy of LR model were 0.8623, 0.8616, 0.7239 and 0.8618 versus 0.8563, 0.8854, 0.7417 and 0.8771 for the ANN. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.924 for LR model and 0.933 for the ANN, respectively. Comparison of ANN to LR model showed no statistically significant difference. The above results verified the high diagnostic validity of these two models. LR and ANN model can be incorporated into urologic decision making to assist the clinician making diagnosis and treatment and to reduce the unnecessary biopsies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237702/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15419601","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237702/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Predictive models for prostate cancer based on logistic regression and artificial neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive models for prostate cancer based on logistic regression and artificial neural network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2015257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072291S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219495","isNumber":"7237445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219495","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7237445","articleId":"7237702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7237721,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Guo","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory for Control Theory & Applications in Complicated Systems and Biomedical Robot Laboratory Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Guo","id":"37290747200"},{"name":"Guoqiang Wu","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory for Control Theory & Applications in Complicated Systems and Biomedical Robot Laboratory Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Guoqiang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085700541"},{"name":"Shuxiang Guo","affiliation":["Intelligent Mechanical Systems Engineering Department Faculty of Engineering, Kagawa University, Takamatsu, Japan","Tianjin Key Laboratory for Control Theory & Applications in Complicated Systems and Biomedical Robot Laboratory Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Shuxiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37274155200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7098-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7097-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"7237721","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":562},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PD control","Fuzzy control","Niobium","Legged locomotion","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","large-scale systems","mobile robots","motion control","robot dynamics","stability","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy PID algorithm-based motion control","spherical amphibious robot","single fuzzy control","control system","amphibious spherical robot","control problem","complex system","fuzzy PID control","stability","dynamic performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amphibious spherical robot","Fuzzy PID control","PID control","Dynamic performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237721","abstract":"Fuzzy control and PID control are often used in control area.

However, these benefits are accompanied with inherent challenges that are due to the higher mobility of the vehicular nodes. One of the major problems faced is the induced Doppler Shift (DS) in the carrier frequency of the transceiver node. This paper attempts to decrypt the effect of the DS impact in a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) or Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication based system. Mobile nodes moving at a relative speed of 25 to 250 km/h are considered. Using a fixed modulation code scheme, the degradation effect in term of Bit Error Rate (BER) is analysed under variable signal strength condition. Using the principle of Monte-Carlo, intense simulations are carried with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI). The results obtained from simulations prompted the derivation of a mathematical model. Considering the BER threshold limit defined by the standard, multiple simulation results are optimized to develop the composite result called the DS signature. The final product is then presented as the mathematical model of the DS signature accounting for all channel realisations when the MCS BPSK rate 3/4 is used in a Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doppler shift signature for BPSK in a vehicular Network: IEEE 802.11p","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237749","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219495/7237445/07237749.pdf","startPage":"1744","endPage":"1749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237445","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Doppler shift signature for BPSK in a vehicular Network: IEEE 802.11p","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237749/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15432027","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doppler shift signature for BPSK in a vehicular Network: IEEE 802.11p","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2015304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041428S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219495","isNumber":"7237445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219495","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7237445","articleId":"7237749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237782,"authors":[{"name":"Yuancan Huang","affiliation":["School of Mechatronical Engineering Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuancan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37536903100"},{"name":"Zonglin Huang","affiliation":["School of Mechatronical Engineering Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zonglin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085612382"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7098-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7097-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"7237782","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237782","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kinematics","Parallel robots","Actuators","Neural networks","Mathematical model","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["end effectors","error compensation","manipulator dynamics","manipulator kinematics","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","torque control","trajectory control","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic trajectory tracking","Delta parallel robot","geometric method","forward kinematic","inverse kinematics","dynamics model","virtual work principle","computed torque method based controller","nonlinear properties","neural-network based controller","errors compensation","model parameters uncertainties","end effector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delta parallel robot","Kinematics","Dynamics","Neural Network","Trajectory Tracking"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237782","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219495/7237445/07237782.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","startPage":"1938","endPage":"1943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237782","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural Network based dynamic trajectory tracking of Delta parallel robot","abstract":"This paper proposes a geometric method to solve the forward kinematic of the Delta parallel robot and then study the workspace.

Underwater vehicle research is increasingly active. This paper has focused on characteristic analysis in Water for an amphibious spherical robot. The amphibious spherical robot consists of a circular acrylic plate, a sealed hemispheroid, two mechanical arms and four drive units. Each of drive unit includes a water-jet propeller and two servo motors. The rotation angle of the servo motor can be changed by adjusting the duty ratio of the motor. In order to evaluate the performance of the amphibious spherical robot, we have done the experiment of forward motion in water, rotating experiment, floating and diving experiment. From the results we found that the robot had a maximum forward speed of 9.6 cm/s. Besides, the velocity was approximate linear change when the duty ranged from 30% to 90%. As to rotating experiment, when the PWM input signal was 100%, the angular velocity of spherical amphibious robot was 0.378 rad/s. When the PWM input signal was 10%, the angular velocity was 0.052 rad/s, which was too slow to work well. The angular velocity was approximate linear change when the duty ranged from 40% to 80%. From the floating and diving experiment we found that the diving time was the same whenever load or none-load. However, the load floating time was longer than none-load. The results proved that it is feasible to study performance evaluation for robot and also made a foundation for future research.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servomotors","Propellers","Angular velocity","Robot kinematics","Pulse width modulation","Legged locomotion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular velocity control","autonomous underwater vehicles","oceanography","propellers","pulse width modulation","servomotors","sustainable development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["water characteristic analysis","amphibious spherical robot","world war","ocean","sustainable development","underwater vehicle research","circular acrylic plate","sealed hemispheroid","mechanical arms","drive units","water-jet propeller","servo motors","duty ratio","amphibious spherical robot","maximum forward speed","approximate linear change","angular velocity","PWM input signal","diving experiment","floating experiment","load floating time","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amphibious spherical robot","Evaluation Performance","Duty","Water-jet propeller"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237808","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219495/7237445/07237808.pdf","startPage":"2088","endPage":"2093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characteristic analysis in water for an amphibious spherical robot","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237808","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characteristic analysis in water for an amphibious spherical robot","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237808/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237808/","accessionNumber":"15419778","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characteristic analysis in water for an amphibious spherical robot","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2015363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080607S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219495","isNumber":"7237445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219495","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7237445","articleId":"7237808","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7237809,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Li","affiliation":["Applications in Complicated Systems, Tianjin University of Technology Binshui Xidao, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Li","id":"37085707604"},{"name":"Jian Guo","affiliation":["Applications in Complicated Systems, Tianjin University of Technology Binshui Xidao, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Guo","id":"37085616448"},{"name":"Shuxiang Guo","affiliation":["Intelligent Mechanical Systems Engineering, Kagawa University Takamasu, Kagawa, Japan","Applications in Complicated Systems, Tianjin University of Technology Binshui Xidao, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Shuxiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37274155200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7098-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7097-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"7237809","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"abstract":"The micro-signal communication technology for the underwater vehicle is one of the important components of robot. With the rapid development of spherical amphibious robot, many high-tech scientific research institutions and universities around the world are studying the development and application of underwater robot. Recently, RF (radio frequency) has been widely adopted in the field for distant wireless communication. The OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) method is a better way in signal transmission. As a kind of multi-carrier OFDM modulation technology, this method contains high frequency utilization, suitable for high speed data transmission and narrowband interference, etc. This paper proposed the OFDM modulation mode in the process of controlling the spherical amphibious robot. OFDM technology is able to decrease signal fading, which is suitable for distance information transmission in underwater robot. We carried out simulation experiments, with LS channel estimation and without channel estimation algorithm. The simulation results indicated that when added LS channel estimation in simulation experiment, it can effectively reduce the bit error rate, on the other hand, the simulation without LS channel estimation, bit error rate decreases relatively slowly. OFDM modulation method is a kind of mode in radio frequency communication module, which greatly decreased the bit error rate and maintain the signal transmission.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219495/7237445/07237809.pdf","startPage":"2094","endPage":"2099","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237445","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM-based micro-signal communication method for the spherical amphibious underwater vehicle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robots","Channel estimation","Frequency division multiplexing","Software","Bit error rate","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","mobile robots","OFDM modulation","radio networks","signal processing","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","micro signal communication method","spherical amphibious underwater vehicle","micro signal communication technology","spherical amphibious robot","underwater robot","distant wireless communication","radio frequency","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing method","signal transmission","multicarrier OFDM modulation technology","narrowband interference","data transmission","signal fading","channel estimation algorithm","bit error rate","radio frequency communication module","OFDM modulation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amphibious Spherical robot","OFDM(Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing)","DAQ(Data acquisition card)","LabVIEW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"OFDM-based micro-signal communication method for the spherical amphibious underwater vehicle","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237809/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15432017","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM-based micro-signal communication method for the spherical amphibious underwater vehicle","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2015364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04984S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219495","isNumber":"7237445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219495","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7237445","articleId":"7237809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237813,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, P.R.

In conventional approaches, cell deformability is evaluated based on cell's velocity through a constriction channel where the cell is deformed due to geometrical constraints. A stiff cell would move slower due to a greater resistance generated from the deformation. The pressure driving the flow inside the microfluidic system is assumed constant everywhere all the time. However, the assumption is not exactly true since instant change of flow resistance happens while a cell passing through the constriction. Such pressure change could affect the evaluation results, and should be suppressed as much as possible. In this work, we firstly investigate how such cell appearance affecting the local flow resistance and pressure change with theoretical modeling. After that, we proposed and fabricated a new microfluidic design to overcome such pressure variation. Two parallel channels are placed above and below the constriction channel, and the purpose is to reduce the resistance change due to cell appearance inside the constriction. Human red blood cells are tested, and the results give that the absolute correlation between cell size and velocity significantly improved from 0.42 to 0.63. The increased correlation physically makes sense because greater deformation causes a greater resistance which lowers cell velocity more. Therefore, the experimental results show that the proposed design effectively improves the cell evaluation from conventional approaches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237817","doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237817","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219495/7237445/07237817.pdf","startPage":"2139","endPage":"2144","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","Immune system","Correlation","Resistors","Microscopy","Optical variables measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological techniques","biomechanics","bioMEMS","cellular biophysics","deformation","microchannel flow"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microfluidic chip","cell deformability extraction","microfluidic design","stable local pressure","constriction channel","geometrical constraints","flow resistance","human red blood cells","cell size","cell velocity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["microfluidics","cell evaluation","red blood cell"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel microfluidic chip for extracting cell deformability","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","displayDocTitle":"Novel microfluidic chip for extracting cell deformability","htmlLink":"/document/7237817/","accessionNumber":"15419598","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel microfluidic chip for extracting cell deformability","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2015372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063247S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219495","isNumber":"7237445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219495","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7237445","articleId":"7237817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7237855,"authors":[{"name":"Yupeng Li","affiliation":["College of Automation Harbin Engineering University Nangang District, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yupeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085642886"},{"name":"Ying Liu","affiliation":["College of Automation Harbin Engineering University Nangang District, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085655233"},{"name":"Ping Huang","affiliation":["College of Automation Harbin Engineering University Nangang District, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Huang","id":"37539284300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7098-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7097-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-7096-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-7431"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-744X"}],"articleNumber":"7237855","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7237855","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Array signal processing","Optimization","Interference","Convergence","Arrays","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified hybrid invasive weed optimization algorithm","array antenna beamforming","signal cancellation","MHIWO algorithm","distribution variance","global convergence","local convergence","modified adaptive dispersion invasive weed optimization","MADIWO algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Invasive weed optimization","adaptive beamforming","high precision","convergence rate"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237855","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Mechatronics and Automation (ICMA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219495/7237445/07237855.pdf","startPage":"2358","endPage":"2362","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMA.2015.7237855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7237445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An modified hybrid invasive weed optimization for array antenna beamforming","abstract":"To reduce the desired signal cancellation at high input SNR as well as improving the precision of antenna array beamforming, an modified hybrid invasive weed optimization (MHIWO) algorithm is proposed in this paper. A new distribution variance takes the place of the exponential function used in the original invasive weed optimization(IWO), thus can balance the global convergence and the local convergence well. Additionally, the t-distribution function is used as the spatial distribution of the offspring seeds. Simulations are performed based on sphere, rastrigin and ackley functions to demonstrate the high precision and high convergence rate of the proposed method as compared with IWO, modified adaptive dispersion invasive weed optimization (MADIWO) and MHIWO. The viability of the improved algorithm is also illustrated in the application of antenna array beamforming. When compared with typical beamforming, MHIWO algorithm can suppress the interference successfully and is not inclined to falling into local optimal solution. Furthermore MHIWO based beamforming can obtain high output SINR even at high input SNR.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237855/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15432033","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237855/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An modified hybrid invasive weed optimization for array antenna beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An modified hybrid invasive weed optimization for array antenna beamforming","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2015410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059524S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219495","isNumber":"7237445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219495","xplore-issue":"7237445","articleId":"7237855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7237857,"authors":[{"name":"Jingyu Gao","affiliation":["Department of Control & Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, P.R.

However, when the DBM is used in scene recognition, it is difficult to handle large images due to its computational complexity. In this paper, we present a deep learning method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and DBM for scene image recognition. First, in order to categorize large images, the CNN is utilized to preprocess images for dimensional reduction. Then, regarding the preprocessed images as the input of the visible layer, the DBM model is trained using Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm. Finally, after extracting features by the DBM, the softmax regression is employed to perform scene recognition tasks. Since the CNN can reduce effectively image size, the proposed method can improve the computational efficiency and becomes more suitable for large image recognition. Experimental evaluations using SIFT Flow dataset and fifteen-scene dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain promising results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7237857/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15419787","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7237857/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Natural scene recognition based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Deep Boltzmannn Machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Natural scene recognition based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Deep Boltzmannn Machines","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ICMA2015412.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062337S","chronDate":"2-5 Aug. 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219495","isNumber":"7237445","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219495","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7237445","articleId":"7237857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7238078,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Werner","affiliation":["Universit\u00e4t zu L\u00fcbeck, Institute of Information Systems, L\u00fcbeck, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Werner","id":"37951831700"},{"name":"Dennis Heinrich","affiliation":["Universit\u00e4t zu L\u00fcbeck, Institute of Information Systems, L\u00fcbeck, Germany"],"firstName":"Dennis","lastName":"Heinrich","id":"37085366203"},{"name":"Jannik Piper","affiliation":["Universitat zu Lubeck, Lubeck, Schleswig-Holstein, DE"],"firstName":"Jannik","lastName":"Piper"},{"name":"Sven Groppe","affiliation":["Universitat zu Lubeck, Lubeck, Schleswig-Holstein, DE"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Groppe"},{"name":"Rico Backasch","affiliation":["Universit\u00e4t zu L\u00fcbeck, Institute of Information Systems, L\u00fcbeck, Germany"],"firstName":"Rico","lastName":"Backasch","id":"37085343786"},{"name":"Christopher Blochwitz","affiliation":["Universit\u00e4t zu L\u00fcbeck, Institute of Information Systems, L\u00fcbeck, Germany"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Blochwitz","id":"37085630747"},{"name":"Thilo Pionteck","affiliation":["Universit\u00e4t zu L\u00fcbeck, Institute of Information Systems, L\u00fcbeck, Germany"],"firstName":"Thilo","lastName":"Pionteck","id":"37266691300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7942-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7941-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7238078","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Field programmable gate arrays","Arrays","Engines","Semantic Web","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","graph theory","query processing","semantic Web"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated hardware-accelerated operator graph composition","semantic Web queries","hardware-software system","field programmable gate array","FPGA","database front-end","runtime-reconfigurable framework","static partition","dynamic partition","query template"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present the fully automated composition and execution of Semantic Web queries within a hardware/software system which uses a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) as an accelerator. The presented approach allows to write a query in the database's front-end, transparently executes all steps to retrieve a configuration suitable for the FPGA which represents the given query, and obtains the result by evaluating the query on the FPGA. In order to obtain a runtime-reconfigurable framework we define a static and a dynamic partition. The dynamic partition itself is composed by using a predefined query template and a pool of operators. The operators of the given query are written automatically into the template and connected accordingly. After reconfiguration of the FPGA the host system supplies the initial data to the FPGA which computes the final result and sends it back to the host system to be displayed to the user or application. The evaluation shows that not all queries may take benefit from a dedicated hardware-accelerator but shows promising speedup for complex queries.","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2015.7238078","publicationTitle":"2015 10th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190940/7231035/07238078.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2015.7238078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated composition and execution of hardware-accelerated operator graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238078/","displayDocTitle":"Automated composition and execution of hardware-accelerated operator graphs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15418061","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238078/","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated composition and execution of hardware-accelerated operator graphs","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"AutomatedCompositionWerner3754995.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090964S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190940","isNumber":"7231035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190940","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7231035","articleId":"7238078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238082,"authors":[{"name":"Boyang Du","affiliation":["CAD Group - Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"lastName":"Boyang Du","id":"37074540500"},{"name":"Luca Sterpone","affiliation":["CAD Group - Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Sterpone","id":"37085491857"},{"name":"Lorenzo Venditti","affiliation":["CAD Group - Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Venditti","id":"37085684804"},{"name":"David Merodio Codinachs","affiliation":["European Space Agency, Noordwijk, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"David Merodio","lastName":"Codinachs","id":"37540698100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7942-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7941-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7238082","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Field programmable gate arrays","Routing","System-on-chip","Memory management","Reliability engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radiation-induced soft errors","dynamic RAM chips","reconfigurable FPGA devices","SRAM configuration memories","digital logic","soft errors detection","soft errors protection","soft errors mitigation","design rules","route algorithm","SoC","dynamic-reconfiguration oriented SRAM-based FPGA","radiation test","proton particles","error cross-section reduction"]}],"abstract":"Radiation-induced Soft Errors are widely known since the advent of dynamic RAM chips. Reconfigurable FPGA devices based on SRAM configuration memories are extremely sensitive to these effects resulting in an unwelcome change of behavior in digital logic.

Detection, protection and mitigation of soft errors beyond aerospace and defence applications have been widely debated over the last decades. In the present paper we provide a complete design flow illustrating the proper design rules ranging from the synthesis, mapping and physical place and route algorithm tailored to the implementation of high performance and reliable SoCs using dynamic-reconfiguration oriented SRAM-based FPGAs.

Examples of such monitoring information are power or temperature values. They provide the system with relevant information about the current hardware health. In a resource-aware computing system, where resources are allocated according to current requirements, the current hardware status must be included in the decisions for resource allocation in order to select the best suitable application-resource pairs and at the same time reach system targets like limiting the system temperature.To test and optimize the system's resource allocation already in the design phase, FPGA prototyping is often required before its implementation in an ASIC. Since the behavior of measured power and temperature evolution in FPGA and ASIC differ, data from power and temperature sensors on both platforms would have significant differences. To efficiently test and optimize the resource allocation for an ASIC implementation, it is necessary to provide the FPGA prototype with modeled power and temperature values characterized from an ASIC implementation. This paper describes how to emulate the behavior of an emulated ASIC power and temperature monitor system (eTPMon) on FPGA. The approach for emulating the power monitor is based on an instruction-level energy model. For emulating the temperature monitor, a thermal RC model is used. It is shown that eTPMon can supply an invasive MPSoC with the hardware status information (power and temperature of the cores) needed for efficient resource-aware load distribution to develop a resource-aware computing system concept. As a proof of concept different operating strategies and control targets were evaluated for a 2-tile invasive MPSoC.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Temperature measurement","Temperature sensors","Program processors","Application specific integrated circuits","Field programmable gate arrays","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit packaging","logic design","multiprocessing systems","system-on-chip","thermal management (packaging)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ASIC power monitor emulation","temperature monitor system emulation","FPGA prototyping","resource aware computing system","resource allocation","instruction level energy model","thermal RC model","resource aware load distribution","MPSoC","multiprocessor system-on-chip"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238083","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2015.7238083","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2015 10th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190940/7231035/07238083.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2015.7238083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238083/","displayDocTitle":"Emulation of an ASIC power and temperature monitor system for FPGA prototyping","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 1 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15418065","htmlLink":"/document/7238083/","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emulation of an ASIC power and temperature monitor system for FPGA prototyping","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"EmulationASICGlocker3756111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078918S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190940","isNumber":"7231035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190940","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7231035","articleId":"7238083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238086,"authors":[{"name":"Alfonso Rodr\u00edguez","affiliation":["Centro de Electronica Industrial, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Alfonso","lastName":"Rodr\u00edguez","id":"37085496286"},{"name":"Juan Valverde","affiliation":["Centro de Electronica Industrial, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Valverde","id":"38490344800"},{"name":"C\u00e9sar Casta\u00f1ares","affiliation":["Centro de Electronica Industrial, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"C\u00e9sar","lastName":"Casta\u00f1ares","id":"37085487865"},{"name":"Jorge Portilla","affiliation":["Centro de Electronica Industrial, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Portilla","id":"37410445300"},{"name":"Eduardo de la Torre","affiliation":["Centro de Electronica Industrial, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"de la Torre","id":"37085720859"},{"name":"Teresa Riesgo","affiliation":["Centro de Electronica Industrial, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Teresa","lastName":"Riesgo","id":"37283653200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7942-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7941-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7238086","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"abstract":"SRAM-based FPGAs have significantly improved their performance and size with the use of newer and ultra-deep-submicron technologies, even though power consumption, together with a time-consuming initial configuration process, are still major concerns when targeting energy-efficient solutions. System self-awareness enables the use of strategies to enhance system performance and power optimization taking into account run-time metrics. This is of particular importance when dealing with reconfigurable systems that may make use of such information for efficient resource management, such as in the case of the ARTICo\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n architecture, which fosters dynamic execution of kernels formed by multiple blocks of threads allocated in a variable number of hardware accelerators, combined with module redundancy for fault tolerance and other dependability enhancements, e.g. side-channel-attack protection.

Evolutionary algorithms typically require testing thousands of candidate solutions, taking long time to complete. It would be desirable to reduce this time to a few seconds for applications that require a fast adaptation to a problem. Also, it is important to consider architectures that may operate at high clock speeds in order to reach very speed-demanding situations. This paper presents an implementation on an FPGA of an evolvable hardware image filter based on a systolic array architecture that uses dynamic partial reconfiguration in order to change between different candidate solutions. The neighbor to neighbor connections of the array offer improved performance versus other approaches, like Cartesian Genetic Programming derived circuits. Time savings due to faster evaluation compensate the slower reconfiguration time compared with virtual reconfiguration approaches, but, at any rate, reconfiguration time has been improved also by reducing the elements to reconfigure to just the LUT contents of the configurable blocks. The techniques presented in this paper lead to circuits that may operate at up to 500 MHz (in a Virtex-5), filtering 500 megapixels per second, the processing element size of the array is reduced to 2 CLBs, and over 80000 evaluations per second in a multiplearray structure in an FPGA permit to obtain good quality filters in around 3 seconds of evolution time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and compact evolvable systolic arrays on dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs","publicationTitle":"2015 10th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2015.7238087","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190940/7231035/07238087.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2015.7238087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238087","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fast and compact evolvable systolic arrays on dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238087/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15418069","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and compact evolvable systolic arrays on dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"FastCompactMora3761823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076387S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190940","isNumber":"7231035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190940","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7231035","articleId":"7238087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238089,"authors":[{"name":"Fynn Schwiegelshohn","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems of Information Technology Ruhr-Universitat - Bochum, Bochum, Nord-Rhein-Westfalen"],"firstName":"Fynn","lastName":"Schwiegelshohn","id":"37061835600"},{"name":"Lars Gierke","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems of Information Technology Ruhr-Universitat - Bochum, Bochum, Nord-Rhein-Westfalen"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Gierke","id":"37085703707"},{"name":"Michael H\u00fcbner","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems of Information Technology Ruhr-Universitat - Bochum, Bochum, Nord-Rhein-Westfalen"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"H\u00fcbner","id":"37300247900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7942-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7941-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7238089","dbTime":"38 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238089","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Feature extraction","Hardware","Image resolution","Image edge detection","Field programmable gate arrays","Program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive engineering","driver information systems","field programmable gate arrays","image resolution","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based traffic sign detection","automotive camera systems","advanced driver assistance systems","ADAS","data processing","camera based image processing system","FullHD resolution","Microblaze softcore","Xilinx","IP core","HDMI","Spartan-6-FPGA","image acquisition","image streams"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Atlys Board","FPGA","Spartan-6","Image processing","Traffic sign detection"]}],"abstract":"Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) have become very prominent in todays automobiles.

Control and monitoring of parameters in hazardous areas have to be performed remotely. In this paper a framework for dynamically reconfiguring data acquisition system has been proposed. The main features of this framework are its ability to be controlled, partially reconfigured and monitored remotely. The proposed framework is capable of detecting the identity of the sensor connected to a partial reconfigurable region. The system uses embedded Linux to implement the configuration, control logic and the device drivers to communicate with the partial reconfigurable region. The proposed framework is tested with an accelerometer ADXL362 as a sensor connected to XC7Z020 SoC from the Xilinx Zynq-7000 family. The system is able to detect the presence and absence of the accelerometer. Partial reconfiguration time of 10 ms and the full reconfiguration time of 310 ms is achieved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework for remote and adaptive partial reconfiguration of SoC based data acquisition systems under Linux","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2015.7238091","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2015.7238091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231035","publicationTitle":"2015 10th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190940/7231035/07238091.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238091","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"A framework for remote and adaptive partial reconfiguration of SoC based data acquisition systems under Linux","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238091/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15418072","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for remote and adaptive partial reconfiguration of SoC based data acquisition systems under Linux","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"FrameworkRemotePrince3753259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039198S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190940","isNumber":"7231035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190940","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7231035","articleId":"7238091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238092,"authors":[{"name":"Yunfeng Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of York"],"lastName":"Yunfeng Ma","id":"37085756531"},{"name":"Leandro Soares Indrusiak","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of York"],"firstName":"Leandro Soares","lastName":"Indrusiak","id":"37265045500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7942-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7941-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7238092","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"abstract":"End-to-End Response Time Analysis (E2ERTA) can be used to examine the timing performance of a Network-on-Chip (NoC).

However, based on cost reduction requirements, the power consumption must also be minimized, as it impacts the battery size and the weight of the satellite. While technology scaling helps in this purpose, it also increases the circuit sensitivity to Multiple-Bit Upsets (MBU), thus specific design techniques must be applied to compensate this effect. In order to leverage high-performance and low-cost Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) FPGAs in space applications, this work tackles fault tolerance along three abstraction levels: circuit, organization and control. At the circuit level, a new ultra-low overhead Forward Temporal Redundancy (FTR) scheme is proposed for error detection in user logic. At the organization level in the FPGA, this work leverages the opportunities brought by frame- and module-based Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) to handle configuration memory errors. At the control level, this work fully exploits the modern Xilinx Zynq System-on-Chip FPGA which embeds a hard processor used for circuit state preservation with checkpointing and rollback. The overall topology is successfully validated with 99.998% reliability through fault-injection for a five-stage pipelined MIPS processor at a global resource overhead of only 85% in LUTs and 125% in flip-flops.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 1 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15418050","htmlLink":"/document/7238095/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Partial Reconfiguration-based scheme to mitigate Multiple-Bit Upsets for FPGAs in low-cost space applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Partial Reconfiguration-based scheme to mitigate Multiple-Bit Upsets for FPGAs in low-cost space applications","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"PartialReconfigurationFrenkel3757725.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069591S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190940","isNumber":"7231035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190940","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7231035","articleId":"7238095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238097,"authors":[{"name":"Arash Firuzan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Pooyesh Institute of Higher Education, Iran"],"firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Firuzan","id":"37085706978"},{"name":"Mehdi Modarressi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Institute for Researches in Fundamental Sciences, Tehran, Iran","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Modarressi","id":"37313759900"},{"name":"Masoud Daneshtalab","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Embedded Systems, Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Daneshtalab","id":"37298922900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7942-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7941-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7238097","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons","Topology","Network topology","Computer architecture","Program processors","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast communication","network-on-chip","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable communication fabric","neural networks","network-on-chip architecture","reconfigurable inter-cluster communication fabric","multicast communication","multicast-based traffic"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network-on-Chip","Neural Networks","Hardware Accelerator","Reconfivuration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238097","abstract":"Handling heavy multicast-based inter-neuron communication is the most challenging issue in parallel implementation of neural networks.

Proposals that move the execution of vector instructions to the DRAM device present good trade-offs in terms of performance, energy consumption and area. Since these previous proposals usually operate at the frequency of the DRAM, they lose opportunities for improvements due to the long clock period of the memory devices. In this paper, we propose Reconfigurable Vector Extensions (RVX), which use Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) to execute vector instructions inside the DRAM. Our mechanism reconfigures the functional units inside the memory in order to combine them and thereby reduce the operation time of the near-data instructions, fully leveraging the potential of near-data processing in the main memory. Comparing to previous near-data processing approaches that move vector instructions to the DRAM, our proposal enables performance gains of up to 31% and reduces the energy consumption by up to 76% of the functional units inside the memory device.","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2015.7238099","publicationTitle":"2015 10th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190940/7231035/07238099.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2015.7238099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Vector Extensions inside the DRAM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238099/","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Vector Extensions inside the DRAM","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238099/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15418068","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Vector Extensions inside the DRAM","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"ReconfigurableVectorAlves3761863.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06734S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190940","isNumber":"7231035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190940","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7231035","articleId":"7238099","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238102,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this paper we present a new method to increase the area efficiency of PUF implementations on FPGA-based SoCs. The complex system of logic and routing resources on FPGAs is analyzed for their usability as entropy sources for PUFs in this work. To maximize the resource usage, different implementations of PUFs are reconfigured on the same area of the FPGA. Each of them occupies the same logic block on an FPGA, but uses different logic and routing resources inside the block. A partial bit vector response is generated by each implementation. All of them are joined to a larger response vector that can be used to generate a cryptographic key. We present an implementation that is able to decrease the required resources to generate a PUF response with a given length by almost 98% on a Xilinx Zynq. The ARM processor system is used to control the reconfiguration of the FPGA. The key itself is exclusively generated and kept inside the FPGA part of the SoC to increase the security.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using the reconfigurability of modern FPGAs for highly efficient PUF-based key generation","doi":"10.1109/ReCoSoC.2015.7238105","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReCoSoC.2015.7238105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7231035","publicationTitle":"2015 10th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 10th International Symposium on Reconfigurable Communication-centric Systems-on-Chip (ReCoSoC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190940/7231035/07238105.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Using the reconfigurability of modern FPGAs for highly efficient PUF-based key generation","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238105/","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15418062","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using the reconfigurability of modern FPGAs for highly efficient PUF-based key generation","confLoc":"Bremen, Germany","sourcePdf":"UsingReconfigurabilityGehrer3761339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08127S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190940","isNumber":"7231035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190940","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7231035","articleId":"7238105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7238141,"authors":[{"name":"Uichi Ishida","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Sciences, Sophia University, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Uichi","lastName":"Ishida","id":"37085745101"},{"name":"Yusuke Yamazaki","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Sciences, Sophia University, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Yamazaki","id":"37085746958"},{"name":"Takao Waho","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Sciences, Sophia University, Chiyoda, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takao","lastName":"Waho","id":"37269788900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1777-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0195-623X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2226"}],"articleNumber":"7238141","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238141","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological neural networks","Quantization (signal)","Analog-digital conversion","Circuits and systems","Neurons","Feedback loop"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","circuit stability","low-power electronics","neural chips","quantisation (signal)","switched current circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonbinary analog-to-digital converter","amoeba-inspired neural network","neural networks","nonbinary coding","circuit simulation","amoeba-inspired computing technique","switched-capacitor circuits","unit neurons","dummy units","circuit operation stability improvement","radix","local minima","quantization error reduction","low-power operation","dynamic analog circuit technique","neuro-ADC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["analog-to-digital converter","neural network","non-binary"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISMVL.2015.13","pdfPath":"/iel7/7217067/7238112/07238141.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Multiple-Valued Logic","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Multiple-Valued Logic","startPage":"103","endPage":"108","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMVL.2015.13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Binary Analog-to-Digital Converter Based on Amoeba-Inspired Neural Network","abstract":"An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on neural networks is proposed, and the feasibility of using no binary coding is discussed with circuit simulation.

In this paper, an early-stage operation-skipping scheme, where stochastic computation is terminated at the early stage by monitoring the intermediate computation result, is introduced for low-power stochastic image processors. In case that the proposed scheme is applied in edge-detection processing as a typical example of image processing, a non-candidate pixel is predicted using a simple threshold detector before the completion of the stochastic edge-detection process. Once the pixel is found, the edge-detection process is stopped, eliminating the stochastic computation at the rest of bits. As a design example, a Robert's operator based stochastic edge detector is implemented using MATLAB. Based on the simulation results, a correlation between an output-image quality using a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) criteria and the reduction ratio of bits is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/ISMVL.2015.28","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Multiple-Valued Logic","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Multiple-Valued Logic","pdfPath":"/iel7/7217067/7238112/07238142.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMVL.2015.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Early-Stage Operation-Skipping Scheme for Low-Power Stochastic Image Processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Early-Stage Operation-Skipping Scheme for Low-Power Stochastic Image Processors","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15419445","publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238142/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238142/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2015","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Early-Stage Operation-Skipping Scheme for Low-Power Stochastic Image Processors","confLoc":"Waterloo, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"1777a109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045066S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7217067","isNumber":"7238112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7217067","xplore-issue":"7238112","articleId":"7238142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7238151,"authors":[{"name":"Aynaz Vatankhahghadim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Aynaz","lastName":"Vatankhahghadim","id":"37085359679"},{"name":"Ali Sheikholeslami","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Sheikholeslami","id":"37274725900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1777-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0195-623X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-2226"}],"articleNumber":"7238151","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":249},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238151","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Switches","Magnetization","Sensors","Resistance","Magnetic anisotropy","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetoresistive devices","MRAM devices","transistors","tunnelling magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilevel cell","STT-MRAM","biaxial magnetic tunnel junction","one-transistor-and-one MTJ","1T1MTJ","biaxial magnetic layer","stable states","current pulses","magnetization vector","multistep write operations","uniaxial MTJ","simulated write speed","current sensing","voltage sensing","biaxial MTJ","uniform sense margin distribution"]}],"abstract":"A multi-level cell for STT-MRAM is proposed using biaxial magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ).

Current pulses with different amplitudes are applied during write operation to switch the magnetization vector to the corresponding region. This avoids multi-step write operations required for previously proposed multi-level cells using uniaxial MTJs.

CQI is crucial in describing the channel information to assign appropriate modulation and coding scheme (MCS). However, obtaining CQI values for each transmission time interval (TTI) inevitably entails use and can lead to an undesirable degradation in spectral efficiency (SE) as well as increasing the error rate. Therefore, providing an accurate and reliable CQI with low overhead is an intricate task. In this paper, a CQI prediction scheme using Feed Forward-Neural Network (FF-NN) algorithm for MU-MIMO-LTE Advanced systems is proposed. Initially, a channel model for MU-MIMO-LTE advanced network is carried out. Through this model, CQI is predicted and the obtained values are compressed using a feedback compression technique. Finally, the proposed technique makes use of FF-NN algorithm to train and achieve enhanced CQI values. Further, an enhanced and accurate CQI values are acquired. Results show that the system SE of single user (SU)-MIMO proportionally increases with the SNR values at the cost of BER. Therefore, a MU-MIMO CQI prediction scheme is recommended to improve the tradeoff between BER and SE.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A channel quality indicator (CQI) prediction scheme using feed forward neural network (FF-NN) technique for MU-MIMO LTE system","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 2nd International Symposium on Telecommunication Technologies (ISTT)","doi":"10.1109/ISTT.2014.7238169","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 2nd International Symposium on Telecommunication Technologies (ISTT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209076/7238162/07238169.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTT.2014.7238169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A channel quality indicator (CQI) prediction scheme using feed forward neural network (FF-NN) technique for MU-MIMO LTE system","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238169/","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15435632","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A channel quality indicator (CQI) prediction scheme using feed forward neural network (FF-NN) technique for MU-MIMO LTE system","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"ISTT201404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06654S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7209076","isNumber":"7238162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209076","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7238162","articleId":"7238169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238173,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

In Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks (CRAHNs), data routing is one of the most challenging tasks due to frequent topology changes and intermittent connectivity caused by the activity of Primary Users (PUs). This paper proposes a joint path and spectrum diversity based routing protocol with an optimized path selection for CRAHNs, referred to the Enhanced Dual Diversity Cognitive Ad-hoc Routing Protocol (E-D2CARP). The Expected Path Delay (EPD) routing metric used in the protocol for path decision is also introduced. The protocol utilizes the joint path and spectrum diversity and circumvents the PU regions during path establishment phase in order to make the transmission path less vulnerable to the impact of PU activities and provide efficient route recovery in presence of path failures resulting from PU activities. The performance evaluations are conducted through simulations using the NS-2 simulator. Simulation results obviously demonstrate that the E-D2CARP can achieve better performance in terms of average throughput, packet loss, average end-to-end delay, and average jitter as compared to the recently proposed D2CARP protocol in identical scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238173/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15435644","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238173/","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"E-D2CARP: A joint path and spectrum diversity based routing protocol with an optimized path selection for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"E-D2CARP: A joint path and spectrum diversity based routing protocol with an optimized path selection for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"ISTT201408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057737S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7209076","isNumber":"7238162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209076","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7238162","articleId":"7238173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238174,"authors":[{"name":"I.

While spectrum sensing (SS) is a critical CRN function, repetitive SS events can significantly reduce the battery life of sensing devices. However, energy efficiency can be improved by employing spectrum opportunity forecasting (SOF) and optimal scheduling for sensor node activation to reduce the required number of SS events. In this paper, a combination of SOF and optimal scheduling is thus explored. The application of SOF to cooperative SS is one of the unique contributions of this paper. Results indicated that this combination could significantly reduce sensor node energy consumption and in so doing increase CRN lifetime. A positive linear relationship was found between forecast length and CRN lifetime. A very large improvement in the collective lifetime of the sensor network was observed when SOF was employed (roughly 21.2 time samples longer than when only optimal scheduling was employed) for a forecast length of ten SS events, using implicit enumeration under the uniform sensor node distribution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238183/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15435648","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238183/","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum opportunity forecasting for energy efficient sensing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum opportunity forecasting for energy efficient sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"ISTT201418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127747S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7209076","isNumber":"7238162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209076","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7238162","articleId":"7238183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238187,"authors":[{"name":"Tareq M.

The 2D source correlation, horizontal and vertical directions of the source are exploited during the decoding process. In order to exploit the source statistics (i.e. transition probabilities), a decoding algorithm based on modified check operation is proposed. This modified check operation has significantly lower computational complexity than the previous technique that based on modified Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm. Simulation results reveal that the proposed technique that based on modified check operation achieves about 4.5 times lower computational complexity than the technique that based on modified BCJR algorithm.

The aim of this paper is to propose Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) to assist MVDR in improving its performance and overcoming both interferences and multipath fading. The simulation results show that the proposed GSA-MVDR algorithm offers higher Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) than PSO-MVDR and conventional MVDR in different scenario of interferences and array elements. It is an effective solution for decreasing the effect of interference and increasing the desired signal simultaneously.","doi":"10.1109/ISTT.2014.7238210","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 2nd International Symposium on Telecommunication Technologies (ISTT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209076/7238162/07238210.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTT.2014.7238210","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 2nd International Symposium on Telecommunication Technologies (ISTT)","startPage":"230","endPage":"235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal null steering of minimum variance distortionless response adaptive beamforming using particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimal null steering of minimum variance distortionless response adaptive beamforming using particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238210/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238210/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15435672","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal null steering of minimum variance distortionless response adaptive beamforming using particle swarm optimization and gravitational search algorithm","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"ISTT201445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123055S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7209076","isNumber":"7238162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209076","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7238162","articleId":"7238210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7238215,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Mohammed Alsahag","affiliation":["Dept.

For multiuser environments, IEEE 802.16 OFDMA systems require a resource allocation algorithm to use the limited downlink resource efficiently. One of the main problems to increase the resource utilization and throughput is how to construct two-dimensional blocks that realize time and frequency dimensions to multi-users. However, mapping a rectangular shape (i.e. two-dimensional burst) that not enough to utilize some flows in downlink frame, decreases total throughput and is crucial for Quality of Service (QoS) that support real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a low complexity algorithm called Best Edge Block Oriented (BEBO) which complies with 802.16 downlink burst characteristics with assurance of real time throughput. The proposed algorithm reduce the unserved slots by assembling bursts in the edge of the free spaces for reducing outdoor spaces from other bursts; and enlarge the internal burst size gradually to minimize the internal free spaces for a given request size with priority level and channel state information considerations. Simulation results show that the burst construction mechanism result is competitive.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional burst construction with QoS assurance for OFDMA mobile WiMAX system","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 2nd International Symposium on Telecommunication Technologies (ISTT)","doi":"10.1109/ISTT.2014.7238215","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 2nd International Symposium on Telecommunication Technologies (ISTT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209076/7238162/07238215.pdf","startPage":"256","endPage":"261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTT.2014.7238215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional burst construction with QoS assurance for OFDMA mobile WiMAX system","conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238215/","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15435675","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional burst construction with QoS assurance for OFDMA mobile WiMAX system","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"ISTT201450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065346S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7209076","isNumber":"7238162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209076","xplore-issue":"7238162","articleId":"7238215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238216,"authors":[{"name":"Rafidah Ahmad","affiliation":["Collaborative MicroElectronic Design Excellence Centre (CEDEC), Universiti Sains Malaysia, Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rafidah","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37408613900"},{"name":"Widad Ismail","affiliation":["Auto-ID Laboratory School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Nibong Tebal, Penang, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Widad","lastName":"Ismail","id":"37297260800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5982-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5981-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7238216","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic interference","Communications technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["advanced encryption standard-128","WiMAX","worldwide interoperability","microwave access","IEEE 802.16 standard","broadband wireless access","AES-128 algorithm","128-bit cipher key","field programmable gate array","Xilinx Virtex5 FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["worldwide interoperability for microwave access","advanced encryption standard","field programmable gate array","performance","power"]}],"abstract":"Worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) which is also known as IEEE 802.16 standard for broadband wireless access continues to gain popularity as a technology with a significant market potential.

This study focuses on the implementation of high performance AES-128 algorithm with 128-bit cipher key on field programmable gate array (FPGA) in terms of architectural and throughput differences as well as power consumption rates. Three different AES-128 designs, including the proposed AES-128 design, are introduced and evaluated. Xilinx Virtex5 FPGA is utilized for implementation and verification purposes. Results show that with Virtex5 FPGA, the proposed AES-128 design reduces the slices by 2% and increases the throughput by 95% compared with the reference designs.

This work aims to investigate the throughput conditions for two widely known scheduling techniques for the purpose of demonstrating ideal yardstick for downlink transmission by using CA technique.

More explicitly, a structured redundancy based on discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is inserted to the speech signal prior to source encoding. At the receiver the soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoder exploits the source index correlation for error protection. Furthermore, the explicit redundancy introduced in the speech signal is exploited to reconstruct the received voice signal with the aid of pseudo-inverse of the overcomplete block transform. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated when communicating over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel.

However, aggressive frequency reuse results in high inter cell interference (ICI) especially at the cell edges. Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) has recently emerged as an attractive interference management approach in OFDMA cellular systems. In literature, FFR is studied mostly for regular cell geometry models and very limited work exists for irregular cell geometry models. In this paper we investigate the performance of FFR for cellular network based on irregular cell geometry. Furthermore, full frequency reuse is achieved by sectoring the cell edge users. Applying regular sub-bands of equal size to the irregular sectors of the cell-edge region leads to suboptimal performance. Therefore, a low complexity FFR scheme with optimal sub-carrier allocation is proposed for multicellular network and the capacity of the system is evaluated. It is shown that the proposed FFR scheme outperform the conventional frequency allocation schemes in term of cell edge throughput.","doi":"10.1109/ISTT.2014.7238233","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 2nd International Symposium on Telecommunication Technologies (ISTT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 2nd International Symposium on Telecommunication Technologies (ISTT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209076/7238162/07238233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTT.2014.7238233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238162","startPage":"346","endPage":"351","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fractional frequency reuse for irregular cell geometry OFDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fractional frequency reuse for irregular cell geometry OFDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238233/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15435670","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7238233/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional frequency reuse for irregular cell geometry OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"ISTT201468.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073004S","chronDate":"24-26 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7209076","isNumber":"7238162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209076","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7238162","articleId":"7238233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238244,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulrahman Shueai Mohsen Alqadami","affiliation":["Universiti Malaysia Perlis, Arau, Perlis, MY"],"firstName":"Abdulrahman Shueai Mohsen","lastName":"Alqadami","id":"37085474204"},{"name":"M.

The classic difficulty of being able to correctly recognize language symbols is the complexity and the irregularity among the pictorial representation of characters due to variation in writing styles, size of symbols etc. Character recognition process depends on, how the input data is given to the system. Input data may be categorized as Online data or Offline data. Both the forms of data input have their own issues. In this paper, we are focusing on the Offline Gurmukhi character recognition from text image. There are lot of complexities associated with Gurmukhi Script. In this paper, we present a technique based on Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network model. Here we consider isolated handwritten Gurmukhi characters for recognition. MLP is used because it uses generalized delta learning rules and easily gets trained in less number of iterations. The proposed method in this paper detect graphical symbols by identifying lines and characters from the image. After that it analyzes the symbols by training the network using feed forward topology for a set of desired unicode characters. We achieve the performance rate of proposed system maximum up to 98.96% for recognition of symbols by using MLP neural network.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238334","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238030","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","pdfPath":"/iel7/7203316/7238030/07238334.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network technique for offline handwritten Gurmukhi character recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238334/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network technique for offline handwritten Gurmukhi character recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238334/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15435372","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network technique for offline handwritten Gurmukhi character recognition","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1400144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091547S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7203316","isNumber":"7238030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7203316","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7238030","articleId":"7238334","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7238341,"authors":[{"name":"Hartaranjit Singh","affiliation":["ECE Department, CTIEMT, Jalandhar, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7203316/7238030/7238341/7238341-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hartaranjit Singh received his degree in B.Tech-ECE in 2011 from Punjab Technical University and is pursuing M.

IWT is an image compression technique wherein the output is in the form of integers thus consuming less memory space. Steganography is done intelligently such that it is difficult for an adversary to detect the existence of a hidden message in the otherwise innocuous data. This united with integer wavelet transform allows high quality data hiding and image compression. To transmit many such images over a network, sometimes over low-capacity phone lines to remote sites, or to store large numbers of images over a long period of time as part of the medical records for patients, the need for image compression arises to alleviate these large demands for image data storage and transmission capacity. The secret information is hidden in cover image using IWT implementation which has been coded in C language to ensure easy realization in real-time applications. The PSNR and execution time for the different images using IWT technique have been computed.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238344","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","pdfPath":"/iel7/7203316/7238030/07238344.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238030","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time implementation of steganography in medical images using integer wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time implementation of steganography in medical images using integer wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238344/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15435463","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7238344/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time implementation of steganography in medical images using integer wavelet transform","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1400164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114572S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7203316","isNumber":"7238030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7203316","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7238030","articleId":"7238344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238350,"authors":[{"name":"Ajay Kumar Boyat","affiliation":["MITM Indore, Department of ECE, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7203316/7238030/7238350/7238350-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ajay Boyat is an Assistant Professor in Electronics & Communication Engineering at Medi-Caps Institute of Technology and Management, Indore (M.P.), India.

This paper presents a swarm based algorithm to address the above said optimization process. Objective function based on speed deviations is employed to calculate the parameters of PSSs of New England System (10 Generator & 39 Bus). To present a meaningful analysis the comparison of SSO is done with conventional optimization algorithms namely Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). Robustness of proposed method is tested over different type of perturbations, fault locations and loading conditions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238398","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","pdfPath":"/iel7/7203316/7238030/07238398.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238398","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of damping controller for multimachine power system by using simplified swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Design of damping controller for multimachine power system by using simplified swarm optimization","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/7238398/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15435522","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238398/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of damping controller for multimachine power system by using simplified swarm optimization","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1400256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06472S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7203316","isNumber":"7238030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7203316","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7238030","articleId":"7238398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238399,"authors":[{"name":"Venkatesh Kamini","affiliation":["Centre of Excellence in CRM and Analytics, Institute for Development and Research Banking Technology (IDRBT), Masab Tank, Hyderabad, AP, India"],"firstName":"Venkatesh","lastName":"Kamini","id":"37085727225"},{"name":"Vadlamani Ravi","affiliation":["Centre of Excellence in CRM and Analytics, Institute for Development and Research Banking Technology (IDRBT), Masab Tank, Hyderabad, AP, India"],"firstName":"Vadlamani","lastName":"Ravi","id":"37602769900"},{"name":"D.

In the first method (traditional, non-chaotic) missing values of the time series are imputed and data is deseasonalized with a time lag of seven days as a preprocessing step. Then, techniques namely Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Wavelet Neural Network (WNN) and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) are applied in the forecasting phase. In the second method (non-traditional, chaotic), we reconstructed the phase space using the chaotic parameters, viz., embedding dimension and delay time using TISEAN tool, while forecasting of the resulting time series is taken care of by GRNN, MLP and Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH). With the optimal embedding dimension and delay time of 2 and 3 respectively, GRNN yielded a SMAPE value of 14.71%. This result convincingly outperformed the results of Andrawis et al.

The aim of this paper is to detect the traffic density and to work according to the traffic density. The traffic signal is structured with the camera which takes the snap of the road and the density is identified. Hence by this method the traffic is analyzed and the lights are transferred according to the traffic density. The number of objects present in the roads will be identified and those numbers are transmitted to the micro controller. The micro controller controls the traffic signal and the varied time is displayed in the 7 segment display. By this a dynamic approach is being followed to minimize the traffic delay and effectively commute even in heavy traffic scenarios. The primary aim is to eliminate waiting time, during peak hours. Some added advantage that are to be implemented are dealing at the time of unusual situation such as emergency vehicles like ambulances, patrol vehicles, fire engines etc., Time is varied in propotional to the traffic density. Using this model will eliminate unwanted waiting time in peak traffic hours. Single camera is used in determining density of the traffic which will reduce the cost of implementing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of efficient automatic traffic surveillance using digital image processing","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238419","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","pdfPath":"/iel7/7203316/7238030/07238419.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238030","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238419","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of efficient automatic traffic surveillance using digital image processing","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238419/","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15435623","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of efficient automatic traffic surveillance using digital image processing","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1400287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0529S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7203316","isNumber":"7238030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7203316","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7238030","articleId":"7238419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238422,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It reduces the required number of samples for signal representation at much lower rate than Nyquist's rate. High speed applications require high sampling rate that overburdens the role of ADC in signal processing. So in such cases compressive sensing plays a major role for improvement of performance. The work is based on music signal (non-speech audio signal) by iterating on various combinations of the sensing matrix and basis matrix to find the best suited for desired application. One of the sensing matrix provides the best incoherence and Restricted Isometric Property (RIP) for a particular basis matrix. This combination gives an optimum value of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). In order to have faithful recovery, it is necessary to fulfill certain properties that require a perfect combination of basis matrix and sensing matrix. This has also analyzed in the paper.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238453","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","pdfPath":"/iel7/7203316/7238030/07238453.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative analysis of basis & measurement matrices for non-speech audio signal using compressive sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238453","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238453/","displayDocTitle":"Comparative analysis of basis & measurement matrices for non-speech audio signal using compressive sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15435494","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238453/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative analysis of basis & measurement matrices for non-speech audio signal using compressive sensing","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1400342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046876S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7203316","isNumber":"7238030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7203316","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7238030","articleId":"7238453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238465,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The PA exhibits certain desirable characteristics such as enormous output Power, reduced heat dissipation, nominal input and output return loss and eminent gain. It is necessary to cut down Power consumption of PA, since PA depletes majority of Power at the transmitter. A two stage cascode topology based 0.18\u03bcm Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) PA with driver and power stages has been designed using Agilent Advanced Design System (ADS 2009) simulation tool. Here PA needs dc power supply of 1.8V and designed to operate at 2.4 GHz. Current mirror biasing is used at both the stages. The circuit uses source degeneration for input matching and tank circuit for output matching. Interstage matching is provided by a capacitor.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits","Topology","Radio frequency","Impedance matching","Gain","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","CMOS integrated circuits","current mirrors","LC circuits","power consumption","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio frequency power amplifier","RF transmitter","low power RF signal","high power signal","power consumption","two stage cascode topology","complementary metal oxide semiconductor PA","CMOS PA","driver stages","power stages","Agilent Advanced Design System simulation tool","ADS 2009 simulation tool","current mirror biasing","source degeneration","input matching","tank circuit","output matching","interstage matching","capacitor","frequency 2.4 GHz","voltage 1.8 V","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radio Frequency","Power Amplifier","return loss","Power Consumption","source degeneration","Current mirror"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238465","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","pdfPath":"/iel7/7203316/7238030/07238465.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238465","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of cascode topology based CMOS power amplifier for wireless applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of cascode topology based CMOS power amplifier for wireless applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238465/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238465/","accessionNumber":"15435545","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of cascode topology based CMOS power amplifier for wireless applications","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1400405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038433S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7203316","isNumber":"7238030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7203316","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7238030","articleId":"7238465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7238482,"authors":[{"name":"Shaik Sardar","affiliation":["SENSE, VIT University, Vellore, India"],"firstName":"Shaik","lastName":"Sardar","id":"37085574586"},{"name":"N.

There arises a need that Video Streaming users must have the capability to deliver video content quickly without downloading the entire content. In order to ensure the Quality of Service, adaptive encoding is performed at the cloud server to meet the requirements of the mobile device. To address the mentioned issues, the proposed system provides continuous streaming of videos according to the current status of the mobile device and latency of the network. To achieve continuous streaming of video, the sliding window protocol and standard H.264 encoding technique are utilized. The sliding window protocol is used to predict the bandwidth and standard H.264 encoding technique is adopted to perform adaptive streaming.

To achieve higher error correcting capability, a system is required that has high error detecting and correcting ability, with toleration to relatively high soft error rates. Also it requires sparse encoding, decoding and checker circuits, So that they can be synthesized using simple Nano scale hardware. In this paper the comparison is made using Belief Propagation Algorithm which is applied on Bipartite Graphs which are the MRFs.","doi":"10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238542","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238542","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","pdfPath":"/iel7/7203316/7238030/07238542.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis on the applications of Markov random fields in error correcting codes of nano memory cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An analysis on the applications of Markov random fields in error correcting codes of nano memory cells","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238542/","accessionNumber":"15435381","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238542/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis on the applications of Markov random fields in error correcting codes of nano memory cells","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"ICCIC1400615.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040589S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7203316","isNumber":"7238030","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7203316","xplore-issue":"7238030","articleId":"7238542","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238570,"authors":[{"name":"Sirikarn Pukkawanna","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Sirikarn","lastName":"Pukkawanna","id":"37299280300"},{"name":"Youki Kadobayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Youki","lastName":"Kadobayashi","id":"37274144600"},{"name":"Suguru Yamaguchi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Suguru","lastName":"Yamaguchi","id":"37274802900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7468-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7467-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7238570","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ports (Computers)","Histograms","Ash","Detectors","IP networks","Computer crime","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security of data","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-world backbone traffic","synthetic mimicry anomalies","time intervals","port pair distribution","statistical traffic feature","legitimate traffic","anomalous traffic","HTTP","Kullback-Leibler divergence","KL divergence-based method","network-based mimicry anomaly detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Statistical anomaly detection","statistical traffic feature","mimicry anomaly","distance measure","Kullback-Leibler divergence"]}],"abstract":"To evade detection by network-based anomaly detectors, sophisticated attackers are trying to make their malicious traffic resemble legitimate traffic by running attacks through ports used on a daily basis (e.g., port 80 for HTTP). This mimicry traffic is potentially neglected by detectors. In this paper, we propose a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based method for detecting anomalous traffic mimicking legitimate traffic. Our method firstly observes the port pair distribution of traffic flows, which is a novel statistical traffic feature proposed in this work. Secondly, our method computes the KL divergence between the port pair distributions of the current and previous time intervals. Our method starts to find anomalous flows when the KL divergence deviates from a specified threshold. We tested the performance of our method with traffic which was mixed by four synthetic mimicry anomalies and real-world backbone traffic. The results indicated that our method could precisely detect all synthetic anomalies. Furthermore, our method additionally revealed six real-world anomalies that were hidden in the testing backbone traffic.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-based mimicry anomaly detection using divergence measures","publicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)","doi":"10.1109/ISNCC.2015.7238570","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210261/7238567/07238570.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISNCC.2015.7238570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238567","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238570","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Network-based mimicry anomaly detection using divergence measures","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238570/","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15435734","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-based mimicry anomaly detection using divergence measures","confLoc":"Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"PID3676670.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063369S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210261","isNumber":"7238567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210261","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7238567","articleId":"7238570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238574,"authors":[{"name":"Mahammad A.

Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is a design aspect that facilitates the transmission of cognitive radio (CR) users over idle channels. In many cases, it is not preferable that CR users to be treated equally. Provisioning quality of service (QoS) to some CR users is a challenge in DSA design. In this situation, The CR user traffic is divided into high and low priority classes. Sub-channel reservation (SCR) scheme is the most traditional scheme to provide priority to CR users in admission. In this paper, a new scheme named \u201clow priority bounding\u201d (LPB) scheme is used to provide QoS for CR users. The LPB scheme provides priority by restricting the number of low priority CR users by a threshold. This scheme maintains a suitable level of service to high priority users (as provided by SCR scheme) while improve the level of service for low priority ones. So the revenue gained from LPB scheme is optimized in comparison with SCR scheme. The impact of LPB scheme in the provided QoS is evaluated in terms of blocking probability, service termination rate, and service completion rate. Simulation results are compared with SCR scheme and it shows that the LPB scheme can significantly improve the revenue gained over the traditional SCR scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ISNCC.2015.7238574","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210261/7238567/07238574.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISNCC.2015.7238574","publicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access with traffic prioritization in Cognitive Radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238574","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic spectrum access with traffic prioritization in Cognitive Radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238574/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238574/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15435741","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","conferenceDate":"13-15 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic spectrum access with traffic prioritization in Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Yasmine Hammamet, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"PID3676674.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049315S","chronDate":"13-15 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210261","isNumber":"7238567","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210261","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7238567","articleId":"7238574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7238577,"authors":[{"name":"Wojciech Kabaci\u0144ski","affiliation":["Poznan University of Technology, Chair of Communication and Computer Networks, Poland"],"firstName":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kabaci\u0144ski","id":"37938662100"},{"name":"Janusz Kleban","affiliation":["Poznan University of Technology, Chair of Communication and Computer Networks, Poland"],"firstName":"Janusz","lastName":"Kleban","id":"37392088600"},{"name":"Marek Michalski","affiliation":["Poznan University of Technology, Chair of Communication and Computer Networks, Poland"],"firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Michalski","id":"37274685400"},{"name":"Mariusz \u017bal","affiliation":["Poznan University of Technology, Chair of Communication and Computer Networks, Poland"],"firstName":"Mariusz","lastName":"\u017bal","id":"37679892800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7468-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7467-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7238577","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238577","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical switches","Multiplexing","Fabrics","Optical packet switching","Servers","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplexing levels","switching levels","traffic characteristics","large data centers","network architecture","tree network topology","optical interconnection networks","electronic switching networks","three-stage clos network","interstage links","circuit switching mode","space","wavelength","mode","strict-sense nonblocking networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data Center Network","Clos network","nonblocking conditions"]}],"abstract":"Changes in traffic characteristics impose new requirements on interconnection network in large data centers.

Due to this coexistence, several in-band crosstalk scenarios are possible. In this work, the impact of in-band crosstalk due to M-QAM interferers on the performance of PDM-QPSK and PDM-16-QAM coherent receivers at a bit rate of 100 Gbps is studied. The influence of the duty-cycle, time misalignment and phase difference between interferers and selected signal on the receiver performance is also assessed. We show that the QPSK signal with a duty-cycle of 33% is, generally, the most tolerant selected signal to in-band crosstalk and the less detrimental interferer to the coherent receiver performance. Additionally, we show that the time misalignment has a strong influence on the in-band crosstalk impact, when the duty-cycles of the interferers or selected signal are low.","doi":"10.1109/NOC.2015.7238604","publicationTitle":"2015 20th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications - (NOC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 20th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications - (NOC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219493/7238599/07238604.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOC.2015.7238604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of in-band crosstalk signals with different duty-cycles in M-QAM optical coherent receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7238604","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2015-July 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238604/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of in-band crosstalk signals with different duty-cycles in M-QAM optical coherent receivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15435764","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238604/","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of in-band crosstalk signals with different duty-cycles in M-QAM optical coherent receivers","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"NOC22.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054093S","chronDate":"June 30 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219493","isNumber":"7238599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219493","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7238599","articleId":"7238604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7238618,"authors":[{"name":"Zabib Ghassemlooy","affiliation":["Optical Communications Research Group, Northumbria University, UK"],"firstName":"Zabib","lastName":"Ghassemlooy","id":"37267374400"},{"name":"Zhen Zhan","affiliation":["BUPT, State Key Lab of Info.

We characterise the system based on the error vector magnitude (EVM), bit error rate (BER), and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We consider three modulation formats of quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and 64-QAM. The results show the effect of modulation order on the higher acceptable EVM limit that can be linked with the BER estimation process. Furthermore, the analysis of input signal power penalty for the three modulations indicates the advantage of higher order formats. We conclude that even with linear increment of the power penalty, higher orders modulation can offer a higher bandwidth without a significant difference compared to lower orders.","doi":"10.1109/NOC.2015.7238624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOC.2015.7238624","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 20th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications - (NOC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7219493/7238599/07238624.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 20th European Conference on Networks and Optical Communications - (NOC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7238599","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental analysis of EVM and BER for indoor radio-over-fibre networks using polymer optical fibre","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 30 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Experimental analysis of EVM and BER for indoor radio-over-fibre networks using polymer optical fibre","conferenceDate":"30 June-2 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7238624/","accessionNumber":"15435767","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7238624/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental analysis of EVM and BER for indoor radio-over-fibre networks using polymer optical fibre","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"NOCP1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113804S","chronDate":"June 30 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7219493","isNumber":"7238599","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7219493","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7238599","articleId":"7238624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7238662,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Current incandescent and fluorescent lamps are being replaced by the LEDs at a rapid pace. Apart from extremely high energy efficiency, the LEDs have other advantages such as longer lifespan, lower heat generation, and improved color rendering without using harmful chemicals. One additional benefit of LEDs is that they are capable of switching to different light intensity at a very fast rate. This functionality has given rise to a novel communication technology (known as visible light communication-VLC) where LED luminaires can be used for high speed data transfer. This survey provides a technology overview and review of existing literature of visible light communication and sensing. This paper provides a detailed survey of 1) visible light communication system and characteristics of its various components such as transmitter and receiver; 2) physical layer properties of visible light communication channel, modulation methods, and MIMO techniques; 3) medium access techniques; 4) system design and programmable platforms; and 5) visible light sensing and application such as indoor localization, gesture recognition, screen-camera communication, and vehicular networking. We also outline important challenges that need to be addressed in order to design high-speed mobile networks using visible light communication.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2015.2476474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2476474","startPage":"2047","endPage":"2077","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7331734/07239528.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visible Light Communication, Networking, and Sensing: A Survey, Potential and Challenges","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourthquarter  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Visible Light Communication, Networking, and Sensing: A Survey, Potential and Challenges","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15602566","publicationDate":"Fourthquarter 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7239528/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visible Light Communication, Networking, and Sensing: A Survey, Potential and Challenges","sourcePdf":"comst-pathak-2476474-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.277251S","chronDate":"Fourthquarter  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7331734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"711","xplore-issue":"7331734","articleId":"7239528","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7239530,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Zomorrodi","affiliation":["Monash University, Clayton, VIC, AU"],"bio":{"p":["Mohammad Zomorrodi (mohammad.zomorrodi@monash.edu) received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Bahonar University, Kerman, Iran, in 1995, his M.S. degree in communication engineering from the K.

The fact that mobile devices are prone to be compromised and reverse engineered significantly increases the risk of such attacks in which adversaries can obtain secret keys on trusted nodes and impersonate the legitimate node. One promising approach toward thwarting these attacks is through the extraction of unique fingerprints that can provide a reliable and robust means for device identification. These fingerprints can be extracted from transmitted signal by analyzing information across the protocol stack. In this paper, the first unified and comprehensive tutorial in the area of wireless device fingerprinting for security applications is presented. In particular, we aim to provide a detailed treatment on developing novel wireless security solutions using device fingerprinting techniques. The objectives are three-fold: (i) to introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of wireless features that can be used in fingerprinting, (ii) to provide a systematic review on fingerprint algorithms including both white-list based and unsupervised learning approaches, and (iii) to identify key open research problems in the area of device fingerprinting and feature extraction, as applied to wireless security.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239531/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2016","volume":"18","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15730374","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7239531/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Device Fingerprinting in Wireless Networks: Challenges and Opportunities","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Engineering Council of Canada under Discovery Grant"},{"fundingName":"Ontario Center of Excellence"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1524634 and CNS-1446621"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Device Fingerprinting in Wireless Networks: Challenges and Opportunities","sourcePdf":"comst-zheng-2476338-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119998S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7393921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"7393921","articleId":"7239531","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7239542,"authors":[{"name":"Robert C.

These, can be used to help address the individual fitness needs of the users and could be exploited within personalized healthcare plans. In this letter, we are concerned with the design of lightweight and efficient algorithms for the lossy compression of these signals. In fact, we underline that compression is a key functionality to improve the lifetime of IoT devices, which are often energy constrained, allowing the optimization of their internal memory space and the efficient transmission of data over their wireless interface. To this end, we advocate the use of autoencoders as an efficient and computationally lightweight means to compress biometric signals. While the presented techniques can be used with any signal showing a certain degree of periodicity, in this letter we apply them to ECG traces, showing quantitative results in terms of compression ratio, reconstruction error and computational complexity. State of the art solutions are also compared with our approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239543/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15450498","volume":"22","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7239543/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Lightweight Lossy Compression of Biometric Patterns via Denoising Autoencoders","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightweight Lossy Compression of Biometric Patterns via Denoising Autoencoders","sourcePdf":"lsp-deltesta-2476667-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086005S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7194906","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7194906","articleId":"7239543","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7239544,"authors":[{"name":"Hucheng Sun","affiliation":["Research Center of Applied Electromagnetics, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hucheng","lastName":"Sun","id":"38247649200"},{"name":"Wen Geyi","affiliation":["Research Center of Applied Electromagnetics, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Geyi","id":"37281514700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7239544","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":63,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2103},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rectennas","Rectifiers","Radio frequency","Density measurement","Antenna measurements","Power system measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","electromagnetic wave polarisation","inductive power transmission","rectennas","rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rectenna","all-polarization-receiving capability","wireless power transmission applications","dual linearly-polarized antenna","arbitrary polarization incident wave","dual-input rectifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circular polarization","linear polarization","rectennas","wireless power transmission"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents a new rectenna with all-polarization-receiving capability for wireless power transmission applications.

Modern parallelization strategies employ fine-grained operations and scheduling beyond the classic bulk-synchronous processing paradigm popularized by MapReduce, or even specialized graph-based execution that relies on graph representations of ML programs. The variety of approaches tends to pull systems and algorithms design in different directions, and it remains difficult to find a universal platform applicable to a wide range of ML programs at scale. We propose a general-purpose framework, Petuum, that systematically addresses data- and model-parallel challenges in large-scale ML, by observing that many ML programs are fundamentally optimization-centric and admit error-tolerant, iterative-convergent algorithmic solutions. This presents unique opportunities for an integrative system design, such as bounded-error network synchronization and dynamic scheduling based on ML program structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of these system designs versus well-known implementations of modern ML algorithms, showing that Petuum allows ML programs to run in much less time and at considerably larger model sizes, even on modestly-sized compute clusters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239545/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2015","volume":"1","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15663222","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"1 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7239545/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Petuum: A New Platform for Distributed Machine Learning on Big Data","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)","grantNumber":"FA87501220324"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"IIS1447676"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Petuum: A New Platform for Distributed Machine Learning on Big Data","sourcePdf":"tbdata-ho-2472014-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157194S","chronDate":"June 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687317","isNumber":"7347533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687317","citationCount":"189","xplore-issue":"7347533","articleId":"7239545","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7239547,"authors":[{"name":"Ling Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Antennas and Microwaves, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Sun","id":"37651519400"},{"name":"Baohua Sun","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Antennas and Microwaves, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Baohua","lastName":"Sun","id":"37589861800"},{"name":"Jiangpeng Yuan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Antennas and Microwaves, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jiangpeng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085641565"},{"name":"Wending Tang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Antennas and Microwaves, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wending","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085642680"},{"name":"He Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Antennas and Microwaves, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"He","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085758187"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7239547","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3723},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"A low-profile, quasi-omnidirectional substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) multihorn antenna is proposed for small nonmetallic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications.

In this paper, two novel PM tubular machines named partitioned stator interior PM (PS-IPM) and partitioned stator surface-mounted PM (PS-SPM) tubular machines are proposed. Both the proposed machines are optimized for maximum thrust force, and their electromagnetic performance has been compared. It is found that the PS-IPM tubular machine has higher thrust force capability and better magnet utilization compared with the PS-SPM tubular machine. However, due to lower cogging force, the PS-SPM tubular machine has fewer thrust force ripples. Furthermore, the effect of the cross-coupling magnetic saturation on PM flux linkage, and the d-axis and q-axis inductances for both the proposed machines is investigated. It is demonstrated that the PM flux linkage and the d-axis and q-axis inductances are affected by the cross-coupling magnetic saturation. Moreover, the force-velocity characteristics of the proposed machines are calculated and compared. It is observed that both the machines have good constant power operation capability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239571/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","volume":"52","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15669125","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7239571/","isJournal":true,"externalId":"9500207","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Study of Novel Tubular Partitioned Stator Permanent Magnet Machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Study of Novel Tubular Partitioned Stator Permanent Magnet Machines","sourcePdf":"tmag-zhu-2476558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061624S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7360963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7360963","articleId":"7239571","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7239586,"authors":[{"name":"Sindri Magn\u00fasson","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering School, Access Linnaeus Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6509490/7569111/7239586/magnu-2476198-small.gif","p":["\nSindri Magn\u00fasson received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from \nthe University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland, in 2011, the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from KTH Royal Institute of \nTechnology, Stockholm Sweden, in 2013, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in aomatic control at the School of \nElectrical Engineering and ACCESS Linnaeus Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology.","He has held a six-month visiting research position at Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, USA, in 2015, sponsored by \nthe Engblom Foundation.

The study of the convergence properties of these methods is, in general, difficult due to the nonconvexity of the problem. In this paper, two distributed solution methods that combine the fast convergence properties of augmented Lagrangian-based methods with the separability properties of alternating optimization are investigated. The first method is adapted from the classic quadratic penalty function method and is called the alternating direction penalty method (ADPM). Unlike the original quadratic penalty function method, where single-step optimizations are adopted, ADPM uses an alternating optimization which, in turn, makes it scalable. The second method is the well-known alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). It is shown that ADPM for nonconvex problems asymptotically converges to a primal feasible point under mild conditions and an additional condition ensuring that it asymptotically reaches the standard first-order necessary conditions for local optimality is introduced. In the case of the ADMM, novel sufficient conditions under which the algorithm asymptotically reaches the standard first-order necessary conditions are established. Based on this, complete convergence of the ADMM for a class of low-dimensional problems is characterized. Finally, the results are illustrated by applying ADPM and ADMM to a nonconvex localization problem in wireless-sensor networks.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCNS.2015.2476198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7569111","startPage":"296","endPage":"309","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6509490/7569111/07239586.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Convergence of Alternating Direction Lagrangian Methods for Nonconvex Structured Optimization Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7239586/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Convergence of Alternating Direction Lagrangian Methods for Nonconvex Structured Optimization Problems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16316677","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"3","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"VR Chromos Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Convergence of Alternating Direction Lagrangian Methods for Nonconvex Structured Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"tcns-magnusson-2476198-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133325S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6509490","isNumber":"7569111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6509490","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7569111","articleId":"7239586","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7239593,"authors":[{"name":"Yuchuan Qiao","affiliation":["Division of Image Processing, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherland"],"firstName":"Yuchuan","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37085695802"},{"name":"Baldur van Lew","affiliation":["Division of Image Processing, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherland"],"firstName":"Baldur","lastName":"van Lew","id":"37085696562"},{"name":"Boudewijn P.

However, due to the large number of voxels in an image and the complexity of registration algorithms, this process is often very slow. Stochastic gradient descent is a powerful method to iteratively solve the registration problem, but relies for convergence on a proper selection of the optimization step size. This selection is difficult to perform manually, since it depends on the input data, similarity measure and transformation model. The Adaptive Stochastic Gradient Descent (ASGD) method is an automatic approach, but it comes at a high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new computationally efficient method (fast ASGD) to automatically determine the step size for gradient descent methods, by considering the observed distribution of the voxel displacements between iterations. A relation between the step size and the expectation and variance of the observed distribution is derived. While ASGD has quadratic complexity with respect to the transformation parameters, fast ASGD only has linear complexity. Extensive validation has been performed on different datasets with different modalities, inter/intra subjects, different similarity measures and transformation models. For all experiments, we obtained similar accuracy as ASGD. Moreover, the estimation time of fast ASGD is reduced to a very small value, from 40 s to less than 1 s when the number of parameters is 105, almost 40 times faster. Depending on the registration settings, the total registration time is reduced by a factor of 2.5-7 \u00d7 for the experiments in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2015.2476354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2015.2476354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/7396977/07239593.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7396977","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239593/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Fast Automatic Step Size Estimation for Gradient Descent Optimization of Image Registration","volume":"35","issue":"2","pubMedId":"26353367","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15755158","htmlLink":"/document/7239593/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2016","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Dutch national e infrastructure with the support of the SURF Foundation","grantNumber":"e\u00adinfra140085"},{"fundingName":"the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research","grantNumber":"NWO VENI 639.021.919"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council","grantNumber":"No. 201206130066"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Fast Automatic Step Size Estimation for Gradient Descent Optimization of Image Registration","sourcePdf":"tmi-qiao-2476354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103903S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7396977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7396977","articleId":"7239593","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7239600,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Huang","affiliation":["Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing (CRIPAC), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/7302100/7239600/7239600-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Huang received the B.Sc. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2012, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), Beijing, China.","His research interests include machine learning and pattern recognition."]},"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Huang","id":"38548569600"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing (CRIPAC), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/7302100/7239600/7239600-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Wei Wang received the B.E. degree from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in information science and engineering from the Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (GUCAS), Beijing, China, in 2011.","Since July 2011, he has been an Assistant Professor with NLPR, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

In this paper, we consider a more general problem where the labels contain dependency relationships and some modalities are likely to be missing. To this end, we propose a multi-label conditional restricted Boltzmann machine (ML-CRBM), which handles modality completion , fusion, and multi-label prediction in a unified framework. The proposed model is able to generate missing modalities based on observed ones, by explicitly modelling and sampling their conditional distributions. After that, it can discriminatively fuse multiple modalities to obtain shared representations under the supervision of class labels. To consider the co-occurrence of the labels, the proposed model formulates the multi-label prediction as a max-margin-based multi-task learning problem. Model parameters can be jointly learned by seeking a balance between being generative for modality generation and being discriminative for label prediction. We perform a series of experiments in terms of classification, visualization, and retrieval, and the experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239600/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","volume":"17","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15553483","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7239600/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Unconstrained Multimodal Multi-Label Learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unconstrained Multimodal Multi-Label Learning","sourcePdf":"tmm-huang-2476658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089144S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7302100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7302100","articleId":"7239600","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":7239607,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-Jun Liu","affiliation":["College of Science, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7360252/7239607/liu-2471262-small.gif","p":["Yan-Jun Liu (M\u201915) received the B.S. degree in applied mathematics and the M.S. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Shenyang University of Technology, Shenyang, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2007.","He is currently a Professor with the College of Science, Liaoning University of Technology, Jinzhou, China.

Different from linear dead zone, the dead zone, in this paper, is a kind of nonlinear dead zone. To overcome the noncausal problem, which leads to the control scheme infeasible, the systems can be transformed into a $m$ -step-ahead predictor. Due to nonlinear dead-zone appearance, the transformed predictor still contains the nonaffine function. In addition, it is assumed that the gain function of dead-zone input and the control direction are unknown. These conditions bring about the difficulties and the complicacy in the controller design. Thus, the implicit function theorem is applied to deal with nonaffine dead-zone appearance, the problem caused by the unknown control direction can be resolved through applying the discrete Nussbaum gain, and the neural networks are used to approximate the unknown function. Based on the Lyapunov theory, all the signals of the resulting closed-loop system are proved to be semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded. Moreover, the tracking error is proved to be regulated to a small neighborhood around zero. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by a simulation example.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7360252/07239607.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2471262","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2471262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7360252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7239607","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Approach to Adaptive Neural Control for Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems With Nonlinear Dead-Zone Input","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete-time systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Artificial neural networks","Approximation methods","Adaptive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","discrete time systems","function approximation","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking error","semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded closed-loop system","Lyapunov theory","unknown function approximation","neural networks","discrete Nussbaum gain","nonaffine dead-zone appearance","implicit function theorem","controller design","m-step-ahead predictor","noncausal problem","unknown control direction","unknown dead-zone input","nonlinear discrete-time system stabilization","nonlinear dead-zone input","adaptive neural control","unified approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","discrete Nussbaum gain","discrete-time systems","unknown control direction."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics","Time Factors"]},{"kwd":["Adaptive control","discrete Nussbaum gain","discrete-time systems","unknown control direction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239607/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Approach to Adaptive Neural Control for Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems With Nonlinear Dead-Zone Input","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7239607/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15669232","pubMedId":"26353383","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61374113, 61473139 and 61572540"},{"fundingName":"Program for Liaoning Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"LR2014016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Approach to Adaptive Neural Control for Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems With Nonlinear Dead-Zone Input","sourcePdf":"tnnls-liu-2471262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114615S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7360252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"7360252","articleId":"7239607","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":7239612,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Won Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7374779/7239612/cho-small.gif","p":["Yong-Won Cho was born in Daegu, Korea, in 1983.

The proposed DAB inverter consists of a DAB dc-dc converter and a synchronous rectifier (SR) for unfolding. The DAB dc-dc converter transforms the low dc voltage into a rectified sine wave that pulsates twice the grid frequency. The rectified sine wave unfolds into the grid voltage by SR. The proposed hybrid modulation combines a phase shift control and a variable frequency control. The variable frequency control converts the nonlinear function of the phase shift angle into a linear function and controls the output power. This leads to a simple closed-loop control for the sinusoidal current waveform, a low harmonic distortion, and a high-voltage conversion ratio without an increase of the transformer turn ratio. Since the proposed DAB inverter has only a single power conversion stage, it has a simple structure, high power density, and low cost. It also has a high efficiency of 94.2% by a zero-voltage switching (ZVS) turn on of the switches in two full bridges (FBs). The operation principle of the proposed DAB inverter using this hybrid modulation is analyzed and verified. Experimental results for a 1-kW prototype are obtained to show the performance.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2476336","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7374779/07239612.pdf","startPage":"4138","endPage":"4147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2476336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Efficiency Bidirectional DAB Inverter Using a Novel Hybrid Modulation for Stand-Alone Power Generating System With Low Input Voltage","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7239612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239612/","displayDocTitle":"High-Efficiency Bidirectional DAB Inverter Using a Novel Hybrid Modulation for Stand-Alone Power Generating System With Low Input Voltage","volume":"31","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15697269","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7239612/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Efficiency Bidirectional DAB Inverter Using a Novel Hybrid Modulation for Stand-Alone Power Generating System With Low Input Voltage","sourcePdf":"tpel-kwon-2476336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06789S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7374779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7374779","articleId":"7239612","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7239616,"authors":[{"name":"Pengyu Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Informatization, China Center for Informatization Industry Development, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7239616/liu-2476382-small.gif","p":["\n\nPengyu Liu (S'13) was born in Zhengzhou, China.

Real-time communications between on- and under-overpass vehicles can contribute to effective vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, including, for example, optimal route selection and overpass accident warning messaging. Ensuring effective communication requires a quantitative characterization of the overpass propagation channel. In this paper, we provide measurement and analytical results for V2V propagation path loss and root-mean-square delay spread, and from these results, we develop tapped-delay line channel models that are applicable to the 5-GHz band for two example overpasses. These two example overpasses are termed i) one-lane metal-bottom overpass and ii) two-lane metal-bottom overpass. Due to the unique structure of the overpasses, we divide the radio propagation space around the overpass into four different areas: a two-ray area, a short-term partial-shadowing area, a (full) shadowing area, and a long-term partial-shadowing area. In the two-ray area, a line-of-sight (LOS) path and a ground-reflected path are the dominant propagation mechanisms, whereas in the other areas, the overpass body (floor, walls, and columns) attenuates the LOS signal. The accuracy of our measurement results and the developed channel model are verified by a geometry-based stochastic channel modeling approach, in which the height dimension is first introduced to characterize the diffraction phenomenon in V2V communication. The actual measurement and simulation results show good consistency.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shadow mapping","Diffraction","Vehicles","Roads","Propagation losses","Loss measurement","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay lines","radiowave propagation","stochastic processes","vehicular ad hoc networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle-to-vehicle channel characterization","special over-road structure","overpass channel","vehicular travel","roadway intersection","real-time communication","under-overpass vehicles","on-overpass vehicles","V2V propagation path loss","root-mean-square delay spread","tapped-delay line channel model","one-lane metal-bottom overpass","two-lane metal-bottom overpass","radio propagation space","line-of-sight path","LOS signal attenuation","geometry-based stochastic channel modeling approach","diffraction phenomenon","frequency 5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay spread","overpass channels","path loss","vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2476382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07239616.pdf","startPage":"5862","endPage":"5873","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2476382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"5-GHz Vehicle-to-Vehicle Channel Characterization for Example Overpass Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7239616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"5-GHz Vehicle-to-Vehicle Channel Characterization for Example Overpass Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239616/","volume":"65","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7239616/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16209985","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61222105"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1334202"},{"fundingName":"Key Grant Project of Chinese Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"313006"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"5-GHz Vehicle-to-Vehicle Channel Characterization for Example Overpass Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-liu-2476382-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095252S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7239616","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7239618,"authors":[{"name":"Venkata Anand Kishore Prabhala","affiliation":["International Rectifier, An Infineon Technologies Company, El Segundo, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7374779/7239618/prabh-small.gif","p":["Venkata Anand Kishore Prabhala (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree\n from the National Institute of Technology, Warangal, India, in 2005, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Missouri\n University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA, in 2010 and 2014, respectively.","From 2005 to 2008, he was a Project Engineer at Larsen & Toubro Ltd., India.

The scenario is selected as crossing traffic on urban intersections. The 2 \u00d7 2 channel measurements with a wideband channel sounder are employed for the correlation analysis, and in parallel, the same scenario is simulated with a ray-tracing tool for the analysis of the angular domain. We introduce measures and tools to describe the relevant characteristics and the performance; the limitations of the ray-tracing simulation are also subdued to critical evaluation. The focus of this paper is set on the evaluation of the presented method on one selected experiment (combination of measurement and ray-tracing simulation) rather than on an exhaustive statistical analysis of many scenarios. The combination lies in the higher level of analyzing the MIMO characteristics of the channel using two different methods. The results provide that the MIMO channels show a similar power level in terms of mean MPC power, but the linear correlation stays relatively low. Specifically, discrete MPCs tend to be more highly correlated than diffuse MPCs. Furthermore, the angular spread is highly dynamic but small and substantially increases when both vehicles are near the center of the intersection. Significant power contributions caused by buildings along the roadside are identified.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2476512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07239623.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2476512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","startPage":"5874","endPage":"5886","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of MPC Correlation and Angular Characteristics in the Vehicular Urban Intersection Channel Using Channel Sounding and Ray Tracing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7239623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of MPC Correlation and Angular Characteristics in the Vehicular Urban Intersection Channel Using Channel Sounding and Ray Tracing","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239623/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16209989","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7239623/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Technologie (Federal Department of Commerce and Technology)","grantNumber":"BMWi 19S9024E"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of MPC Correlation and Angular Characteristics in the Vehicular Urban Intersection Channel Using Channel Sounding and Ray Tracing","sourcePdf":"tvt-paschalidis-2476512-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143316S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7239623","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7239624,"authors":[{"name":"Srivatsan Ramarathnam","affiliation":["Chrysler India Automotive Pvt.

They require a wide speed range and high efficiency along with high power density and mechanical robustness. Traction motors and their drives are also expected to deliver superior performance throughout the lifetime of the vehicle. Considering the extreme loading conditions, the motors should be designed for very strict thermal requirements. Therefore, all electromagnetic, mechanical, and thermal variables must be thoroughly addressed in motor design. In this review paper, a summary of current structural and thermal simulation methods applicable for traction motors is presented. Prominent design issues along with appropriate analysis methodologies are explained. In addition, briefcase studies of electromagnetic, structural, and thermal analysis performed at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) US LLC are highlighted. A detailed list of references and an analysis road map are also provided to aid practicing engineers and researchers involved in electric machine design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239624/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"1","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15552447","htmlLink":"/document/7239624/","displayDocTitle":"A Review of Structural and Thermal Analysis of Traction Motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Review of Structural and Thermal Analysis of Traction Motors","sourcePdf":"tte-bilgin-2476478-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086331S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6687316","isNumber":"7299736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6687316","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7299736","articleId":"7239624","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7239628,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwen Ma","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7469897/7239628/ma-2470635-small.gif","p":["Hongwen Ma (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electric engineering and automation from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2012.

Base stations (BSs) equipped with large-scale antennas can serve multiple users simultaneously by exploiting the downlink precoding in time division duplex (TDD) mode. However, channel state information (CSI) of uplink transmissions cannot be simply used for downlink precoding, because the gain mismatches of the transceiver radio frequency (RF) circuits disable the channel reciprocity. In this paper, we focus on antenna calibration for massive MIMO systems with maximal ratio transmit (MRT) precoding to solve the channel nonreciprocity problem. A new calibration method, called mutual coupling calibration, is proposed by using the effect of mutual coupling between adjacent antennas. By exploiting this method, the BS can perform the calibration without extra hardware circuit and users' involvement. We also build up the model of calibration error and derive the closed-form expressions of the ergodic sum-rates for evaluating the impact of calibration error on system performance. Simulation results verify the high calibration accuracy of the proposed method and show the significant improvement of system performance by performing antenna calibration.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07239634.pdf","startPage":"606","endPage":"619","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2476467","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2476467","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7239634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual Coupling Calibration for Multiuser Massive MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","Radio frequency","Antennas","MIMO","Mutual coupling","Downlink","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","next generation networks","precoding","telecommunication links","time division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mutual coupling calibration","massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","multiuser massive MIMO systems","next generation mobile communication systems","base stations","large-scale antennas","downlink precoding","time division duplex mode","TDD mode","channel state information","CSI","radio frequency circuits","channel reciprocity","antenna calibration","maximal ratio transmit precoding","MRT precoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna calibration","mutual coupling","channel reciprocity","massive MIMO"]},{"kwd":["Antenna calibration","mutual coupling","channel reciprocity","massive MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239634/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mutual Coupling Calibration for Multiuser Massive MIMO Systems","volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7239634/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697434","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB336600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61221002 and 61271205"},{"fundingName":"China High-Tech","grantNumber":"2014AA01A706"},{"fundingName":"Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province Plans to Graduate Research and Innovation","grantNumber":"KYLX15_0075"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual Coupling Calibration for Multiuser Massive MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-wang-2476467-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097467S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7239634","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7239638,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunbae Lee","affiliation":["SK hynix, Icheon city, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7307914/7239638/7239638-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyunbae Lee (M\u201910) received the B.S. degree from Physics, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1999, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, POSTECH, Kyungbuk, Korea, in 2001 and 2006, respectively","From 2006 to 2010, he was a Senior Engineer at Samsung Electronics, Hwasung, Korea, performing research and development in the field of Computing DRAM circuits.","He joined SK hynix, Icheon, Korea, in 2011, where he is currently a Senior Engineer in the Interface design team, and he was a leader of SERDES research group from 2011 to 2013.

A transmitter, receiver, and channel are all included in a single package as SiP. A current mode 4:1 MUX with 1-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) is used as a serializer, and this 4:1 MUX uses 25% duty clock to prevent short circuit current when consecutive 2-phase clocks overlap. Additionally, an open drain output driver with asynchronous type 1-tap FFE is used in the transmitter. Because of its small physical size, a common mode variation of Si-carrier channel from process variation is more serious than that of conventional PCB. This common mode variation degrades bit error rates (BER) at single-ended signaling. To obtain effective single-ended signaling on Si-carrier channel, a source follower-based continuous time linear equalizers and self- VREF generator with training algorithm on the receiver are proposed. An implemented Si-carrier channel uses meshed layer as a reference to reduce insertion loss. A BER less than 1e-12 is achieved in 65 nm CMOS and the power efficiency of the transceiver is 5.9 pJ/bit with 120 \u03a9 terminations at each transceiver side.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7307914/07239638.pdf","startPage":"2613","endPage":"2624","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 16.8 Gbps/Channel Single-Ended Transceiver in 65 nm CMOS for SiP-Based DRAM Interface on Si-Carrier Channel","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2015.2466469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2015.2466469","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7239638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A 16.8 Gbps/Channel Single-Ended Transceiver in 65 nm CMOS for SiP-Based DRAM Interface on Si-Carrier Channel","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15557940","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"50","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7239638/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 16.8 Gbps/Channel Single-Ended Transceiver in 65 nm CMOS for SiP-Based DRAM Interface on Si-Carrier Channel","sourcePdf":"jssc-lee-2466469-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083939S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7307914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7307914","articleId":"7239638","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7239646,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadhassan Akbarpour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7287831/7239646/7239646-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammadhassan Akbarpour (S\u201910) received the M.Sc. degree in microwave and optics engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada, in 2015.","He is currently with the Intelligent RF Radio Laboratory (iRadio Lab), University of Calgary.

The proposed architecture uses novel three-port network as the output matching/combining network (OMCN). The three-port OMCN performs the power combining for any arbitrary output power ratios from the two transistors of the Doherty amplifier. It also performs the impedance matching from any arbitrary complex load impedance to the optimum impedances for both transistors at peak output power. Commonly in Doherty amplifiers, an optimum performance at peak power and a sub-optimum performance at power back-off are often obtained. Using the proposed output network, optimum performance can be reached at power back-off, as well as at peak power. Another three-port network is proposed for input matching/dividing network (IMDN) at the input of the proposed Doherty amplifier. The three-port IMDN is designed to perform the power division with any arbitrary division ratio, adjust the arbitrary phase difference between the input signals to the two transistors, and provide the impedance matching from any arbitrary complex source impedance to the optimal source impedances for the two transistors. To verify the provided theory, two prototype amplifiers are designed and tested. A 12-W amplifier is designed for a 50-\u03a9 source and load impedances at 1 GHz. Another 12-W amplifier is designed at 1 GHz for complex source and load impedances. Both amplifiers have efficiency of higher than 50% at 7-dB output power range.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239646/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7239646/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15488879","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Design Methodology for Generic Doherty Amplifier Architectures Using Three-Port Input/Output Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Design Methodology for Generic Doherty Amplifier Architectures Using Three-Port Input/Output Networks","sourcePdf":"tmtt-akbarpour-2471297-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121151S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7287831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7287831","articleId":"7239646","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7239650,"authors":[{"name":"Heungjae Choi","affiliation":["Cardiff University, School of Engineering, Cardiff, Wales, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7287831/7239650/7239650-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Heungjae Choi (S\u201906\u2013M\u201911) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D degrees in electronic engineering from Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Korea, in 2004, 2006, and 2011, respectively.","From 2006 to 2011, he served his alternative military service as a Specialty Research Worker.

The novelty of the proposed sensor is that it comprises two spatially separated split-ring resonators, where one interacts with the change in glucose level of a sample under test while the other ring is used as a reference. The reference ring has a slightly different resonant frequency and is desensitized to the sample owing to its location, thus allowing changes in temperature to be calibrated out. From an oral glucose tolerance test with two additional commercially available sensors (blood strip and continuous glucose monitor) in parallel, we obtained encouraging performance for our sensor comparable with those of the commercial sensors. The effects of endogenous interferents common to all subjects, i.e., common sugars, vitamins (ascorbic acid), and metabolites (uric acid) have also been investigated by using a large Franz cell assembly. From the interference test, it is shown that the change in sensor response is dominated by changes in glucose level for concentrations relevant to blood, and the effects of interferents are negligible in comparison.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and In Vitro Interference Test of Microwave Noninvasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Sensor","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2015.2472019","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7287831/07239650.pdf","startPage":"3016","endPage":"3025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2015.2472019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287831","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7239650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7239650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"03 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Design and In Vitro Interference Test of Microwave Noninvasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Sensor","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7239650/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15488862","pubMedId":"26568639","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Design and In Vitro Interference Test of Microwave Noninvasive Blood Glucose Monitoring Sensor","sourcePdf":"tmtt-choi-2472019-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083535S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7287831","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"7287831","articleId":"7239650","onlineDate":"03 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"}]
