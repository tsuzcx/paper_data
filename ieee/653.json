The static and dynamic network models for the heat exchanger were developed in a Matlab\u00ae environment. The performances of the models were assessed through statistical validity by using the correlation coefficient and the means square error.

As a result, Intercarrier Interference Self-Cancellation (ICI-SC) has been applied in numerous OFDM systems as a simple and impressive approach to overcome ICI. ICI not only diminish yet maximum frequency diversity can also be achieved by manipulating the Space Time Frequency Block Codes (STFBCs) that use spatial, time and frequency diversities which is implemented in the OFDM system. Hence, the objective of this paper is to evaluate Pair-Wise Error Probability (PEP) performance using STFBC MIMO-OFDM ICI-SC technique with a novel quarter subcarrier mapping (new) data conversion method to diminish ICI due to FO. The simulation results expressively show that the quarter method subcarrier mapping technique can provide the best system performance compared to the symmetric and adjacent methods. Hence, by using this suggested technique, maximum diversity order with an efficient bandwidth can be achieved and ICI can be reduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Colloquium on Signal Processing and its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523355/6529997/06530027.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"128","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Colloquium on Signal Processing and its Applications","doi":"10.1109/CSPA.2013.6530027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSPA.2013.6530027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6529997","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6530027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Pair-Wise Error Probability (PEP) performance using quarter subcarrier mapping technique in MIMO-OFDM system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Equations","Mathematical model","System performance","Interference","Receiving antennas","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","intercarrier interference","interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pair-wise error probability","PEP performance","quarter subcarrier mapping technique","MIMO-OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing communication system","frequency offsets","subcarrier orthogonality","intercarrier interference self-cancellation","maximum frequency diversity","space time frequency block codes","spatial diversity","time diversity","STFBC MIMO-OFDM ICI-SC technique","quarter subcarrier mapping data conversion method","symmetric method","adjacent method","maximum diversity order"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PEP (Pair-Wise Error Probability)","ICI-SC (Intercarrier Interference Self-Cancellation)","STFBC (Space Time Frequency Block Code)","FO(frequency offsets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 March 2013","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Pair-Wise Error Probability (PEP) performance using quarter subcarrier mapping technique in MIMO-OFDM system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6530027/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13580366","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","conferenceDate":"8-10 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Pair-Wise Error Probability (PEP) performance using quarter subcarrier mapping technique in MIMO-OFDM system","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0025ID53.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060897S","chronDate":"8-10 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523355","isNumber":"6529997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523355","xplore-issue":"6529997","articleId":"6530027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6530035,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Improvement in performance is achieved using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) method with Fourier dictionary at low signal to noise ratio (SNR). OMP is an iterative and fast reconstruction method while Fourier dictionary is used to transform the original signal from time domain to Fourier domain. A significant reduction of sampling frequency by a factor of 360 is achieved at SNR as low as 10 dB, while preserving essential signal information. Low signal reconstruction error leads to good detection performance using Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT), a detector based on ratio of probabilities of detection and false alarm. Simulation results demonstrate usefulness of the ideas presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Colloquium on Signal Processing and its

Neural Network and Extended Kalman Filter hybrid model of flood prediction system","abstract":"Accurate prediction of flood water level is a difficult task to achieve due to the nonlinearity of the water level itself and lacking of input parameters to the neural network model. Although Artificial Neural Network is proven to be the best model of flood water level prediction, suitable model parameters need to be chosen for training purposes in order to arrive to an optimal model with smallest error. A new Back Propagation Neural Network model (BPN) for the prediction of flood water level 3 hours ahead of time is developed in this study. This optimized BPN model offers advantages of parameter analysis method instead of trial and error method for choosing the optimized BPN model parameters. However, the simulated results of BPN model required improvement as the model could not able to track the actual water level precisely. Hence, this paper proposes BPN model with integration of EKF at the output. Performance indices result such as Akaike's Final Prediction Error(FPE), Loss Function(V) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from this hybrid model outperform the BPN model result.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530051/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13580390","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6530051/","publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","conferenceDate":"8-10 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New Artificial Neural Network and Extended Kalman Filter hybrid model of flood prediction system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Artificial Neural Network and Extended Kalman Filter hybrid model of flood prediction system","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0049ID103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051656S","chronDate":"8-10 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523355","isNumber":"6529997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523355","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6529997","articleId":"6530051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6530055,"authors":[{"name":"Vinay Kumar Pamula","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University College of Engineering, JNTUK, Kakinada, India"],"firstName":"Vinay Kumar","lastName":"Pamula","id":"38622554700"},{"name":"Habibulla Khan","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Anurag College of Engineering, Kodad, India"],"firstName":"Habibulla","lastName":"Khan","id":"38197392000"},{"name":"Srinivasa Rao Vempati","affiliation":["Department of ECE, KL University, Vaddeswaram, India"],"firstName":"Srinivasa Rao","lastName":"Vempati","id":"37401630900"},{"name":"Anil Kumar Tipparti","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Anurag College of Engineering, Aushapur, India"],"firstName":"Anil Kumar","lastName":"Tipparti","id":"38659581000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5609-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5608-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-5607-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6530055","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Fading","Multiuser detection","Multiaccess communication","Noise","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","decorrelation","demodulation","differential phase shift keying","estimation theory","evolutionary computation","impulse noise","minimisation","multiuser detection","Nakagami channels","particle swarm optimisation","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-CDMA system","Nakagami-m fading channel","robust multiuser detection technique","direct sequence-code division multiple access system","impulsive noise","robust M-decorrelating detector","noncoherent DPSK signal demodulation","PSO","particle swarm optimization algorithm","objective function minimization","evolutionary behavior","modified-Hampel based M-estimator","linear decorrelating detector","Huber estimator based detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDMA","influence function","maximal ratio combiner","M-estimator","multiuser detection","Nakagami fading","particle swarm optimization"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a robust multiuser detection technique for direct sequence-code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems over Nakgami-m fading channels in the presence of impulsive noise.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) reflects the internal emotional state changes of the subject compared to other conventional methods (face recognition, gestures, speech, etc). In this work, EEG signals are collected using 62 channels from 20 subjects in the age group of 21~39 years for determining discrete emotions. Audio-visual stimuli (video clips) is used for inducing five different emotions (happy, surprise, fear, disgust, neutral). EEG signals are preprocessed through Butterworth 4\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n order filter with a cut off frequency of 0.5 Hz-60 Hz and smoothened using Surface Laplacian filter. EEG signals are framed into a short time duration of 5s and two statistical features (spectral centroid and spectral entropy) in four frequency bands namely alpha (8 Hz-16 Hz), beta (16 Hz-32 Hz), gamma (32 Hz-60 Hz) and alpha to gamma (8 Hz-60 Hz) are extracted using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). These features are mapped into the corresponding emotions using two simple classifiers such as K Nearest Neighbor(KNN) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). In this work, KNN outperforms PNN by offering the maximum mean classification accuracy of 91.33 % on beta band. This experimental results indicates the short time duration of EEG signals is highly essential for detecting the emotional state changes of the subjects.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Colloquium on Signal Processing and its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523355/6529997/06530058.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Colloquium on Signal Processing and its Applications","doi":"10.1109/CSPA.2013.6530058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSPA.2013.6530058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6529997","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6530058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Human emotion recognition through short time Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Emotion recognition","Feature extraction","Entropy","Fast Fourier transforms","Signal processing","Laplace equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology computing","electroencephalography","emotion recognition","fast Fourier transforms","neural nets","pattern recognition","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human emotion recognition","electroencephalogram signal","EEG signal","fast Fourier transform","FFT","psychology","psychophysiology","human machine interface","HMI design","internal emotional state","face recognition","gestures","speech","discrete emotion","audio-visual stimuli","video clips","Butterworth","cut off frequency","surface Laplacian filter","spectral centroid","spectral entropy","k nearest neighbor","KNN","probabilistic neural network","maximum mean classification accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electroencephalogram (EEG)","Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)","K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)","Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530058/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 March 2013","displayDocTitle":"Human emotion recognition through short time Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6530058/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13580397","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","conferenceDate":"8-10 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human emotion recognition through short time Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0056ID115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083372S","chronDate":"8-10 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523355","isNumber":"6529997","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523355","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6529997","articleId":"6530058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6530061,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The signals were initially pre-processed for noise removal and baseline correction. 24 morphological descriptors from the bipolar limb leads were used as input to the neural network. 400 beat samples were obtained for each condition. Results show that the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm attains the fastest convergence. Varying the number of hidden nodes however, has no significant effect on the classification accuracy. Performance comparison shows that the HMLP network is more robust and gives better classification accuracy over the multilayered perceptron (MLP) network.

They can be found in autos, washing machines, electrical appliances and even in toys. FPGAs are the most recent computing technology that is used in embedded systems. There is an increasing demand on FPGA based embedded systems, in particular, for applications that require rapid time responses. Engineering education curricula needs to respond to the increasing industrial demand of using FPGAs by introducing new syllabus for teaching and learning this subject. This paper describes the development of new course material for teaching FPGA-based embedded systems design by using `G' Programming Language of LabVIEW. A general overview of FPGA role in engineering education is provided. A survey of available Hardware Programming Languages for FPGAs is presented. A survey about LabVIEW utilization in engineering education is investigated; this is followed by a motivation section of why to use LabVIEW graphical programming in teaching and its capabilities. Then, a section of choosing a suitable kit for the course is laid down. Later, constructivist dynamical model of learning has been developed in accordance with [2-4]. The models are analyzed and their implications are highlighted. This followed by an overview of the designed educational examples of FPGA programming with LabVIEW for the selected kit, in accordance with the developed learning model. To expand the kit educational capacity, new external modules and peripherals have been designed. These extras are explained in details. The teaching and learning manuals of the experiments were developed in a manner that allows student-centred learning approach. Furthermore, additional video tutorials were developed to foster a self-regulated learning and lower dependence on teacher. The final section explains how LabVIEW can be used for developing a hybrid access mode Lab for the experiments (Virtual, Hands-on and Remote), in accordance with [5, 6]. The model will be applied next semester, and the paper is proposing a pedagogical framework for FPGA teaching; pedagogical evaluation will be conducted in future studies. The complete study has been done at the Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Aleppo.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13579638","htmlLink":"/document/6530082/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","conferenceDate":"13-15 March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel FPGA educational paradigm using the next generation programming languages case of an embedded FPGA system course","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel FPGA educational paradigm using the next generation programming languages case of an embedded FPGA system course","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"Contribution1111bpage23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.142994S","chronDate":"13-15 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6522574","isNumber":"6530074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6522574","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6530074","articleId":"6530082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6530116,"authors":[{"name":"P.

They have been submitted at the fifth grade classroom level in elementary schools (as a case study with or without associated teacher's voice). Furthermore, after the application of the suggested CAL packages, practical findings have been compared with classical learning obtained results. Interestingly, all findings are shown to be in agreement with simulation results after running the introduced realistic ANN model. Finally, this work investigated well how measured mathematical teaching quality could be fairly improved via assessment of two learning parameters' performance (achievement level & response time).","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Engineering education","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","educational institutions","mathematics computing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interdisciplinary approach","educational issue","artificial neural network modeling","ANN modeling","computer assisted learning","CAL modules","mathematical topic","teaching","division problem","elementary schools","CAL packages","learning parameter performance","achievement level","response time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computer Assisted Learning","Associative memory","Multimedia Learning Theory","Neural Networks Modeling","Long Division Process"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6530074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EduCon.2013.6530140","startPage":"422","endPage":"430","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6522574/6530074/06530140.pdf","doi":"10.1109/EduCon.2013.6530140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On optimality of teaching quality for a mathematical topic using Neural Networks (with a case study)","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On optimality of teaching quality for a mathematical topic using Neural Networks (with a case study)","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13579690","publicationDate":"March 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6530140/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On optimality of teaching quality for a mathematical topic using Neural Networks (with a case study)","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"Contribution1206bpage422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06108S","chronDate":"13-15 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6522574","isNumber":"6530074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6522574","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6530074","articleId":"6530140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6530169,"authors":[{"name":"Pornpimon Chayratsami","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Education, Faculty of Industrial Education, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology, Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Pornpimon","lastName":"Chayratsami","id":"37870102900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6110-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6111-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6109-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-9567"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2165-9559"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2165-9559"}],"articleNumber":"6530169","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6530169","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engineering education","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","digital circuits","digital simulation","educational courses","electronic engineering computing","electronic engineering education","laboratories","logic design","portable instruments","programmable logic devices","teacher training","teaching","vocational training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supplementary laboratory","digital circuit-and-logic design course","preservice vocational teacher","Thailand","teaching method evaluation","programmable logic device","PLD","student feedbacks","student backgrounds","student opinions","student scores","Digital Works computer simulation program","portable equipment box","student grades"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital circuit and logic design","Laboratory","Teaching methodology","Pre-service vocational teacher"]}],"abstract":"This paper provides an evaluation of a teaching method using a supplementary laboratory, that utilizes 3 types of laboratory setups to increase the understanding and hands-on skill in a digital circuit and logic design class for pre-service vocational teacher in Thailand.

The study explores whether and how the benefits offered by the RAL system can be extended to students in other disciplines and faculties, with a view to creating more equitable opportunities for student learning across the university. Investigating four learning activities in three different disciplines, evaluation questions in the areas of appropriateness, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability are addressed. The study concludes that the RAL approach is sufficiently open and flexible to suite a variety of learning objectives and pedagogies in a number of contexts. Some wider issues are significant to the uptake of RAL and this evaluation highlights main considerations to be addressed if RAL implementations are to occur more broadly across universities as learning systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6530074","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EduCon.2013.6530254","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6522574/6530074/06530254.pdf","startPage":"1157","endPage":"1163","doi":"10.1109/EduCon.2013.6530254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From individual Remote Access Laboratory implementations to institutional learning tools","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 March 2013","displayDocTitle":"From individual Remote Access Laboratory implementations to institutional learning tools","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6530254/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13579796","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530254/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From individual Remote Access Laboratory implementations to institutional learning tools","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"Contribution1401bpage1157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071432S","chronDate":"13-15 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6522574","isNumber":"6530074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6522574","xplore-issue":"6530074","articleId":"6530254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6530326,"authors":[{"name":"Toshihiko Yamakami","affiliation":["Software Solution Access, Chiba, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiko","lastName":"Yamakami","id":"37284430700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-94364-22-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0894-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-94364-26-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6530326","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","mobile commerce","mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital business","multiple negative aspects","Japanese mobile social game business"]}],"abstract":"Mobile social game business has rapidly grown in these years in Japan.

Gaze-steering procedures are usually based on estimated parameters such as image positions, image velocities, depths, camera calibration parameters or etc. However there might be uncertainties in these estimated parameters because of measurement noises, estimation errors or etc. In this case, robust gaze-steering cannot be guaranteed. To compensate for such problem, this paper proposes a gaze-steering method based on LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality). In this proposed method, we first propose a PD (Proportional Derivative) control scheme on the unit sphere that does not use depth parameters. This proposed PD control scheme can avoid uncertainties in the estimated depths and camera calibration parameters, and inconveniences in their estimation process such as use of auxiliary feature points and high computational cost in their nonlinear estimation process. And then the control gain of the proposed PD control scheme on the unit sphere is designed using LMI such that the designed control is robust against uncertainties in the other estimated parameters such as image position, image velocities or etc. Simulation results show the proposed method compensates for uncertainties in the estimated parameters better than a contemporary linear method, and more steadily with time than a contemporary nonlinear method. The proposed method takes less computational cost than the contemporary nonlinear method. Though the proposed method takes more computational cost than the linear method, it is fast enough for real-time processing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust gaze-steering of an active vision system under uncertainties in estimated parameters","publicationTitle":"2012 7th International Conference on Computing and Convergence Technology (ICCCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Conference on Computing and Convergence Technology (ICCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6495744/6530282/06530333.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6530282","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6530333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2012","displayDocTitle":"Robust gaze-steering of an active vision system under uncertainties in estimated parameters","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6530333/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13579938","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust gaze-steering of an active vision system under uncertainties in estimated parameters","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"006046ICCCT2012origresearch.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086024S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6495744","isNumber":"6530282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6495744","xplore-issue":"6530282","articleId":"6530333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AICIT","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6530379,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Bin","affiliation":["Computer & Information Engineering, ZTE Global Cloud Computing Center, College of HoHai University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Chen Bin","id":"37062073400"},{"name":"Wang Zhijian","affiliation":["Computer & Information Engineering, ZTE Global Cloud Computing Center, College of HoHai University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Wang Zhijian","id":"37395639700"},{"name":"Wang Yu","affiliation":["Computer & Information Engineering, ZTE Global Cloud Computing Center, College of HoHai University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Wang Yu","id":"37405653100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-94364-22-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0894-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-94364-26-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6530379","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":137},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","cloud computing","contracts","quality of service","queueing theory","software agents","software performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance collection model","cloud computing","quality of cloud client","quality of service","QoS","service level agreement","SLA","cloud center system performance","cloud component usability","cloud component stability","comprehensive performance evaluation","performance agent and server interface method","PASI method","PMC","PMA","PMS","CAS","mathematical model","queuing theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","queuing","performance analysis","collection model"]}],"abstract":"Quality of cloud client include such as Quality of Service (QoS) and Service Level Agreement (SLA), etc. If the users of the cloud client satisfy with the service quality mainly depends on the wholly performance of the cloud center system, which ultimately decided by the usability and stability of the cloud components belong to the cloud.

By comparing the relationship between transition times and final finished services, defined as the transition rate, we finally reach the conclusion that our new spectrum access mechanism is much better than the random access mechanism.

Therefore, discrete version PSO and conventional PSO were used for solving these two sub-problems respectively. In discrete version PSO, the velocity update rule based on constriction PSO is applied. Meanwhile, an inverse S curve based inertia weight adjustment mechanism was proposed to enhance both the global search and local search to improve search efficiency. Moreover, a grouped communication topology was designed to avoid premature convergence and slow convergence problems, i.e., to balance convergence rate. Instances of MRCPSP in PSPLIB were tested to verify the performance of the proposed scheme.

In case of multi-operand additions the Carry Save Addition compressor trees have outperformed other techniques by 7.89% increase in clock speed at the expense of 28.17% increase in hardware resources.","publicationTitle":"2012 7th International Conference on Computing and Convergence Technology (ICCCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 7th International Conference on Computing and Convergence Technology (ICCCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6495744/6530282/06530545.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6530282","startPage":"1324","endPage":"1327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of fast adder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6530545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of fast adder","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530545/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13580150","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6530545/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of fast adder","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"006258ICCCT2012origresearch.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05583S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6495744","isNumber":"6530282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6495744","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6530282","articleId":"6530545","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AICIT","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6530588,"authors":[{"name":"Manish Parashar","affiliation":["Rutgers University"],"bio":{"p":["Manish Parashar is a professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Rutgers University, where he is director of both the Rutgers Discovery Informatics Institute (RDI2) and the US National Science Foundation (NSF) Cloud and Autonomic Computing Center.

The proposed model considers the package and PCB parasitic inductances, the nonlinearity of the junction capacitors, and the transconductance of the cascode GaN transistor. The switching process is illustrated in detail, including the interaction of the low voltage Si MOSFET and the high voltage GaN HEMT in cascode configuration. The switching loss is obtained by solving the equivalent circuits during the switching transition. The analytical results show that the turn-on loss dominates in hard-switching conditions while the turn-off loss is negligible, due to the intrinsic current source driving mechanism. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by numerous experimental results. The results of both the analytical model and experiments suggest that soft-switching is critical for high voltage GaN in high-frequency high-efficiency applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6709815/06530613.pdf","startPage":"2208","endPage":"2219","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2267804","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2267804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6709815","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6530613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Loss Model of High Voltage GaN HEMT in Cascode Configuration","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical conductivity transitions","elemental semiconductors","equivalent circuits","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","MOSFET","power HEMT","semiconductor device models","silicon","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytical loss model","high voltage HEMT","cascode configuration","high electron mobility transistor","PCB parasitic inductances","junction capacitors","low voltage MOSFET","switching loss","equivalent circuits","switching transition","intrinsic current source driving mechanism","GaN","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analytical model","cascode configuration","gallium nitride high electron mobility transistor (GaN HEMT)","hard-switching","soft-switching"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Loss Model of High Voltage GaN HEMT in Cascode Configuration","volume":"29","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6530613/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14030381","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytical Loss Model of High Voltage GaN HEMT in Cascode Configuration","sourcePdf":"tpel-huang-2267804-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086184S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6709815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"6709815","articleId":"6530613","onlineDate":"12 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6530615,"authors":[{"name":"Simone Balatti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Simone","lastName":"Balatti","id":"38539389200"},{"name":"Stefano Ambrogio","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Ambrogio","id":"38246430500"},{"name":"David C.

In a sensor network, there are a large number of inexpensive sensors which are densely deployed in a region of interest. This dense deployment enables accurate intensity (energy)-based target localization. The maximum likelihood is the predominant objective which leads to a variety of source localization approaches. However, the investigation on the energy-based localization for multiple sources has been very rare. The corresponding robust and efficient algorithms are still being pursued by researchers nowadays. In this paper, we would like to combat the energy-based multiple-source localization problem. We propose two new algorithms, namely, alternating projection algorithm and expectation-maximization algorithm, which can combat the energy-based localization problem for multiple sources. Furthermore, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound for these two new methods.

One possible approach for molecular communication is through the use of virus particles that act as carriers for nucleic acid-based information. This paper analyzes multihop molecular nanonetworks that utilize virus particles as information carrier. The analysis examines the physiochemical and biological characteristics of virus particles such as diffusion, absorption, and decay, and how they affect the reliability of multihop communication in molecular nanonetworks. The paper also analyzes the use of a simple implicit acknowledgement protocol for a single-path topology, and compare its performance to defined and random multipath topologies that do not use acknowledgments. Numerical results show that commensurate reliability is achievable for single-path with implicit acknowledgement and multipath topologies. However, the single-path topology exhibits increased communication delay and more uncertain end-to-end communication time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability and Delay Analysis of Multihop Virus-Based Nanonetworks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2013.2268389","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/6588913/06530638.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2013.2268389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6588913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6530638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530638/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Reliability and Delay Analysis of Multihop Virus-Based Nanonetworks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6530638/","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13748112","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability and Delay Analysis of Multihop Virus-Based Nanonetworks","sourcePdf":"tnano-walsh-2268389-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09224S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6588913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6588913","articleId":"6530638","onlineDate":"12 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6530639,"authors":[{"name":"Fang-Lue Zhang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6630084/6530639/6530639-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fang-Lue Zhang received the B.S. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2009.

The final output is produced by moving foreground objects, together with their dependent regions, to optimal positions.

We challenge a few design aspects of the widely used IEEE 802.11 MAC in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), such as the use of RTS, CTS, and ACK handshaking and the binary exponential backoff mechanisms, and argue that these key mechanisms incur high channel overhead and cannot effectively eliminate hidden terminal problems in multi-hop scenarios. Instead, we propose a set of efficient grid-based channel allocation and access scheduling algorithms using Latin squares, called as GAALS, for scalable WSNs with single-radio multi-channel communication capabilities. Using nodal location information and forming grids over the WSN deployment area, GAALS maps Latin squares to the grids, and dynamically assigns multiple channels to the WSN grids for channel access scheduling purposes. The fairness and scalability of GAALS are analyzed and evaluated in multiflow multihop WSNs with multi-channel capabilities. The results show that GAALS achieves much better performance than other multichannel protocols.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530647/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2013","volume":"13","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"13736135","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6530647/","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Channel Allocation and Access Scheduling for Wireless Internet-of-Things","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Channel Allocation and Access Scheduling for Wireless Internet-of-Things","sourcePdf":"jsen-wu-2268159-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060852S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6583958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6583958","articleId":"6530647","onlineDate":"12 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6530667,"authors":[{"name":"Tuvi Etzion","affiliation":["Computer ScienceDepartment, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Tuvi Etzion (M'89\u2013SM'94\u2013F'04) was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, in 1956.

The first one is to discuss two related packing problems in the Lee and Manhattan metrics. One is to find good codes for error-correction (i.e., packings of Lee spheres) and the other is to transform the space in a way that volumes are preserved and each Lee sphere (or scaled cross-polytope) will be transformed into a shape inscribed in a small cube. The second goal is to consider weighing matrices for some of these coding problems. Weighing matrices have been used as building blocks for codes in the Hamming metric in various constructions. In this paper, we will consider mainly two types of weighing matrices, namely conference matrices and Hadamard matrices, to construct codes in the Lee (and Manhattan) metric. We will show that these matrices have some desirable properties when considered as generator matrices for codes in these metrics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530667/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","volume":"59","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13767476","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6530667/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coding for the Lee and Manhattan Metrics With Weighing Matrices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding for the Lee and Manhattan Metrics With Weighing Matrices","sourcePdf":"tit-etzion-2268156-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122087S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6595627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6595627","articleId":"6530667","onlineDate":"12 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6530670,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6583958/6530670/6530670-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Liu is an Associate Professor with the Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunications Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China.

Most of the existing works on sensor coverage mainly concentrate on the full coverage models, which ensure that all points in the deployment region are covered at the expense of high complexity and cost. In contrast, many applications of IoT focus on the exposure-path prevention, which does not require full coverage sensor deployment, and instead it only needs the partial coverage, because the exposure paths are prevented as long as no moving objects or phenomena can go through a deployment region without being detected. Finally, we focus on the partial coverage by applying the percolation theory to solve the exposure path problem for the network of sensors in IoT. Most of the existing percolation-based schemes apply the continuum-percolation theory, which, however, suffers from the loose lower and upper bounds on the critical density. To overcome this problem, we propose a bond-percolation theory based scheme by mapping the exposure path problem into a bond percolation model. Using this model, we derive the critical densities for both omnidirectional sensor networks and directional sensor networks under random sensor deployment where sensors are deployed according to a two-dimensional Poisson process. The rigorous modeling/analyses and extensive simulations show that our proposed scheme can yield much tighter upper and lower bounds on the critical densities as compared with those generated by continuum-percolation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6583958/06530670.pdf","startPage":"3625","endPage":"3636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2267554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2267554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6583958","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6530670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Percolation Theory-Based Exposure-Path Prevention for Wireless Sensor Networks Coverage in Internet of Things","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","percolation","stochastic processes","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exposure-path prevention","wireless sensor networks coverage","critical density","region coverage","random sensor deployment","Internet of Things","IoT","sensor coverage","partial coverage","bond-percolation theory","exposure path problem mapping","bond percolation model","omnidirectional sensor networks","two-dimensional Poisson process","continuum-percolation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","coverage","exposure-path prevention","internet of things","percolation theory","directional sensing model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530670/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Percolation Theory-Based Exposure-Path Prevention for Wireless Sensor Networks Coverage in Internet of Things","volume":"13","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6530670/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13736140","dateOfInsertion":"22 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Percolation Theory-Based Exposure-Path Prevention for Wireless Sensor Networks Coverage in Internet of Things","sourcePdf":"jsen-liu-2267554-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157051S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6583958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6583958","articleId":"6530670","onlineDate":"12 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6530671,"authors":[{"name":"Stefania Matteoli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6695798/6530671/6530671-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefania Matteoli (S'07\u2013M'11) received the B.S. and M.S.

In contrast to previous studies on signal contamination, the focus of this paper is the detection of targets with unknown spectral signatures (i.e., anomalies) and adaptive detection methods based on a local estimation of the background covariance matrix. Contamination due to the target signal is expected to have a more severe impact when the number of secondary data is limited. An analytical model for signal contamination is developed that allows variability in the extent of contamination. Several parameters, such as the contamination fraction of secondary data and the contaminating signal energy, are introduced, and a contaminating signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio is derived as an objective measure of contamination. The proposed model is employed to experimentally evaluate signal contamination effects and the impact of its variability on the performance of adaptive detection of local anomalies. The outcomes of the experimental study are substantiated by validation with real hyperspectral data. The results obtained highlight the relevance that the impact of signal contamination, assessed with respect to different system parameters, may have for practical applications. This paper represents a starting point for the development of detection performance forecasting models that consider signal contamination.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience

This letter proposes a new method to find filter parameters of the Goldestein filter based on noise level derived by the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. The filtering parameter determined by this method has a definite physical meaning. We used bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) to extract features of an interferometric phase image into multiple scales of spatial frequencies, called intrinsic mode functions (IMF). We constructed a pseudo-SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) with the given IMF component, then the new parameter was applied to the Goldstein filtering method in place of the original fixed value ascertained artificially. The results from simulation and real data show that the performance of the new algorithm outperforms the original Goldstein filter, and its enhanced version, the Baran filter. The quantitative evaluation also shows that modification based on the EMD proposed in our paper minimizes the loss of phase while still reducing the level of noise in an interferogram.","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2013.2263554","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/6675034/06530687.pdf","startPage":"399","endPage":"403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2013.2263554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6675034","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Goldstein SAR Interferogram Filter Based on Empirical Mode Decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6530687","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530687/","displayDocTitle":"Improved Goldstein SAR Interferogram Filter Based on Empirical Mode Decomposition","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"13934556","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6530687/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Goldstein SAR Interferogram Filter Based on Empirical Mode Decomposition","sourcePdf":"lgrs-song-2263554-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052565S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6675034","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6675034","articleId":"6530687","onlineDate":"12 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6530691,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Y\u0131lmaz","affiliation":["Informatics and Information Security Research Center (B\u00ddLGEM, Gebze Institute of Technology, Gebze, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Y\u0131lmaz","id":"38105253600"},{"name":"O\u011fuz Kucur","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, Gebze Institute of Technology, Gebze, Turkey"],"firstName":"O\u011fuz","lastName":"Kucur","id":"37304195400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6530691","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1417},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, performances of joint transmit and receive antenna selection (JTRAS), transmit antenna selection/maximal ratio combining (TAS/MRC), and transmit antenna selection/receive antenna selection (TAS/RAS) techniques are examined in a unified manner in the (42) presence of feedback errors.

The proposed circuit does not employ additional inductors as usual in divide-by-three ILFDs, but exploits the combined effect of two independent injection techniques. The resulting locking range for the divide-by-three mode is comparable in size to that for the divide-by-two. Thus, the proposed circuit can be an optimum alternative to existing dividers, due to the flexibility of two division ratios and due to the absence of additional inductors. An intuitive explanation of the locking mechanism underlying this ILFD and a quantitative analysis are provided, allowing one to predict the amplitude and phase of oscillation in the locked mode, as well as the locking range, with approximate closed-form expressions. Measurements on a circuit prototype and results from SPICE simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the circuit and validate the theoretical model and the resulting formulas.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530706/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","volume":"60","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2013","accessionNumber":"13918220","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6530706/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A CMOS Injection-Locked Frequency Divider Optimized for Divide-by-Two and Divide-by-Three Operation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS Injection-Locked Frequency Divider Optimized for Divide-by-Two and Divide-by-Three Operation","sourcePdf":"tcsi-buonomo-2265977-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073506S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6671940","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6671940","articleId":"6530706","onlineDate":"12 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6530709,"authors":[{"name":"Li Liang","affiliation":["Advanced Module Technology Division, Global Foundries Singapore Private Limited, Singapore"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Liang","id":"37072465800"},{"name":"Rao Xue Song","affiliation":["Advanced Module Technology Division, Global Foundries Singapore Private Limited, Singapore"],"firstName":"Rao Xue","lastName":"Song","id":"37072478800"},{"name":"Lu Wei","affiliation":["Advanced Module Technology Division, Global Foundries Singapore Private Limited, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Wei","id":"37072451200"},{"name":"See Alex","affiliation":["Advanced Module Technology Division, Global Foundries Singapore Private Limited, Singapore"],"firstName":"See","lastName":"Alex","id":"37072548900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0894-6507"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6530709","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1539},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Reliability Society","url":"http://rs.ieee.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://sscs.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology Society","url":"http://www.cpmt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit yield","isolation technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shallow trench isolation crater defect reduction","semiconductor device yield","yield killing defect","STI crater","CMOS","thermal treatment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Shallow trench isolation (STI)","STI crater","high aspect ratio process (HARP)","polymer removal","yield enhancement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6530709","abstract":"One type of yield killing defect called STI Crater is found on advanced CMOS devices during shallow trench isolation (STI) formation.

Optimal Iterative Algorithm for Codebook-Based Downlink Beamforming","abstract":"This letter considers joint beamformer assignment and power allocation (BAPA) for codebook-based downlink beamforming. The BAPA problem represents a mixed integer combinatorial program since beamformer assignments involve binary decisions and beamformer assignments of multiple users are coupled in the downlink SINR constraints. We develop a mixed integer linear program formulation of the BAPA problem, which can be solved using, e.g., the branch-and-cut method. To derive low-complexity solutions, we introduce a virtual uplink problem, in which beamformer assignments of different users are decoupled. We establish the uplink-downlink duality of the two problems and develop a customized iterative algorithm to solve the BAPA problem. Analytic studies show that the customized algorithm yields either optimal (within the desired numerical accuracy) solutions of the BAPA problem (when it is feasible), or infeasibility certificates (when infeasible). The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated with numerical examples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530731/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2013","volume":"20","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"13563467","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6530731/","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Optimal Iterative Algorithm for Codebook-Based Downlink Beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimal Iterative Algorithm for Codebook-Based Downlink Beamforming","sourcePdf":"lsp-pesavento-2265698-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059626S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6525734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6525734","articleId":"6530731","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6530734,"authors":[{"name":"R.

At each legitimate receiver, the noise symbols are aligned in such a way that the information symbols can be decoded with high probability. In contrast, the noise symbols completely mask the information symbols at the eavesdroppers. Our proposed scheme does not use the knowledge of the eavesdropper's channel gains at the transmitter for alignment, yet it achieves the best-known lower bound on the secure degrees of freedom. The knowledge of the eavesdropper's channel gains is still necessary when selecting the rate of the wiretap code.

In this paper, we proposed a fast rendezvous channel hopping algorithm (FRCH), which can guarantee rendezvous within 2N\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n + N timeslots under asynchronous environments, where N denotes the number of licensed channels in a CRN.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530821/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2013","volume":"17","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"13655605","publicationDate":"July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6530821/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Rendezvous Channel-Hopping Algorithm for Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Rendezvous Channel-Hopping Algorithm for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"1475-cl1307-chang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063591S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6565576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6565576","articleId":"6530821","onlineDate":"12 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6530822,"authors":[{"name":"Mihai-Alin Badiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Mihai-Alin","lastName":"Badiu","id":"37546451800"},{"name":"Carles Navarro Manchon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Carles Navarro","lastName":"Manchon","id":"37398308300"},{"name":"Bernard Henri Fleury","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Bernard Henri","lastName":"Fleury","id":"37281732800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6530822","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":432},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6530822","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Channel estimation","Complexity theory","Approximation methods","Vectors","Approximation algorithms","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","channel estimation","decoding","Gaussian channels","Markov processes","OFDM modulation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced-complexity channel estimation","message-passing receiver architecture","OFDM systems","channel frequency response estimation","Gaussian channel model","Markov model","state-space dimension","belief propagation","mean field approximation","probabilistic model","receiver algorithm","noise precision estimation","equalization","decoding","low-complexity versions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","iterative algorithms","message passing","receiver design"]}],"abstract":"We propose an iterative receiver architecture which allows for adjusting the complexity of estimating the channel frequency response in OFDM systems.

The conventional DFT-based estimator zeroes out noise-dominant values in the transform domain, which suffers from a poor performance in the presence of channel leakage. Some improved estimators have been proposed, but these estimators all focus on reducing the leaked energy. We propose to estimate the channel leakage by using the partial minimum mean square error (MMSE) filtering. When the channel delay is sufficiently less than the duration of an OFDM symbol, the partial MMSE filtering can be simplified. Simulation results show that the proposed channel estimator achieves much better performance than conventional estimators and well approaches the MMSE estimator.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.060513.130891","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6582621/06530824.pdf","startPage":"1592","endPage":"1595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.060513.130891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6582621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DFT-Based Channel Estimator for OFDM Systems with Leakage Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6530824","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530824/","displayDocTitle":"DFT-Based Channel Estimator for OFDM Systems with Leakage Estimation","volume":"17","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2013","accessionNumber":"13705837","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6530824/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DFT-Based Channel Estimator for OFDM Systems with Leakage Estimation","sourcePdf":"1592-cl1308-xin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11002S","chronDate":"August  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6582621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6582621","articleId":"6530824","onlineDate":"12 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6530825,"authors":[{"name":"Henning Thomsen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"Thomsen","id":"38575183000"},{"name":"Nuno K.

The asynchronous M2M user access in LTE is obtained through a two-phase access reservation protocol (contention and data phase). Existing analysis related to these protocols is based on the following assumptions: (1) there are sufficient resources in the data phase for all detected contention tokens, and (2) the base station is able to detect collisions, i.e., tokens activated by multiple users. These assumptions are not always applicable to LTE - specifically, (1) due to the variable amount of available data resources caused by variable load, and (2) detection of collisions in contention phase may not be possible. All of this affects transmission of real-time M2M traffic, where data packets have to be sent within a deadline and may have only one contention opportunity.

We proceed to further adjust the transmit-receive filters based on the minimum weighted-mean-square-error (WMSE) principle using the weights obtained from the initial generalized ZF-IA design, in an effort to to enhance the sum-rate performance. In contrast to the existing weighted-sum-rate-maximizing scheme, our method does not require an iterative calculation of the weights. Because of this, the proposed scheme, while not designed specifically to maximize the sum-rate, is computationally efficient and delivers favorable tradeoffs between performance and information exchange overhead.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.060513.122713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6565576/06530828.pdf","startPage":"1336","endPage":"1339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.060513.122713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6565576","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regularized Zero-Forcing Interference Alignment for the Two-Cell MIMO Interfering Broadcast Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6530828","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530828/","displayDocTitle":"Regularized Zero-Forcing Interference Alignment for the Two-Cell MIMO Interfering Broadcast Channel","volume":"17","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"13655609","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6530828/","dateOfInsertion":"23 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularized Zero-Forcing Interference Alignment for the Two-Cell MIMO Interfering Broadcast Channel","sourcePdf":"1336-cl1307-shin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049947S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6565576","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6565576","articleId":"6530828","onlineDate":"12 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6530829,"authors":[{"name":"Ala Abu Alkheir","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept., Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Ala Abu","lastName":"Alkheir","id":"38246674600"},{"name":"Mohamed Ibnkahla","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Dept., Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Ibnkahla","id":"37265105800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6530829","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1753},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chebyshev approximation","Accuracy","Error probability","Diversity reception","Interference","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","automatic repeat request","cochannel interference","error statistics","integral equations","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exponential integral function","sum of exponentials","error probability","communication techniques","cochannel interference","hybrid automatic repeat request","soft combining","selection relaying","opportunistic incremental relaying","Chase combining HARQ system","moment generating function","signal to interference plus noise ratio","computer simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Exponential integral function","co-channel interference","incremental relaying","HARQ"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel approximation for the exponential integral function, E\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n[x], using a sum of exponential functions.

However, synchronization sequences with good correlation properties have a wide frequency spectrum and their separation from the useful signal poses a serious problem, especially if the communication channel is time dispersive. This paper describes a novel method that allows to remove a super-imposed synchronization sequence of unknown magnitude from an equalized OFDM signal by means of frequency-domain matched filter.

The complexity of the proposed technique is half of that of a conventional FBMC implementation.

The polynomial model and its extension to the memory-polynomial are commonly used to model power amplifier nonlinearities. Determination of the appropriate order of the nonlinearity model is an actual issue to achieve effective methods for subsequent linearization techniques. Having in mind these facts, we compare two adaptive methods employing the determination of the appropriate order of the nonlinearity model. The first algorithm is the adaptive order recursive (ORLS) method, while the proposed solution is based on the recursive least squares method with the sequential updates. In the first stage the models were simulated in MATLAB. Depending on the mean square error estimate we decide on the appropriateness of the nonlinearity order increase. The parameters of the power amplifier models are based on the data experimentally obtained using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) device with WBX front-end driven with an OFDM signal. After further performance evaluation, the order adaptation method will be used for efficient digital adaptive predistorter design.","doi":"10.1109/RadioElek.2013.6530949","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RadioElek.2013.6530949","startPage":"389","endPage":"392","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 23rd International Conference Radioelektronika (RADIOELEKTRONIKA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6524966/6530881/06530949.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 23rd International Conference Radioelektronika (RADIOELEKTRONIKA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6530881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive-order polynomial methods for power amplifier model estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive-order polynomial methods for power amplifier model estimation","conferenceDate":"16-17 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6530949/","accessionNumber":"13580711","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6530949/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive-order polynomial methods for power amplifier model estimation","confLoc":"Pardubice, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"77.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037578S","chronDate":"16-17 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6524966","isNumber":"6530881","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6524966","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6530881","articleId":"6530949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6531016,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The results showed a significant channel imbalance. After applying a time-reversal filter, the channel imbalance was remedied and both phase and amplitude were realigned among the channels. In the present study, the RF response of a complete multichannel receiver with antenna was characterized. A 1-8 GHz phased array antenna was mounted in an anechoic chamber and a chirp signal was used to measure the frequency response of each channel as a function of azimuth angle. Each channel's response was equalized using a time-reversal filter derived from the measured data and a combined beam pattern was formed. Time-reversal filters that steer the beam were also generated and it was found that sidelobe level worsened with larger steer angles. A simple mutual coupling model was proposed to explain the beam pattern feature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531016/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13580294","publicationDate":"July 2012","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531016/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wideband phased array calibration method for digital beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband phased array calibration method for digital beamforming","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"12413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081495S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6523353","isNumber":"6531004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523353","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6531004","articleId":"6531016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6531041,"authors":[{"name":"Danielle Scarpone","affiliation":["Air Force Institute of Technology, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Danielle","lastName":"Scarpone","id":"37061627200"},{"name":"Jeremy Stringer","affiliation":["Air Force Institute of Technology, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Stringer","id":"38246152900"},{"name":"Geoffrey Akers","affiliation":["Air Force Institute of Technology, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Akers","id":"37706481200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2792-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2791-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2790-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0547-3578"},{"format":"CD","value":"0547-3578"}],"articleNumber":"6531041","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phased array receiver filtering","measured wideband data","MCWESS array","256-element 16-channel phased array receiver","Air Force Research Laboratory","AFRL Sensors Directorate","AFIT","signal processing technique","adaptive wideband digital beamforming","spatially-separated bandlimited thermal noise sources","wideband digital beamforming technique","wideband DBF","direction-of-arrival estimation","DOA estimation","partial signal spectrum","time reversal beamforming algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Phased Array","Wideband Beamforming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531041","doi":"10.1109/NAECON.2012.6531041","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON)","abstract":"The MCWESS array is a 256-element, 16-channel phased array receiver which was recently built for research purposes in the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Sensors Directorate. Current research at AFIT includes signal processing techniques for adaptive wideband digital beamforming. To support the research, with the help of engineers at AFRL, wideband data was collected using the MCWESS array. The signals collected were received from three different, spatially separated, bandlimited, thermal noise sources. The noise sources have the wide bandwidth desired to support wideband digital beamforming (DBF) research. When the resulting data from the receiver did not correlate with the transmitted noise signal as expected, a closer examination of the set hardware processing done on the signal revealed the signal's true nature. This paper outlines the systematic process followed to determine the actual content of the data, shows that direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is possible when using wideband beamforming techniques even on only a partial signal spectrum, and demonstrates wideband beamforming on measured data using a time reversal beamforming algorithm developed by AFRL.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAECON.2012.6531041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531004","startPage":"121","endPage":"125","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523353/6531004/06531041.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phased array receiver filtering and demonstration of digital beamforming on measured wideband data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6531041/","displayDocTitle":"Phased array receiver filtering and demonstration of digital beamforming on measured wideband data","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"13580318","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phased array receiver filtering and demonstration of digital beamforming on measured wideband data","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"37340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057338S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6523353","isNumber":"6531004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523353","xplore-issue":"6531004","articleId":"6531041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6531050,"authors":[{"name":"Belal H.

Compared to traditional hardware and software redundancy, it is a promising technique that may achieve dependability with a significant reduction in cost, size, weight, and power requirements. Checkpointing protocols, which are necessary components of degrading systems, support task migration through state preservation. They allow real-time embedded systems to recover from any failure by restarting from the last well-defined and consistent state, thus preserving the progress of computations that have been achieved. This paper demonstrates and applies the graceful degradation concept to achieve fault tolerance in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) real-time embedded system. A checkpointing protocol is used to reserve the state of the avionics of the UAV system. Faults were injected during run-time causing one of the system's stability critical control tasks to fail. The system was able successfully to recover by restarting the affected critical task(s) on a different processor with last valid consistent state(s). This paper presents the architecture, fault injection scheme, and the results of the tests performed, which demonstrate the viability of graceful degradation in our tested UAV.","doi":"10.1109/NAECON.2012.6531050","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523353/6531004/06531050.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"177","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON)","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE National Aerospace and Electronics Conference (NAECON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAECON.2012.6531050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time gracefully degrading avionics system for unmanned aerial vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 July 2012","displayDocTitle":"A real-time gracefully degrading avionics system for unmanned aerial vehicles","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13580327","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6531050/","conferenceDate":"25-27 July 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time gracefully degrading avionics system for unmanned aerial vehicles","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"46300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048005S","chronDate":"25-27 July 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6523353","isNumber":"6531004","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523353","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6531004","articleId":"6531050","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6531053,"authors":[{"name":"Sunny Raj Dommaraju","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, USA"],"firstName":"Sunny Raj","lastName":"Dommaraju","id":"37062105500"},{"name":"Saiyu Ren","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, USA"],"firstName":"Saiyu","lastName":"Ren","id":"37283718900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2792-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2791-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2790-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0547-3578"},{"format":"CD","value":"0547-3578"}],"articleNumber":"6531053","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":720},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531053","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","Global Positioning System","low noise amplifiers","UHF amplifiers","UHF integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS low noise amplifier","single ended input","differential output","high gain low noise amplifier","high gain LNA","global navigation systems","GPS","inductor-degeneration topology","amplified differential output","size 180 nm","frequency 1.4 GHz","current 3.5 mA","voltage 1.8 V","gain 43 dB","noise figure 4.02 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","Current Reuse","Differential Output","High Gain","Process Variation"]}],"abstract":"A 1.4 GHz high gain Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) with single ended input and differential output for global navigation systems like GPS operating in L3 and L4 bands is proposed in this paper.

Real-time research offers many solutions with strong timeliness guarantees, but they often require a periodic task model and ask the developer for information that is hard to obtain like execution times or reservation budgets. Within this design space of easy programming, but weak guarantees on one hand and strong guarantees, but harder development on the other, we propose Atlas, the Auto-Training Look-Ahead Scheduler. With a simple yet powerful interface it relies exclusively on data from the application domain: It uses deadlines to express timing requirements and workload metrics to express resource requirements. It replaces implicit knowledge of future job releases as provided by periodic tasks with explicit job submission to enable look-ahead scheduling. Using video playback as a dynamic high-throughput load, we show that the proposed workload metrics are sufficient for Atlas to know an application's execution time behavior ahead of time. Atlas' predictions have a typical relative error below 10%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Atlas: Look-ahead scheduling using workload metrics","doi":"10.1109/RTAS.2013.6531074","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTAS.2013.6531074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531071","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523367/6531071/06531074.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Atlas: Look-ahead scheduling using workload metrics","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13580616","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Atlas: Look-ahead scheduling using workload metrics","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"003122Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049645S","chronDate":"9-11 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523367","isNumber":"6531071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523367","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6531071","articleId":"6531074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6531078,"authors":[{"name":"Renato Mancuso","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Mancuso","id":"37085344669"},{"name":"Roman Dudko","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Dudko","id":"37061875700"},{"name":"Emiliano Betti","affiliation":["University of Rome \u201cTor Vergata\u201d, Italy"],"firstName":"Emiliano","lastName":"Betti","id":"37671778100"},{"name":"Marco Cesati","affiliation":["University of Rome \u201cTor Vergata\u201d, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Cesati","id":"37355372200"},{"name":"Marco Caccamo","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Caccamo","id":"37272874700"},{"name":"Rodolfo Pellizzoni","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Pellizzoni","id":"37282693900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0187-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0186-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0185-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1080-1812"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1080-1812"}],"articleNumber":"6531078","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":1111},"abstract":"Multi-core architectures are shaking the fundamental assumption that in real-time systems the WCET, used to analyze the schedulability of the complete system, is calculated on individual tasks. This is not even true in an approximate sense in a modern multi-core chip, due to interference caused by hardware resource sharing. In this work we propose (1) a complete framework to analyze and profile task memory access patterns and (2) a novel kernel-level cache management technique to enforce an efficient and deterministic cache allocation of the most frequently accessed memory areas. In this way, we provide a powerful tool to address one of the main sources of interference in a system where the last level of cache is shared among two or more CPUs. The technique has been implemented on commercial hardware and our evaluations show that it can be used to significantly improve the predictability of a given set of critical tasks.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Real-time systems","Memory management","Hardware","Instruments","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time cache management framework","multicore architectures","WCET","multicore chip","hardware resource sharing","task memory access patterns","kernel-level cache management technique","CPU"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531078","doi":"10.1109/RTAS.2013.6531078","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523367/6531071/06531078.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTAS.2013.6531078","startPage":"45","endPage":"54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531071","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time cache management framework for multi-core architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time cache management framework for multi-core architectures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531078/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 2013","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13580620","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time cache management framework for multi-core architectures","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"008126Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074938S","chronDate":"9-11 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523367","isNumber":"6531071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523367","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"6531071","articleId":"6531078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6531079,"authors":[{"name":"Heechul Yun","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Heechul","lastName":"Yun","id":"37531828300"},{"name":"Gang Yao","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Yao","id":"37533552700"},{"name":"Rodolfo Pellizzoni","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Pellizzoni","id":"37282693900"},{"name":"Marco Caccamo","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Caccamo","id":"37272874700"},{"name":"Lui Sha","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Lui","lastName":"Sha","id":"37279656500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0187-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0186-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0185-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1080-1812"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1080-1812"}],"articleNumber":"6531079","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1288},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Random access memory","Multicore processing","Real-time systems","Regulators","Benchmark testing","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MemGuard","memory bandwidth reservation system","multicore platform","guaranteed memory bandwidth","best effort memory bandwidth","temporal isolation","SPEC2006 benchmark","memory performance isolation"]}],"abstract":"Memory bandwidth in modern multi-core platforms is highly variable for many reasons and is a big challenge in designing real-time systems as applications are increasingly becoming more memory intensive.

While reducing sampling and communication saves energy, this energy savings usually comes at the cost of reduced recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSense, a framework that reduces the BSN sensors sampling rate while meeting a user-specified accuracy requirement. AdaSense utilizes a classifier set to do either multi-activity classification that requires a high sampling rate or single activity event detection that demands a very low sampling rate. AdaSense aims to utilize lower power single activity event detection most of the time. It only resorts to higher power multi-activity classification to find out the new activity when it is confident that the activity changes. Furthermore, AdaSense is able to determine the optimal sampling rates using a novel Genetic Programming algorithm. Through this Genetic Programming approach, AdaSense reduces sampling rates for both lower power single activity event detection and higher power multi-activity classification. With an existing BSN dataset and a smartphone dataset we collect from eight subjects, we demonstrate that AdaSense effectively reduces BSN sensors sampling rate and outperforms a state-of-the-art solution in terms of energy savings.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Feature extraction","Event detection","Ear","Sensor systems","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body sensor networks","genetic algorithms","mobile computing","user interfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AdaSense","activity recognition","body sensor networks","BSN","sensor sampling","user-specified accuracy requirement","multi-activity classification","genetic programming"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Activity Recognition","Sampling Rate Reduction","Body Sensor Network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RTAS.2013.6531089","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 19th Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523367/6531071/06531089.pdf","startPage":"163","endPage":"172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTAS.2013.6531089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AdaSense: Adapting sampling rates for activity recognition in Body Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531089","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"AdaSense: Adapting sampling rates for activity recognition in Body Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531089/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13580631","conferenceDate":"9-11 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 April 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AdaSense: Adapting sampling rates for activity recognition in Body Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"021105Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067535S","chronDate":"9-11 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523367","isNumber":"6531071","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523367","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6531071","articleId":"6531089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6531113,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Min Wi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"p":["Young-Min Wi received his M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2009.

This is a particularly important consideration for small consumer devices such as smartphones. In many practical situations, however, performance of ASR can be significantly compromised due to ambient noise and variable lighting conditions. Previous research has shown that adding visual cues to standard ASR can mitigate the effects of ambient noise. However, audiovisual (AV) ASR is not robust against variable lighting conditions, which are often encountered by users of consumer devices. Since thermal imaging is invariant to changing lighting conditions, the authors propose a trimodal thermal-audiovisual (TAV) ASR using adaptations of established techniques such as MT, DCT and MFCC. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of this approach over a range of signal-to-noise ratios: tri-modal TAV recognition rates were +39.2% over audio-only ASR and +11.8% over AVASR recognition rates The authors believe that robust ASR will lead to improved user experiences.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/30/6531103/06531117.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust tri-modal automatic speech recognition for consumer applications","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2013.6531117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2013.6531117","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Robust tri-modal automatic speech recognition for consumer applications","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13566110","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6531117/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust tri-modal automatic speech recognition for consumer applications","sourcePdf":"p0352-anderson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055333S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6531103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6531103","articleId":"6531117","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6531122,"authors":[{"name":"F.

HEVC is targeted to provide the same quality as H.264 at about half of the bit-rate and will replace soon to its predecessor in multimedia consumer applications. Up to now, only a few decoder implementations have been reported, most of them oriented to carry out a complexity analysis. In this paper, a DSP-based implementation of the HEVC HM9.0 decoder is presented. Up to the best of our knowledge, it is the first DSP-based implementation shown in the scientific literature. Several tests have been carried out to measure the decoder performance and the computational load distribution among its functional blocks. These results have been compared with the ones obtained with the decoder implementations reported up to date. Finally, based on the results obtained in previous works regarding software optimization of DSP-based decoders, realtime could be achieved for SD formats with a single DSP after optimizing our HEVC decoder. For HD formats, multi-DSP technology will be needed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity analysis of an HEVC decoder based on a digital signal processor","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2013.6531122","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/30/6531103/06531122.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2013.6531122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531103","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531122/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2013","displayDocTitle":"Complexity analysis of an HEVC decoder based on a digital signal processor","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6531122/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"13566115","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity analysis of an HEVC decoder based on a digital signal processor","sourcePdf":"p0391-pescador.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09159S","chronDate":"May  2013","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6531103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6531103","articleId":"6531122","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6531167,"authors":[{"name":"Neslihan K\u0131z\u0131lbey","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik Fak\u00fcltesi, \u0130stanbul Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Neslihan","lastName":"K\u0131z\u0131lbey","id":"37061689400"},{"name":"O\u011fuzhan K\u0131z\u0131lbey","affiliation":["RF Sistemleri, T\u00dcB\u0130TAK B\u0130LGEM, Kocaeli, Turkey"],"firstName":"O\u011fuzhan","lastName":"K\u0131z\u0131lbey","id":"38576916700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5563-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5562-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5561-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6531167","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Gallium nitride","HEMTs","Microwave amplifiers","Wireless communication","Radio frequency","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class E power amplifier topology","power amplifier topology distributed element","lumped elements","AWR microwave office","power added efficiency","frequency band","frequency 2.7 GHz to 2.9 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["inverse class E","power amplifier","GaN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531167","abstract":"In this work, a 10 Watt inverse class-E power amplifier has been proposed, simulated, realized and measured for the 2.7-2.9 GHz wireless applications.

Usually defined on a matrix of size 9 \u00d7 9, the puzzle involves the solver to determine the missing elements of the matrix using certain rules. There is a very strong connection between solving Sudoku puzzles and determining the erased symbols of a codeword that was transmitted over an erasure channel. In this paper, we demonstrate this relationship between Sudoku puzzles and LDPC codes and several solving techniques that can be used to solve one are translated to the other domain. The resulting techniques enable a better understanding of the inner workings of the error control code decoding algorithms as well as efficient solving of Sudoku puzzles using error control coding techniques. The proposed sudoku solving algorithms have been employed to solve puzzles with different difficulty levels and the corresponding performance is calculated.","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2013.6531199","pdfPath":"/iel7/6521474/6531159/06531199.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2013.6531199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sudoku puzzle as an LDPC code","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Sudoku puzzle as an LDPC code","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13578818","publicationDate":"April 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6531199/","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sudoku puzzle as an LDPC code","confLoc":"Haspolat, Turkey","sourcePdf":"143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065048S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6521474","isNumber":"6531159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6521474","xplore-issue":"6531159","articleId":"6531199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6531212,"authors":[{"name":"Ertu\u011frul Ba\u015far","affiliation":["Elektronik ve Haberle\u015fme M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Telsiz Haberle\u015fme Ara\u015ft\u0131rma Laboratuvar\u0131 (THAL) Maslak, \u0130stanbul Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ertu\u011frul","lastName":"Ba\u015far","id":"38666344600"},{"name":"\u00dcmit Ayg\u00f6l\u00fc","affiliation":["Elektronik ve Haberle\u015fme M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Telsiz Haberle\u015fme Ara\u015ft\u0131rma Laboratuvar\u0131 (THAL) Maslak, \u0130stanbul Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u00dcmit","lastName":"Ayg\u00f6l\u00fc","id":"37267743300"},{"name":"Erdal Panay\u0131rc\u0131","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Kadir Has \u00dcniversitesi, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Panay\u0131rc\u0131","id":"37344633800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5563-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5562-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5561-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6531212","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1140},"abstract":"In this study, a novel scheme called orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with index modulation (OFDM-IM) is proposed for frequency selective channels.

The processing load of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) Detector which is the optimum detector for these systems, increases exponentially as a function of system dimension and memory due to testing all possible points. Sphere Decoding (SD) method which tests only the probable points, decreases the processing load dramatically. System memory changes by system dimensions and length of the convolutional encoder. This, in turn, affects the radius of the hyper sphere centered at the observation in the observation space at which SD attains the performance of the ML detector. This effect is investigated via simulation studies. In these simulations, it is observed that the radius of the SD is relatively smaller than the one in ML, and the ratio between the radius values varies from 6,61 in the case of memoryless 2\u00d72 MIMO system to 1,02 in the case of 8x8 MIMO system with memory K=10 according to increased antenna numbers and system memory. In addition to these, it is observed that the radius of the hyper sphere is directly proportional to the memory of the encoder.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6521474/6531159/06531238.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2013.6531238","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2013.6531238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531159","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of convolutional encoder memory on the sphere decoding search radius in MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Maximum likelihood decoding","Maximum likelihood detection","Detectors","Signal processing","Art"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","encoding","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional encoder memory","sphere decoding search radius","MIMO system","new generation communication system","multiple-input-multiple-output system","processing load","maximum likelihood detector","ML detector","optimum detector","system dimension","SD method","system memory","antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output systems","Maximum Likelihood","Sphere Decoding","Convolutional Encoder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"The effect of convolutional encoder memory on the sphere decoding search radius in MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531238/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13578857","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of convolutional encoder memory on the sphere decoding search radius in MIMO systems","confLoc":"Haspolat, Turkey","sourcePdf":"184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039663S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6521474","isNumber":"6531159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6521474","xplore-issue":"6531159","articleId":"6531238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6531260,"authors":[{"name":"Melik Serhat Mercan","affiliation":["Savunma \u00dcr\u00fcn \u00c7\u00f6z\u00fcmleri Departman\u0131, Neta\u015f Telekom\u00fcnikasyon A.\u015e., Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Melik Serhat","lastName":"Mercan","id":"38246883900"},{"name":"Ahmet \u00c7al\u0131\u015fkan","affiliation":["Savunma \u00dcr\u00fcn \u00c7\u00f6z\u00fcmleri Departman\u0131, Neta\u015f Telekom\u00fcnikasyon A.\u015e., Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"\u00c7al\u0131\u015fkan","id":"37061967600"},{"name":"Ersin \u00d6zt\u00fcrk","affiliation":["Savunma \u00dcr\u00fcn \u00c7\u00f6z\u00fcmleri Departman\u0131, Neta\u015f Telekom\u00fcnikasyon A.\u015e., Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ersin","lastName":"\u00d6zt\u00fcrk","id":"38229929900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5563-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5562-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5561-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6531260","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Radar imaging","Ultra wideband radar","Radar antennas","Imaging","Synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition","image reconstruction","MIMO radar","radar imaging","ultra wideband radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["through wall imaging","MIMO UWB radar","ultra wideband multiple-input multiple-output radar","data acquisition","signal processing","image reconstruction","image processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ultra wideband","SAR","MIMO radar","through wall imaging","back projection"]}],"abstract":"A real-time through wall imaging system based on ultra wideband (UWB) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar is presented in this paper.

However, error performance of the sliding window decoding scheme used to decode these codes is considerably degraded over channels with memory, such as the burst erasure channel. Traditionally, communication over channels with memory is achieved through the use of block interleavers but as it introduces a large amount of delay, it is not always a viable option. In this paper, employing a convolutional interleaver which benefits from the inherent convolutional nature of the spatially-coupled codes with very low overall delay is considered. The performance of the proposed combination is analyzed using the density evolution technique. The performance improvement of using a convolutional inter-leaver is demonstrated as a function of the added interleaving delay in terms of iterative decoding thresholds.","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2013.6531268","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6521474/6531159/06531268.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2013.6531268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531159","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of spatially coupled codes over the correlated erasure channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of spatially coupled codes over the correlated erasure channel","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13578887","publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531268/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531268/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2013","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of spatially coupled codes over the correlated erasure channel","confLoc":"Haspolat, Turkey","sourcePdf":"216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046877S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6521474","isNumber":"6531159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6521474","xplore-issue":"6531159","articleId":"6531268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6531271,"authors":[{"name":"Mustafa Erdo\u011fan","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fch.

Optimization methods, EM based methods or Variational Bayesian methods are proposed to solve this problem. However, the computational cost of these methods can be prohibitively large in case of a massive data matrix, when the known entries do not even fit into the fast random access memory (RAM). Traditional methods access the data matrix several times during iterations and the data transfer from a secondary storage becomes the key bottleneck. To alleviate this problem, we devise a randomized scheme by sampling a subset of rows or columns of the original matrix. The resulting algorithm is efficient in terms of the number of required disk accesses, is highly parallelizable and produces factorizations that are competitively accurate.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matrix decomposition","Random access memory","Approximation methods","Approximation algorithms","Jacobian matrices","Bayes methods","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","disc storage","matrix algebra","optimisation","random processes","random-access storage","randomised algorithms","variational techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low rank matrix completion","random sampling","low rank approximation","optimization method","EM based method","variational Bayesian method","massive data matrix","random access memory","RAM","iteration","data transfer","secondary storage","randomized scheme","disk access"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SIU.2013.6531278","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6521474/6531159/06531278.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2013.6531278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low rank matrix completion via random sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531278","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low rank matrix completion via random sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531278/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13578897","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low rank matrix completion via random sampling","confLoc":"Haspolat, Turkey","sourcePdf":"225.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041702S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2013","isNumber":"6531159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6521474","articleId":"6531278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6531279,"authors":[{"name":"G\u00f6khan M.

the performance analysis of energy detector method for the spectrum sensing model in cognitive radio networks over Rayleigh fading channel with selection combining of the receiver diversity technique

Here, energy detector model for non-cooperative spectrum sensing is investigated in which Chirp-z transform is used. The Chirp-z transform is proposed as an efficient algorithm to increase the dispersed frequency spectrum utilization, provides a flexibility to work only on the frequency spectrum of interest. The general closed form mathematical equation of the optimal detection threshold for selection combining receiver diversity technique is derived over Rayleigh fading channel. The performance analysis of the proposed system model is investigated with the optimal detection threshold value and presented through ROC curve for different SNR values. The achieved results validate the spectrum sensing performance increase in selection combining of the receiver antenna diversity technique, compared to the no diversity case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13578908","htmlLink":"/document/6531289/","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sensing for cognitive radio with selection combining receiver antenna diversity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sensing for cognitive radio with selection combining receiver antenna diversity","confLoc":"Haspolat, Turkey","sourcePdf":"235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114835S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6521474","isNumber":"6531159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6521474","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6531159","articleId":"6531289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6531292,"authors":[{"name":"P\u00fcren G\u00fcler","affiliation":["Enformatik Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc, Orta Do\u011fu Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"P\u00fcren","lastName":"G\u00fcler","id":"37061707300"},{"name":"Alptekin Temizel","affiliation":["Enformatik Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc, Orta Do\u011fu Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Alptekin","lastName":"Temizel","id":"37393040900"},{"name":"Tu\u011fba Ta\u015fkaya Temizel","affiliation":["Enformatik Enstit\u00fcs\u00fc, Orta Do\u011fu Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Turkey"],"firstName":"Tu\u011fba Ta\u015fkaya","lastName":"Temizel","id":"37944897200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5563-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5562-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5561-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6531292","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"abstract":"Anomaly detection from crowd videos is an issue that is becoming more important due to the difficulties in maintaining the public security in crowded places. Surveillance videos has a significant role for enabling the real time analysis of the captured events occurring in crowded places. This paper presents a method that detects anomalies in crowd in real-time using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The proposed method consists of extracting the crowd behavior properties (velocity, direction) by tracking scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) feature points and fitting the extracted behavior properties into a Gaussian Model. In this paper, only the global anomalies which occur on the overall video frame are handled. According to the test results, the method gives comparable results with the state-of-art methods and also can run in real-time. In addition, it is less complex than the compared state-of-art methods and works unsupervised.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6521474/6531159/06531292.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2013.6531292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2013.6531292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531159","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An unsupervised method for anomaly detection from crowd videos","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","Conferences","Computer vision","Feature extraction","Pattern recognition","Real-time systems","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognition","computer vision","feature extraction","Gaussian processes","object detection","object tracking","security of data","unsupervised learning","video surveillance","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised method","anomaly detection","crowd video","public security","video surveillance","real time captured event analysis","computer vision","machine learning","crowd behavior property extraction","scale invariant feature transform","SIFT feature point tracking","Gaussian model","video frame","global anomaly handling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["crowd behavior analysis","video surveillance applications","computer vision"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"An unsupervised method for anomaly detection from crowd videos","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13578911","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An unsupervised method for anomaly detection from crowd videos","confLoc":"Haspolat, Turkey","sourcePdf":"24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047493S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2013","isNumber":"6531159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6521474","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6531292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6531313,"authors":[{"name":"Tu\u011fcan Akta\u015f","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l, Orta Do\u011fu Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Tu\u011fcan","lastName":"Akta\u015f","id":"37061576200"},{"name":"Ali \u00d6zg\u00fcr Y\u0131lmaz","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l, Orta Do\u011fu Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ali \u00d6zg\u00fcr","lastName":"Y\u0131lmaz","id":"38199605800"},{"name":"Emre Akta\u015f","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l, Orta Do\u011fu Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Emre","lastName":"Akta\u015f","id":"37275339000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5563-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5562-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5561-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6531313","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Encoding","Network coding","Electronic mail","Binary phase shift keying","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","cooperative communication","error statistics","Monte Carlo methods","network coding","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Q-function sampling","network coded communication","cooperative communication","wireless communication","bit error rate","Monte Carlo simulation","approximation theory","end-to-end BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless network coding","fading channel","Q-function","expectation integral","Dirac delta"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531313","abstract":"In the area of cooperative and network coded communication that naturally arises from cooperation, which become increasingly important in wireless communications, the expected end-to-end bit error rate (BER) values are frequently required to compare the proposed coding, relaying, and decoding techniques.

This generalized prefix provides additional degree of freedom, which can be optimized and provides improved performance for correlated MIMO channels.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","Wireless communication","Tin","Fading","IP networks","Finite impulse response filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance MIMO OFDM wireless systems","generalized cyclic prefix","spectrum efficiency","high data rate wireless systems","spatial streams","CP","degree of freedom","correlated MIMO channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Generalized Prefix","OFDM","MIMO","Fading"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2013.6531319","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6521474/6531159/06531319.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2013.6531319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance MIMO OFDM wireless systems with generalized prefix","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"High-performance MIMO OFDM wireless systems with generalized prefix","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13578938","publicationDate":"April 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6531319/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531319/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance MIMO OFDM wireless systems with generalized prefix","confLoc":"Haspolat, Turkey","sourcePdf":"27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061855S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6521474","isNumber":"6531159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6521474","xplore-issue":"6531159","articleId":"6531319","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6531358,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Oturak","affiliation":["Elektronik ve Otomasyon B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, B\u00fclent Ecevit \u00dcniversitesi, Zonguldak, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ahmet","lastName":"Oturak","id":"38194019600"},{"name":"Ertan \u00d6zt\u00fcrk","affiliation":["Elektrik-Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, B\u00fclent Ecevit \u00dcniversitesi, Zonguldak, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ertan","lastName":"\u00d6zt\u00fcrk","id":"37448403900"},{"name":"Koray Yanik","affiliation":["T.C.D.D, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Koray","lastName":"Yanik","id":"37061461900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5563-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5562-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5561-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6531358","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","OFDM","Frequency division multiplexing","Shift registers","Frequency modulation","Bit error rate","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler effect","error statistics","numerical analysis","OFDM modulation","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels","shift registers","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shift register based frequency hopping OFDM performance","orthogonal frequency multiplexing","Doppler spread flat Rayleigh channel","frequency hopping system","Doppler effect","Jakes channel model","quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","phase shift keying","PSK","BER results","baseband modulation techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Shift Register","Frequency Hopping (FH)","Orthoganal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","Doppler Spread"]}],"abstract":"In this work, the performances of Shift Register based Frequency Hopping Orthogonal Frequency Multiplexing (SR-FH-OFDM) signals over a Doppler spread flat Rayleigh channel is investigated.

of the most important elements of the minimization of the damages. Local meteorological radars works at regional base hence they cannot represent the parameters of precipitation. Because of insufficiency of the radar systems early detection, satellite images can be used to create decision systems. At this point firstly infrared satellite images will be classified and then comparative results will be discussed on experimental stage. In this work, we used Wavelet Transform applied to infrared satellite images to extract approximation coefficients. Size of these coefficients are reduced using Principal Component Analysis and classified through classification algorithms. Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machines are used for classification. As a result of the classification made with Artificial Neural Networks, we accomplished 84% prediction rate. With the classification of Support Vector Machines, we reached 93% prediction rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531492/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13579110","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531492/","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Early detection of hazardous weather conditions in Turkey with satellite images using Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Early detection of hazardous weather conditions in Turkey with satellite images using Support Vector Machines and Artificial Neural Networks","confLoc":"Haspolat, Turkey","sourcePdf":"448.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050322S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6521474","isNumber":"6531159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6521474","xplore-issue":"6531159","articleId":"6531492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6531494,"authors":[{"name":"Apdullah Yay\u0131k","affiliation":["Enformatik Ana Bilim Dal\u0131, Mustafa Kemal \u00dcniversitesi, Hatay, Turkey"],"firstName":"Apdullah","lastName":"Yay\u0131k","id":"38243447900"},{"name":"Yakup Kutlu","affiliation":["Bilgisayar M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Mustafa Kemal \u00dcniversitesi, Hatay, Turkey"],"firstName":"Yakup","lastName":"Kutlu","id":"37670613700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5563-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5562-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5561-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6531494","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531494","abstract":"Pseudo-random number generators generate sequent of digits that cannot be expected before.

Due to its inherent properties, the Fourier domain is widely used in compressive sensing applications. Sparse signal recovery applications making use of a small number of Fourier transform coefficients, have made solutions to large scale data recovery problems, i.e. images, applicable and more practical. The sparse reconstruction of two dimensional images is performed by making use of sampling patterns generated by taking into consideration the general frequency characteristics of any image. In this work, instead of forming a general sampling pattern for infrared images of sea surface platforms, a special sampling pattern has been obtained by making use of a database containing images recorded under similar atmospheric conditions. It has been shown by experimental results that the proposed sampling pattern provides better sparse recovery compared to the widely used pattern proposed in the literature.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Databases","Sea surface","Sensors","Imaging","Electronic mail","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","image reconstruction","image representation","image sampling","infrared imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["database based Fourier coefficient sampling","sparse recovery","infrared sea surface platform image","compressive sensing framework","sparse representation","subNyquist sampling rate","Fourier domain","sparse signal recovery","Fourier transform coefficient","data recovery problem","sparse reconstruction","sampling pattern","infrared image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive Sensing","Fourier Domain Sampling","Sampling Pattern","Infrared Imaging"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SIU.2013.6531518","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6521474/6531159/06531518.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2013.6531518","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Database based fourier coefficient sampling for sparse recovery of infrared sea surface platform images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531518","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Database based fourier coefficient sampling for sparse recovery of infrared sea surface platform images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531518/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531518/","accessionNumber":"13579136","conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Database based fourier coefficient sampling for sparse recovery of infrared sea surface platform images","confLoc":"Haspolat, Turkey","sourcePdf":"476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052802S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6521474","isNumber":"6531159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6521474","xplore-issue":"6531159","articleId":"6531518","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6531525,"authors":[{"name":"Orhan F\u0131rat","affiliation":["Bilgisayar M\u00fchendisli\u011fi B\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fc, Orta Do\u011fu Teknik \u00dcniversitesi, Ankara, T\u00fcrkiye"],"firstName":"Orhan","lastName":"F\u0131rat","id":"37061957300"},{"name":"Fato\u015f T.

In this study, we concentrated on representation learning using unlabeled remote sensing data and using these representations to recognize different objects which vary in complexity, characteristics and ground resolution. In the proposed framework, randomly sampled patches from remote sensing images are first used to train a single layer sparse-auto encoder in order to learn the most efficient representation for the dataset. These representations are appeared to be as gabor filters in various orientations and parameters, color co-occurrence and color filters and edge-detection filters. Subsequently, representations are used to extract features from target object based on convolution and pooling. Finally, extracted features are used to train a machine learning algorithm and classification performances are evaluated. The proposed method is tested on recognition of dispersal areas, taxi-routes, parking areas and airplanes which are all subparts of an airfield. Performance of the proposed method is competitive with currently used rulebased and supervised methods.","doi":"10.1109/SIU.2013.6531525","publicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 21st Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6521474/6531159/06531525.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIU.2013.6531525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531159","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Representation learning with convolutional sparse autoencoders for remote sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Representation learning with convolutional sparse autoencoders for remote sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531525/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 April 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13579143","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6531525/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Representation learning with convolutional sparse autoencoders for remote sensing","confLoc":"Haspolat, Turkey","sourcePdf":"483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0554S","chronDate":"24-26 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6521474","isNumber":"6531159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6521474","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6531159","articleId":"6531525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6531530,"authors":[{"name":"Server Kasap","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi, Lefke Avrupa \u00dcniversitesi, Kibris, Turkey"],"firstName":"Server","lastName":"Kasap","id":"37409088300"},{"name":"Soydan Redif","affiliation":["Elektrik ve Elektronik M\u00fchendisli\u011fi, Lefke Avrupa \u00dcniversitesi, Kibris, Turkey"],"firstName":"Soydan","lastName":"Redif","id":"37298004900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5563-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5562-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5561-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6531530","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Jacobian matrices","Polynomials","Random access memory","Read only memory","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Blind source separation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","field programmable gate arrays","Jacobian matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","field-programmable gate array","second-order convolutive blind signal separation algorithm","parallel Jacobi method","para-Hermitian polynomial matrices","hardware implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Second-Order Sequential Best Rotation algorithm","Parallel Jacobi Method","Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)"]}],"abstract":"The second-order sequential best rotation (SBR2) algorithm may be viewed as a blind signal separation algorithm.

Traditionally, the form of such local descriptors is predefined in a handcrafted way. In this paper, we propose a method to learn a discriminant face descriptor (DFD) in a data-driven way. The idea is to learn the most discriminant local features that minimize the difference of the features between images of the same person and maximize that between images from different people. In particular, we propose to enhance the discriminative ability of face representation in three aspects. First, the discriminant image filters are learned. Second, the optimal neighborhood sampling strategy is soft determined. Third, the dominant patterns are statistically constructed. Discriminative learning is incorporated to extract effective and robust features. We further apply the proposed method to the heterogeneous (cross-modality) face recognition problem and learn DFD in a coupled way (coupled DFD or C-DFD) to reduce the gap between features of heterogeneous face images to improve the performance of this challenging problem. Extensive experiments on FERET, CAS-PEAL-R1, LFW, and HFB face databases validate the effectiveness of the proposed DFD learning on both homogeneous and heterogeneous face recognition problems. The DFD improves POEM and LQP by about 4.5 percent on LFW database and the C-DFD enhances the heterogeneous face recognition performance of LBP by over 25 percent.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Discriminant Face Descriptor","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2013.112","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/6687161/06531609.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2013.112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6687161","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531609/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Learning Discriminant Face Descriptor","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6531609/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2013","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"13973278","pubMedId":"24356350","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Discriminant Face Descriptor","sourcePdf":"ttp2014020289.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141617S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6687161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"215","xplore-issue":"6687161","articleId":"6531609","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6531615,"authors":[{"name":"Weixin Li","affiliation":["lectrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of California, La Jolla, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6674932/6531615/6531615-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weixin Li received the bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2008, the MSc degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, San Diego, in 2011, and is currently working toward the PhD degree.

The proposed detector is based on a video representation that accounts for both appearance and dynamics, using a set of mixture of dynamic textures models. These models are used to implement 1) a center-surround discriminant saliency detector that produces spatial saliency scores, and 2) a model of normal behavior that is learned from training data and produces temporal saliency scores. Spatial and temporal anomaly maps are then defined at multiple spatial scales, by considering the scores of these operators at progressively larger regions of support. The multiscale scores act as potentials of a conditional random field that guarantees global consistency of the anomaly judgments. A data set of densely crowded pedestrian walkways is introduced and used to evaluate the proposed anomaly detector. Experiments on this and other data sets show that the latter achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection results.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2013.111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/6674932/06531615.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2013.111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6674932","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection and Localization in Crowded Scenes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531615/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection and Localization in Crowded Scenes","volume":"36","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"13933867","pubMedId":"24231863","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531615/","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection and Localization in Crowded Scenes","sourcePdf":"ttp2014010018.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088238S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6674932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"356","xplore-issue":"6674932","articleId":"6531615","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6531636,"authors":[{"name":"Jinjian Wu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education of China, School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6630084/6531636/6531636-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinjian Wu received the B.E. degree in electronic engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2008.

The existing pixel-based JND models mainly consider the orderly factors and always underestimate the JND threshold of the disorderly region. Recent research indicates that the human visual system (HVS) actively predicts the orderly information and avoids the residual disorderly uncertainty for image perception and understanding. Thus, we suggest that there exists disorderly concealment effect which results in high JND threshold of the disorderly region. Beginning with the Bayesian inference, we deduce an autoregressive model to imitate the active prediction of the HVS. Then, we estimate the disorderly concealment effect for the novel JND model. Experimental results confirm that the proposed JND model outperforms the relevant existing ones. Furthermore, we apply the proposed JND model in image compression, and around 15% of bit rate can be reduced without jeopardizing the perceptual quality.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2013.2268053","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2013.2268053","startPage":"1705","endPage":"1710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/6630084/06531636.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6630084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Just Noticeable Difference Estimation for Images With Free-Energy Principle","supplementGroup":[{"repository":"code-ocean","type":"algorithm","badge":"Available","badgeMsg":"This document includes code submitted by the author.","supplement":[{"doi":"10.24433/CO.98ce65a7-1a95-4152-83b2-f356e5ccc4cf","uri":"https://codeocean.com/2017/05/22/just-noticeable-difference-estimation-for-images-with-free-energy-principle","name":"Just Noticeable Difference Estimation for Images with Free-Energy Principle","language":"MATLAB","widgetUrl":"https://codeocean.com/widget.js?id=98ce65a7-1a95-4152-83b2-f356e5ccc4cf","badgeType":"Code-Available"}]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Just Noticeable Difference Estimation for Images With Free-Energy Principle","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2013","volume":"15","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531636/","accessionNumber":"13842717","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531636/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Just Noticeable Difference Estimation for Images With Free-Energy Principle","sourcePdf":"tmm-wu-2268053-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104126S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6630084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"6630084","articleId":"6531636","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6531637,"authors":[{"name":"Honggui Han","affiliation":["Beijing University of Technology, College of Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6766657/6531637/6531637-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Honggui Han (M'11) received the B.S. degree in automatic from Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China, in 2005, the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.

This SOFNN-ACA is constructed online via simultaneous structure and parameter learning processes. In structure learning, a set of fuzzy rules can be self-designed using an information-theoretic methodology. The fuzzy rules with high spiking intensities (SI) are divided into new ones. And the fuzzy rules with a small relative mutual information (RMI) value will be pruned in order to simplify the FNN structure. In parameter learning, the consequent part parameters are learned through the use of an ACA that incorporates an adaptive learning rate strategy into the learning process to accelerate the convergence speed. Then, the convergence of SOFNN-ACA is analyzed. Finally, the proposed SOFNN-ACA is used to model nonlinear systems. The modeling results demonstrate that this proposed SOFNN-ACA can model nonlinear systems effectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2013.2260537","startPage":"554","endPage":"564","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2013.2260537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766657","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/6766657/06531637.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Systems Modeling Based on Self-Organizing Fuzzy-Neural-Network With Adaptive Computation Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531637/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Systems Modeling Based on Self-Organizing Fuzzy-Neural-Network With Adaptive Computation Algorithm","volume":"44","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6531637/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14159328","pubMedId":"23782841","publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Systems Modeling Based on Self-Organizing Fuzzy-Neural-Network With Adaptive Computation Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tcyb-han-2260537-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.251546S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"6766657","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6766657","articleId":"6531637","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6531638,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Dong Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6670533/6531638/6531638-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jia-Dong Zhang received the M.Sc. degree in computer science and engineering from Yunnan University, Kunming, China, in 2009.

Estimating traffic states accurately from the obtained GPS data streams has great potential to increase efficiency of the existing traffic systems and to help reduce commuting time and fuel consumption. In this paper, first we propose a novel method to reasonably process GPS data by increasing weights of recent records and high velocity, rather than employing the current two extreme and popular approaches: the naive method aggregating all records with equal weights and the sliding-window (SW) sampling method preserving only the most recent records. Then, in line with the existing works, the proposed weighted approach is explored in two ways: aggregate-based and sampling-based ways. The aggregate-based way is classical but somewhat specific to the particular goal of traffic state estimation, whereas the sampling-based way is somewhat complicated but provides a universal set of samples for performing a variety of analyses. In the sampling-based way, a heuristic method is proposed to accurately estimate traffic states using preserved samples. Both ways are leveraged to evaluate performance of the novel weighed method and the heuristic method for estimating traffic states using samples. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of these methods is experimentally validated using a field-experiment data set (Mobile Century) and three simulated data sets.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Global Positioning System","Mobile communication","Sampling methods","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","Global Positioning System","mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aggregating methods","sampling methods","GPS data streams","traffic state estimation","mobile devices","sliding window sampling method","heuristic method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aggregating","Global Positioning System (GPS) data streams","heuristic","sampling","time decay","traffic state estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TITS.2013.2264753","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/6670533/06531638.pdf","startPage":"1629","endPage":"1641","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2013.2264753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aggregating and Sampling Methods for Processing GPS Data Streams for Traffic State Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531638","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Aggregating and Sampling Methods for Processing GPS Data Streams for Traffic State Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531638/","volume":"14","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531638/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13934294","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aggregating and Sampling Methods for Processing GPS Data Streams for Traffic State Estimation","sourcePdf":"tits-zhang-2264753-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096826S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6670533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6670533","articleId":"6531638","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6531640,"authors":[{"name":"Edoardo Pasolli","affiliation":["NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Computational and Information Sciences and Technology Office, Greenbelt, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6695798/6531640/6531640-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Edoardo Pasolli (S'08\u2013M'13) received the M.Sc. degree in telecommunications engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information and communication technologies from the University of Trento, Trento, Italy, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.","He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Intelligent Information Processing Laboratory, Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, University of Trento, from December 2011 to September 2012.

Current strategies formulate the active learning problem in the spectral domain only. However, remote sensing images are intrinsically defined both in the spectral and spatial domains. In this paper, we explore this fact by proposing a new active learning approach for support vector machine classification. In particular, we suggest combining spectral and spatial information directly in the iterative process of sample selection. For this purpose, three criteria are proposed to favor the selection of samples distant from the samples already composing the current training set. In the first strategy, the Euclidean distances in the spatial domain from the training samples are explicitly computed, whereas the second one is based on the Parzen window method in the spatial domain. Finally, the last criterion involves the concept of spatial entropy. Experiments on two very high resolution images show the effectiveness of regularization in spatial domain for active learning purposes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531640/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"13998055","htmlLink":"/document/6531640/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SVM Active Learning Approach for Image Classification Using Spatial Information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SVM Active Learning Approach for Image Classification Using Spatial Information","sourcePdf":"tgrs-pasolli-2258676-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084948S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6695798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"6695798","articleId":"6531640","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6531643,"authors":[{"name":"Kyoung Kwan Ahn","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6787012/6531643/6531643-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kyoung Kwan Ahn (M\u201902) received the B.S. degree from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 1990, the M.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 1992, and the Ph.D. degree from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 1999.","He is currently a Professor in the School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Korea.

First of all, the mathematical model of the EHA is developed. The position control is then formulated using a modified backstepping technique and the uncertainties in hydraulic system are adapted by employing a special Lyapunov function. The control signal consists of an adaptive control signal to compensate the uncertainties and a simple robust structure to ensure the robustness corresponding to a bounded disturbance.

The Young's modulus in 30-\u03bcm thick Si substrate decreased by 30% compared to the modulus of 50-\u03bcm thickness. In 30-\u03bcm thick Si substrate, the lattice structure of Si atom is highly distorted. Large distortion of the lattice structure induces the Young's modulus reduction, consequently weakens the mechanical strength. A DRAM chip of 200-\u03bcm thickness is bonded to a Si interposer and thinned down to 50/40/30/20-\u03bcm thickness, respectively. The retention characteristics of DRAM cell are degraded depending on the decreasing of the chip thickness, especially dramatically degraded below 50-\u03bcm thickness. The retention time of DRAM cell in the 20- \u03bcm thick chip is shortened by ~ 40% compared to the 50-\u03bcm thick chip, regardless of the well structure (triple-well, twin-well). The distortion of the lattice structure in the thin chip effects carrier recombination rates, consequently a shortening retention time of DRAM cell.","doi":"10.1109/LED.2013.2265336","publicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Electron Device Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/55/6565378/06531648.pdf","startPage":"1038","endPage":"1040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2013.2265336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6565378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degradation of Memory Retention Characteristics in DRAM Chip by Si Thinning for 3-D Integration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531648","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531648/","displayDocTitle":"Degradation of Memory Retention Characteristics in DRAM Chip by Si Thinning for 3-D Integration","volume":"34","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"13686369","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531648/","dateOfInsertion":"22 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degradation of Memory Retention Characteristics in DRAM Chip by Si Thinning for 3-D Integration","sourcePdf":"led-lee-2265336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054315S","chronDate":"Aug.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"6565378","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6565378","articleId":"6531648","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6531650,"authors":[{"name":"Ramji Venkataramanan","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Ramji Venkataramanan (S'06\u2013M'09) received the B.Tech. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in 2002, and the Ph.D degree in Electrical Engineering (Systems) from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2008.

The coding strategy involves block-Markov superposition coding using Marton's coding scheme for the broadcast channel without feedback as the starting point. If the message rates in the Marton scheme are too high to be decoded at the end of a block, each receiver is left with a list of messages compatible with its output. Resolution information is sent in the following block to enable each receiver to resolve its list. The key observation is that the resolution information of the first receiver is correlated with that of the second. This correlated information is efficiently transmitted via joint source-channel coding, using ideas similar to the Han-Costa coding scheme. Using the result, we obtain an achievable rate region for the stochastically degraded additive white Gaussian noise broadcast channel with noisy feedback from only one receiver. It is shown that this region is strictly larger than the no-feedback capacity region.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Achievable Rate Region for the Broadcast Channel With Feedback","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2268532","endPage":"6191","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6595627/06531650.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"6175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2268532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531650","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Encoding","Random variables","Joints","Noise measurement","Transmitters","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","block codes","broadcast channels","combined source-channel coding","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["achievable rate region","two-receiver discrete memoryless broadcast channel","generalized feedback","block-Markov superposition coding","Marton coding scheme","resolution information","joint source-channel coding","Han-Costa coding scheme","stochastically degraded additive white Gaussian noise broadcast channel","noisy feedback","no-feedback capacity region"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Achievable rate region","broadcast channel (BC)","capacity region","feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Achievable Rate Region for the Broadcast Channel With Feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531650/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","volume":"59","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6531650/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2013","accessionNumber":"13767501","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Achievable Rate Region for the Broadcast Channel With Feedback","sourcePdf":"tit-pradhan-2268532-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114767S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6595627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6595627","articleId":"6531650","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":6531655,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Richy","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, CREATIS;

This mode requires a strategy for alternating B-mode and flow emissions. Traditional strategies either halve the maximum measurable velocity or introduce gaps in the flow data. The objective of this article is to propose a completely original method based on compressive sensing for reconstructing the Doppler signal segment by segment. Our approach is based on randomly alternating B-mode and flow emissions. The influence of the different parameters on the reconstruction quality is studied in detail. The technique is evaluated and its feasability is validated in simulation and from experimental in vivo data. It is also compared to the only method from the literature, proposed by Jensen, that reconstructs blood velocity estimates from sparse data sets.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2013.2266871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/6648718/06531655.pdf","startPage":"1979","endPage":"1988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2013.2266871","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6648718","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blood Velocity Estimation Using Compressive Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531655/","displayDocTitle":"Blood Velocity Estimation Using Compressive Sensing","volume":"32","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13865682","pubMedId":"23782797","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531655/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blood Velocity Estimation Using Compressive Sensing","sourcePdf":"tmi-liebgott-2266871-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074083S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6648718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6648718","articleId":"6531655","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6531658,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfeng Li","affiliation":["College of Electronic and information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianfeng","lastName":"Li","id":"38025295100"},{"name":"Xiaofei Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electronic and information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279338600"},{"name":"Xin Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Gao","id":"38508244100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"6531658","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":517},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","MIMO radar","Arrays","Error analysis","Matrix decomposition","Data models","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","MIMO radar","remote sensing by radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint scheme","joint angle gain-phase error estimation","joint array gain-phase error estimation","bistatic MIMO radar","bistatic multiple-input multiple-output radar","trilinear decomposition","transmit direction matrix estimation","receive direction matrix estimation","optimization problem","array gain-phase angle estimation","array gain-phase error vectors","Lagrange multipliers","ESPRIT-like algorithm","automatically paired estimations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Angle estimation","gain-phase error","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar","trilinear decomposition"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we investigate the subject of joint angle and array gain-phase error estimation for bistatic multiple-input multiple-output radar, and propose a joint scheme for angle and array gain-phase error estimation based on trilinear decomposition.

Therefore, copper accumulation in the body gives rise to oxidative processes. Hence, this rare disease causes several disorders affecting tissues and organs. Neurological disorders lead to copper accumulation in the brain. Approximately 95% of individuals with neurological/psychiatric disorders show a visible symptom in their eyes known as Kayser-Fleischer ring. It is a golden-brown, sometimes orange or greyish, ring because of copper deposit in the cornea. In the medical screening, it is considered as a diagnostic sign of Wilson disease more than ever in individuals with neurological problems. The authors propose an innovative technique based on ocular biometric measurements to diagnose the pathology and the origin of a neurological disorder. An image processing algorithm detects the Kayser-Fleischer ring in the eye cornea through segmentation. Subsequently, biometric measurements provide further information on the severity level of pathology. The aim is to provide a non-invasive diagnostic technique to improve the accuracy of the current methods used in practice and to reduce the possible interpretation errors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531661/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531661/","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2013","accessionNumber":"13680953","volume":"13","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ocular Biometric Measurements to Diagnose Neurological Disorders Due to Wilson Disease","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ocular Biometric Measurements to Diagnose Neurological Disorders Due to Wilson Disease","sourcePdf":"jsen-morello-2268689-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114542S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6572817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6572817","articleId":"6531661","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6531666,"authors":[{"name":"Zheyu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6632912/6531666/6531666-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zheyu Zhang (S\u201912) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

To utilize the full potential of fast SiC devices, this paper proposes two gate assist circuits to actively suppress crosstalk on the basis of the intrinsic properties of SiC power devices. One gate assist circuit employs an auxiliary transistor in series with a capacitor to mitigate crosstalk by gate loop impedance reduction. The other gate assist circuit consists of two auxiliary transistors with a diode to actively control the gate voltage for crosstalk elimination. Based on CREE CMF20120D SiC MOSFETs, the experimental results show that both active gate drivers are effective to suppress crosstalk, enabling turn-on switching losses reduction by up to 17%, and negative spurious gate voltage minimization without the penalty of decreasing the switching speed. Furthermore, both gate assist circuits, even without a negative isolated power supply, are more effective in improving the switching behavior of SiC devices in comparison to the conventional gate driver with a -2 V turn-off gate voltage. Accordingly, the proposed active gate assist circuits are simple, efficient, and cost-effective solutions for crosstalk suppression.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6632912/06531666.pdf","startPage":"1986","endPage":"1997","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2268058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2268058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6632912","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Gate Driver for Crosstalk Suppression of SiC Devices in a Phase-Leg Configuration","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Switches","Crosstalk","Transient analysis","Silicon carbide","Transistors","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","crosstalk","driver circuits","losses","MOSFET","power semiconductor diodes","power semiconductor switches","silicon compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switching behavior","switching speed","negative spurious gate voltage minimization","turn-on switching losses reduction","CREE CMF20120D MOSFET","crosstalk elimination","diode","gate loop impedance reduction","capacitor","auxiliary transistor","one gate assist circuit","SiC power devices","two gate assist circuits","power device overstress","switching transient","high-switching-speed performance","phase-leg configuration","crosstalk suppression","SiC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active gate driver","crosstalk","phase-leg configuration","silicon carbide (SiC) device"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Active Gate Driver for Crosstalk Suppression of SiC Devices in a Phase-Leg Configuration","volume":"29","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6531666/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"13843327","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Gate Driver for Crosstalk Suppression of SiC Devices in a Phase-Leg Configuration","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2268058-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142702S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6632912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"6632912","articleId":"6531666","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6531667,"authors":[{"name":"Yalda Mohsenzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Yalda","lastName":"Mohsenzadeh","id":"37391871500"},{"name":"Hamid Sheikhzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic), Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Sheikhzadeh","id":"37264953500"},{"name":"Ali M.

Our proposed algorithm, called the relevance sample feature machine (RSFM), is able to simultaneously choose the relevance samples and also the relevance features for regression or classification problems. We propose a separable model in feature and sample domains. Adopting a Bayesian approach and using Gaussian priors, the learned model by RSFM is sparse in both sample and feature domains. The proposed algorithm is an extension of the standard RVM algorithm, which only opts for sparsity in the sample domain. Experimental comparisons on synthetic as well as benchmark data sets show that RSFM is successful in both feature selection (eliminating the irrelevant features) and accurate classification. The main advantages of our proposed algorithm are: less system complexity, better generalization and avoiding overfitting, and less computational cost during the testing stage.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2013.2260736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2013.2260736","startPage":"2241","endPage":"2254","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/6670128/06531667.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670128","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Relevance Sample-Feature Machine: A Sparse Bayesian Learning Approach to Joint Feature-Sample Selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"The Relevance Sample-Feature Machine: A Sparse Bayesian Learning Approach to Joint Feature-Sample Selection","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2013","volume":"43","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13914880","pubMedId":"23782842","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531667/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Relevance Sample-Feature Machine: A Sparse Bayesian Learning Approach to Joint Feature-Sample Selection","sourcePdf":"tcyb-sheikhzadeh-2260736-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04419S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","isNumber":"6670128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"40","articleId":"6531667","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6531671,"authors":[{"name":"Guodong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation and the Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control of Education Ministry of China, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Guodong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38247940700"},{"name":"Yi Shen","affiliation":["School of Automation and the Key Laboratory of Image Processing and Intelligent Control of Education Ministry of China, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Shen","id":"37274461700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-237X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2388"}],"articleNumber":"6531671","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":128,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1271},"abstract":"In this brief, we consider the exponential synchronization of chaotic memristive neural networks with time-varying delays using the Lyapunov functional method and inequality technique.

The organs in the human body produce different gases. During cleaning of the blood, which is transmitted to the lungs and into the blood gases, the breath passes through the alveoli. Human breath acetone concentration is very low (0.1-10 ppm). This paper aims to determine human blood glucose and HbA1c levels from exhaled breath as a non-invasive method with the help of an electronic nose system based on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors.

The method permits the efficient and accurate statistical characterization of observables (i.e., quantities of interest such as coupled voltages) that potentially vary rapidly and/or are discontinuous in the random variables (i.e., parameters that characterize uncertainty in a system's geometry, configuration, or excitation). The method achieves its efficiency and accuracy by recursively and adaptively dividing the domain of the random variables into subdomains using as a guide the decay rate of relative error in a polynomial chaos expansion of the observables. While constructing local polynomial expansions on each subdomain, a fast integral-equation-based deterministic field-cable-circuit simulator is used to compute the observable values at the collocation/integration points determined by the adaptive ME-PC scheme. The adaptive ME-PC scheme requires far fewer (computationally costly) deterministic simulations than traditional polynomial chaos collocation and Monte Carlo methods for computing averages, standard deviations, and probability density functions of rapidly varying observables. The efficiency and accuracy of the method are demonstrated via its applications to the statistical characterization of voltages in shielded/unshielded microwave amplifiers and magnetic fields induced on car tire pressure sensors.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2013.2265047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6681916","startPage":"1154","endPage":"1168","pdfPath":"/iel7/15/6681916/06531677.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2013.2265047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Multi-Element Probabilistic Collocation Method for Statistical EMC/EMI Characterization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Electromagnetic compatibility","Electromagnetic interference","Computational modeling","Approximation methods","Random variables","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","cables (electric)","electric field integral equations","electromagnetic compatibility","electromagnetic interference","magnetic field integral equations","magnetic shielding","microwave amplifiers","Monte Carlo methods","polynomials","pressure sensors","probability","random processes","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability density function","car tire pressure sensor","magnetic field","shielded-unshielded microwave amplifier","Monte Carlo method","fast integral-equation-based deterministic field-cable-circuit simulator","polynomial chaos collocation expansion","relative error decay rate","geometry","random discontinuous variable","electromagnetic interference","electromagnetic compatibility","ME-PC method","statistical EMC-EMI characterization","adaptive multielement probabilistic collocation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive algorithm","electromagnetic compatibility and interference (EMC/EMI)","generalized polynomial chaos (gPC)","multi-dimensional integral","multi-element (ME)","probabilistic collocation (PC)","sparse grid (SG)","tensor product (TP)","tolerance analysis","uncertainty quantification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2013","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Multi-Element Probabilistic Collocation Method for Statistical EMC/EMI Characterization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531677/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6531677/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13952452","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Multi-Element Probabilistic Collocation Method for Statistical EMC/EMI Characterization","sourcePdf":"temc-yucel-2265047-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104329S","chronDate":"Dec.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"6681916","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6681916","articleId":"6531677","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6531678,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Instead, this paper presents alternative algorithms for P and M class PMUs, which use adaptive filtering techniques in real time up to 10-kHz sample rates, allowing consistent accuracy to be maintained across a \u00b133% frequency range.

The conventional dc droop control method is realized by linearly reducing the dc output voltage as the output current increases. This method has two limitations. First, with the consideration of line resistance in a droop-controlled dc microgrid, since the output voltage of each converter cannot be exactly the same, the output current sharing accuracy is degraded. Second, the dc-bus voltage deviation increases with the load due to the droop action. In this paper, in order to improve the performance of the dc microgrid operation, a low-bandwidth communication (LBC)-based improved droop control method is proposed. In contrast with the conventional approach, the control system does not require a centralized secondary controller. Instead, it uses local controllers and the LBC network to exchange information between converter units. The droop controller is employed to achieve independent operation, and the average voltage and current controllers are used in each converter to simultaneously enhance the current sharing accuracy and restore the dc bus voltage. All of the controllers are realized locally, and the LBC system is only used for changing the values of the dc voltage and current. Hence, a decentralized control scheme is accomplished. The simulation test based on MATLAB/Simulink and the experimental validation based on a 2 \u00d7 2.2 kW prototype were implemented to demonstrate the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2266419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2266419","startPage":"1800","endPage":"1812","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6632912/06531679.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6632912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Droop Control Method for DC Microgrids Based on Low Bandwidth Communication With DC Bus Voltage Restoration and Enhanced Current Sharing Accuracy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Droop Control Method for DC Microgrids Based on Low Bandwidth Communication With DC Bus Voltage Restoration and Enhanced Current Sharing Accuracy","volume":"29","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2013","accessionNumber":"13843281","publicationDate":"April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6531679/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Droop Control Method for DC Microgrids Based on Low Bandwidth Communication With DC Bus Voltage Restoration and Enhanced Current Sharing Accuracy","sourcePdf":"tpel-lu-2266419-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084241S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6632912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"622","xplore-issue":"6632912","articleId":"6531679","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6531680,"authors":[{"name":"Jiahu Qin","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Computer Network, Shandong Computer Science Center, Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6613560/6531680/6531680-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiahu Qin (M'12) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2003 and 2005, respectively.

It is finally shown that the proposed algorithms are feasible in achieving the desired coordination behavior provided the interaction topologies satisfy the weakest possible connectivity conditions. Such conditions relate only to the structure of the interactions among agents while irrelevant to their magnitudes and thus are easy to verify.

A novel phase current reconstruction scheme, with reduced immeasurable area and common mode voltage, is proposed in this paper. A tristate pulse-width modulation technique has been employed, in which three adjacent switching states are used to construct the reference voltage. The active switching states are arranged at the edge and the center of a PWM cycle. Fixed sampling and simultaneous three-phase currents can be easily achieved with very little hardware and software requirements. A detailed analysis of the effects of nonidealities leads to regional modifications of the switching sequence resulting in almost the whole hexagon as the feasible area. The usefulness of the proposed reconstruction algorithm has been verified by experimental results obtained from a 4-kW induction motor drive system. Smooth transitions between the redundant and fault-tolerant modes were observed.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2013.2266408","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6603319/06531682.pdf","startPage":"1542","endPage":"1550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2013.2266408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6603319","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Three-Phase Current Reconstruction Technique Using Single DC Current Sensor Based on TSPWM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Three-Phase Current Reconstruction Technique Using Single DC Current Sensor Based on TSPWM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531682/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","volume":"29","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531682/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2013","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"13795071","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Three-Phase Current Reconstruction Technique Using Single DC Current Sensor Based on TSPWM","sourcePdf":"tpel-lu-2266408-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083595S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6603319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6603319","articleId":"6531682","onlineDate":"13 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-22"},{"_id":6531683,"authors":[{"name":"David Reusch","affiliation":["Efficient Power Conversion Corporation, El Segundo, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6632912/6531683/6531683-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["David Reusch (S\u201909\u2013M\u201912) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA, in 2004, 2006, and 2012, respectively.","He was a Research Assistant with the Center for Power Electronics Systems (CPES), where he was the recipient of the Bradley Graduate Fellowship and the NSF CPES Research Fellowship.

The most efficient approach to aggregation is organizing the network into clusters. However, this approach which achieves good performance in periodic data collecting applications is proved to be inappropriate for event-driven applications, such as real-time data gathering. In fact, in this case maintaining clusters turned to be very expensive in term of message overhead. To deal with this problem, we propose a clustering scheme suitable for event-driven applications. We show that if the structure is adapted to the occurrence of events, structured approaches can provide good results in real-time WSNs. Simulation results show that our approach performs well both in aggregation gain and energy consumption.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2013.75","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2013.75","startPage":"48","endPage":"55","pdfPath":"/iel7/6512431/6531716/06531737.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531737","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531737/","displayDocTitle":"An Event-Driven Clustering Scheme for Data Aggregation in Real-Time Wireless Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"25-28 March 2013","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"13581015","publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6531737/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Event-Driven Clustering Scheme for Data Aggregation in Real-Time Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"4953a048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056835S","chronDate":"25-28 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6512431","isNumber":"6531716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6512431","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6531716","articleId":"6531737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6531745,"authors":[{"name":"Rainer Poisel","affiliation":["Institute for IT-Security Research, St. Polten University of Applied Sciences, Saint Poelten, Austria"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Poisel","id":"37541706800"},{"name":"Marlies Rybnicek","affiliation":["Institute for IT-Security Research, St. Polten University of Applied Sciences, Saint Poelten, Austria"],"firstName":"Marlies","lastName":"Rybnicek","id":"38243811300"},{"name":"Simon Tjoa","affiliation":["Institute for IT-Security Research, St. Polten University of Applied Sciences, Saint Poelten, Austria"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Tjoa","id":"37296797900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5550-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4953-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1550-445X"}],"articleNumber":"6531745","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":546},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531745","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer crime","Games","Libraries","Organizations","Complexity theory","Information technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","critical infrastructures","digital simulation","game theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game-based simulation","distributed denial-of-service attack mechanism","distributed denial-of-service defense mechanism","DDoS attack mechanisms","DDoS defense mechanism","CI","critical infrastructure sectors","ICT components","cyber attack impact forecasting","cyber attack impact estimation","agent-based modeling-and-simulation","game-theoretic elements","anticipation games"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed Denial of Service","DDoS","Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation","Taxonomy","Ontology","Attack/Defense Graph","Anticipation Games"]}],"abstract":"The outage of Critical Infrastructures (CI) can have devastating impacts on our society, economic welfare and political stability. One risk that is often encountered in critical infrastructure sectors is its high dependence on ICT components and the complex interdependencies between shared services. Recent cyber attacks (such as Stuxnet, Flame, Gauss) outline the high vulnerability of ICT components which build the foundation of today's Critical Infrastructures. The complexity and fast-changing threat environment pose an enormous challenge for estimating and forecasting the impacts of cyber attacks on such systems. In order to address this challenge, modeling and simulation techniques are used. Especially, Agent-based Modeling and Simulation provides a powerful technique to represent dynamic behavior of various actors. In this paper, we introduce a concept to model and simulate Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) on critical infrastructures. For representing the interactions and the underlying decisions of the individual agents, we decided to combine Agent-based Modeling and Simulation with game-theoretic elements (such as Anticipation Games). In course of the paper we provide a short motivational example to outline how our approach can be applied in a real world scenario. Furthermore, the architecture of our research prototype is given.","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2013.66","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2013.66","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6512431/6531716/06531745.pdf","startPage":"114","endPage":"120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Game-based Simulation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack and Defense Mechanisms of Critical Infrastructures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 March 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Game-based Simulation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack and Defense Mechanisms of Critical Infrastructures","conferenceDate":"25-28 March 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13581023","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531745/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Game-based Simulation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack and Defense Mechanisms of Critical Infrastructures","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"4953a114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074745S","chronDate":"25-28 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6512431","isNumber":"6531716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6512431","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6531716","articleId":"6531745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6531746,"authors":[{"name":"Suleiman Y.

Android has surpassed other mobile platforms as the most popular whilst also witnessing a dramatic increase in malware targeting the platform. A worrying trend that is emerging is the increasing sophistication of Android malware to evade detection by traditional signature-based scanners. As such, Android app marketplaces remain at risk of hosting malicious apps that could evade detection before being downloaded by unsuspecting users. Hence, in this paper we present an effective approach to alleviate this problem based on Bayesian classification models obtained from static code analysis. The models are built from a collection of code and app characteristics that provide indicators of potential malicious activities. The models are evaluated with real malware samples in the wild and results of experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2013.88","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6512431/6531716/06531746.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"128","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2013.88","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Android Malware Detection Approach Using Bayesian Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 March 2013","displayDocTitle":"A New Android Malware Detection Approach Using Bayesian Classification","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6531746/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13581024","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531746/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Android Malware Detection Approach Using Bayesian Classification","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"4953a121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10184S","chronDate":"25-28 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6512431","isNumber":"6531716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6512431","citationCount":"116","xplore-issue":"6531716","articleId":"6531746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6531749,"authors":[{"name":"Amitabha Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Amitabha","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37543635600"},{"name":"Martin Collier","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Collier","id":"37282051300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5550-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4953-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-445X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1550-445X"}],"articleNumber":"6531749","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Optical switches","Program processors","Adaptation models","Hardware","Ports (Computers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decision making","matrix algebra","optical crosstalk","optical interconnections","parallel machines","switching networks","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity routing algorithm","rearrangeable switching networks","routing algorithms","network structure","crosspoint reduction","switching element","matrix based abstraction model","conflict free routing paths","input-output request","submatrices","subnetworks","input permutation","matrix cells","switching elements","binary values","routing decision control","serial time complexity","parallel machine","optical domain crosstalk free routing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rearrangeable Networks","Permutation","Interconnection Networks","Routing Tags","Complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531749","abstract":"Rearrangeable switching networks have been a topic of interest for a long time among the research community. Routing algorithms for this class of networks have attracted lots of researchers along with other related areas, such as modification of the networks structure, crosspoints reduction etc. In this paper a new routing algorithm is presented for symmetric rearrangeable networks built with 2 \u00d7 2 switching element. A new matrix based abstraction model is derived to determine conflict free routing paths for each input-output request. Each stage of a network is mapped into a set of sub-matrices and number of matrices in each stage correspond to number of subnetworks in that stage. Once the input permutation is given, matrix cells are populated with binary values depending on the position of the switching elements in the actual hardware and their mapped matrix cells. These binary values control the routing decision in the underlying hardware. This new routing algorithm is capable of connection setup for partial permutation, m\u0305 = \u03c1N, where N is the total input numbers and m\u0305 is the number of active inputs. Overall the serial time complexity of this method is O(NlogN)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n and O(m\u0305logN) where all N inputs are active and with m\u0305 <; N active inputs respectively.

The problem is known for its high complexity and has been shown computationally hard to solve to optimality. Additionally, several optimization objectives can be formulated and sought for the problem, namely, windows fitness, clashes fitness, time requirement fitness, and resource usage fitness.

We evaluated the performance of the SSGA through a suite of instances generated with the STK simulation toolkit.

Its key feature is the online selection of the number of mixture components together with the fitting parameter of each component. With many components the description is accurate. However, the computational burden increases as well. The best compromise between the description accuracy and the computational complexity is given by a derivation of the Minimum Message Length (MML) information criterion. The normal network behavior is assumed to be interpreted by the cluster with the highest covariance matrix, while the other smaller components are considered representing anomalies. We tested our technique with the well known KDD99 Cup data set, in order to clearly compare our findings with the other state of the art methods.

However, most reconfigurations usually require a hard coded reimplementation, resynthesis, and the download of a new bit file to the target platform, which also requires an additional host PC. Contrary with the presented solution, it is possible to configure the multilayer perceptron's parameters during runtime via a software interface. This approach allows the multilayer perceptron to be adapted to nearly any application. The developed design combines the flexibility of a software solution to generate and comfortably reconfigure the multilayer perceptron as well as the high performance of a hardware solution. %The investigation of hardware utilization and performance of a running prototype st\u00fctzt%Finally, the hardware utilization and performance are investigated. As proof of concept, a running prototype has been realized, which shows the design to be highly flexible and with good performance while the hardware resource consumption is kept minimal.","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2013.19","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6512431/6531716/06531787.pdf","startPage":"429","endPage":"436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2013.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531716","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Highly Integrable FPGA-Based Runtime-Configurable Multilayer Perceptron","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531787/","displayDocTitle":"A Highly Integrable FPGA-Based Runtime-Configurable Multilayer Perceptron","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531787/","publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","conferenceDate":"25-28 March 2013","accessionNumber":"13581064","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Highly Integrable FPGA-Based Runtime-Configurable Multilayer Perceptron","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"4953a429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061073S","chronDate":"25-28 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6512431","isNumber":"6531716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6512431","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6531716","articleId":"6531787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6531796,"authors":[{"name":"Marco A.M.

However, due to the ad hoc nature of the network and especially to resources constraints of the sensor nodes, this cooperation is not trivial, requiring a number of retransmissions thus wasting precious resources. In this paper the use of cooperative multiple input multiple output (MIMO) techniques is proposed to overcome transmission problems, ensuring a reliable and more efficient communication link with less retransmissions. Extensive simulation experiments support the proposal, and the results highlight the benefits in using MIMO to deliver messages from static to mobile nodes in wireless sensor networks.","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2013.107","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6512431/6531716/06531796.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2013.107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531716","startPage":"500","endPage":"505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using MIMO Techniques to Enhance Communication Among Static and Mobile Nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using MIMO Techniques to Enhance Communication Among Static and Mobile Nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531796/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-28 March 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13581073","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6531796/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using MIMO Techniques to Enhance Communication Among Static and Mobile Nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"4953a500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056531S","chronDate":"25-28 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6512431","isNumber":"6531716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6512431","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6531716","articleId":"6531796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6531863,"authors":[{"name":"Marcial P.

Two time domain paradigms exist for creating the resource allocation matrix: channel-dependent and proportional fairness. The channel dependent paradigm considers mainly the channel quality of UEs, allowing for users with high channel quality to get assigned most resources. The proportional fairness paradigm allocates resources to users based on the ratio of their channel condition over their lifelong service rate, allowing for users with low channel conditions to get some resources, but fewer than those with better channel conditions. Even though the proportional fairness paradigm's main focus is to achieve high system throughput without starving any user, it does not account for QoS requirements in many scenarios especially when UEs with high priority data pending for transmission have worst channel conditions than those with lower priority data. In this paper we propose a QoS-aware resource allocation paradigm for LTE uplink scheduling that gives more advantage to UEs having high priority data, while not starving other users. The proposed approach is scalable and mobility aware where the dynamic nature of the network is taken into account while devising the algorithm. When simulated using NS3, the proposed algorithm produced very promising results and outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches presented in literature.","doi":"10.1109/AINA.2013.38","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 27th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications (AINA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6512431/6531716/06531875.pdf","startPage":"1097","endPage":"1104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2013.38","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A QoS-Aware Uplink Scheduling Paradigm for LTE Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531875","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-28 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531875/","displayDocTitle":"A QoS-Aware Uplink Scheduling Paradigm for LTE Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13581152","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531875/","conferenceDate":"25-28 March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A QoS-Aware Uplink Scheduling Paradigm for LTE Networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"4953b097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089962S","chronDate":"25-28 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6512431","isNumber":"6531716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6512431","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6531716","articleId":"6531875","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6531948,"authors":[{"name":"Javier A.

A total of about 496,000 interconnects were tested over a wide current density and temperature range (j = 3.4 to 41.2 mA/\u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, T = 200 to 350\u00b0C) to analyze the detailed behavior of the current density exponent n and the activation energy E\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</sub>\n. The results for the critical V1M1 downstream interface indicate a reduction from n = 1.55\u00b10.10 to n = 1.15\u00b10.15 when lowering the temperature towards 200\u00b0C for Cu-based interconnects. This suggests that the electromigration downstream early failure mechanism is shifting from a mix of nucleation-controlled (n = 2) and growth-controlled (n = 1) to a fully growth-controlled mode, assisted by the increased thermal stress at lower temperatures (especially at use conditions). For Cu(Mn)-based interconnects, a drop from n = 2.00\u00b10.07 to n = 1.64\u00b10.2 was found, indicating additional effects of a superimposed incubation time. Furthermore, at lower current densities, the E\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</sub>\n value seems to drop for both Cu and Cu(Mn) interconnects by a slight, but significant amount of 0.1 - 0.2eV.

Proper choice of experimental conditions eliminates the impact of averaging effects and disturbs on the transients, enabling clear detection of single charge emission events from/to the tunnel oxide of sub-30nm NAND Flash cells. A stochastic model for the discrete emission process was developed from experimental data, demonstrating that number fluctuation of charges trapped in the tunnel oxide and the statistical nature of their emission dynamics strongly affect the post-cycling data retention performance of the arrays. These results pave the way for further analyses of NAND Flash reliability, where the behavior of single electrons and defects can be monitored and facilitate detailed assessments of the fundamental scaling challenges arising from the discrete nature of charge trapping/detrapping.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2013.6531977","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium

Considering a 1-TAT model we study the SILC statistics under stationary and dynamic retention conditions. Our results show that SILC is dispersed over the channel area due to non-uniform electrostatics in nanoscale devices. Further, the floating gate poly-silicon granularity plays a major role in determining the SILC distribution, depending on the gate polarity. Dynamic charge loss simulations highlight that the impact of 3D electrostatics is dominant over the cell-to-cell variability. Finally, we analyze the electron emission statistics on a single cell, showing that this gives rise to a lower SILC dispersion than an analytical Poisson charge loss statistics. Our results are fundamental to determine the degree of accuracy of 1D models for the post-cycling charge loss statistics simulation in nanoscale Flash memories.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of statistical variability and 3D electrostatics on post-cycling anomalous charge loss in nanoscale Flash memories","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS)","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2013.6531980","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523362/6531927/06531980.pdf","startPage":"3B.4.1","endPage":"3B.4.6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2013.6531980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531927","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Impact of statistical variability and 3D electrostatics on post-cycling anomalous charge loss in nanoscale Flash memories","conferenceDate":"14-18 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6531980/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13581499","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of statistical variability and 3D electrostatics on post-cycling anomalous charge loss in nanoscale Flash memories","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3b04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084323S","chronDate":"14-18 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523362","isNumber":"6531927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523362","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6531927","articleId":"6531980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6531982,"authors":[{"name":"Kousuke Miyaji","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Communication Engineering, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Kousuke","lastName":"Miyaji","id":"37394979200"},{"name":"Daisuke Kobayashi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Communication Engineering, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Daisuke","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37061702500"},{"name":"Ken Takeuchi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Communication Engineering, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Takeuchi","id":"37323717800"},{"name":"Shinji Miyano","affiliation":["Semiconductor Technology Academic Research Center, Yokoyama, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinji","lastName":"Miyano","id":"37360086300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0113-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0112-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0111-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1938-1891"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1541-7026"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1541-7026"}],"articleNumber":"6531982","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Logic gates","Random access memory","Stress","Thermal stability","Voltage measurement","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SRAM chips","transistor circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static noise margin improvement","6T-SRAM","post-process local electron injected asymmetric pass gate transistor","SNM improvement","local electron injected asymmetric pass gate transistor","local electron injected asymmetric PG transistor","word-line voltage","pseudo disturb","thermal retention stress","size 40 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SRAM","Variability","Static noise margin","Hot electron injection","Self-repair"]}],"abstract":"Improvement of the static noise margin (SNM) in 40nm 6T-SRAM with local electron injected asymmetric pass gate (PG) transistor is analyzed.

We have studied the strength and the lifetime of the dielectric to breakdown by means of a Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) experiment performed at 200\u00b0C and the trapping effects induced by applying a positive gate voltage stress. Additionally, for the first time, we have studied the effect of the on-state stress as a function of the drain voltage. The results show that 1) Based on a Time Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) evaluation, an applied gate voltage stress of +6V for the lifetime of 20 years can be extrapolated at 200\u00b0C. 2) By fitting with a power law, applying +1V gate voltage for 20 years leads to a threshold voltage shift of 0.2V. This guarantees a good reliability margin when these devices are used in cascode switching circuit applications. 3) A new mechanism of high junction temperature thermal de-trapping was observed during a high drain bias stress.","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2013.6531987","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523362/6531927/06531987.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2013.6531987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531927","startPage":"3C.5.1","endPage":"3C.5.7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comprehensive investigation of on-state stress on D-mode AlGaN/GaN MIS-HEMTs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6531987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comprehensive investigation of on-state stress on D-mode AlGaN/GaN MIS-HEMTs","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6531987/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 April 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13581506","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6531987/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comprehensive investigation of on-state stress on D-mode AlGaN/GaN MIS-HEMTs","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3c05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073909S","chronDate":"14-18 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523362","isNumber":"6531927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523362","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6531927","articleId":"6531987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6531992,"authors":[{"name":"G.

At equivalent EOT, proposed stacks provide improved NBTI and similar PBTI when compared to conventional Chem-Ox IL based HKMG stacks. EOT scaling achieved by RTP thermal IL scaling shows lower rate of increase in NBTI and PBTI when compared to Chem-Ox IL scavenged stacks. Impact of Nitrogen and role of post HK nitridation are studied. Physical mechanism of improved BTI in proposed stacks is discussed in detail.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523362/6531927/06532014.pdf","startPage":"4C.2.1","endPage":"4C.2.10","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS)","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2013.6532014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2013.6532014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531927","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HKMG process impact on N, P BTI: Role of thermal IL scaling, IL/HK integration and post HK nitridation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Stress","Stress measurement","Hafnium compounds","Gate leakage","Insulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-k dielectric thin films","MOSFET","nitridation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HKMG process impact","IL-HK Integration","post HK nitridation","interfacial layer","high-k metal gate process impact","equivalent oxide thickness","MOSFET gate stacks","Chem-Ox IL based HKMG stacks","EOT scaling","RTP thermal IL scaling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["HKMG","Chem-Ox IL","thermal IL","EOT scaling","IL scaling","gate leakage","mobility","NBTI","PBTI","flicker noise","DCIV","SILC","trap generation","charge trapping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"HKMG process impact on N, P BTI: Role of thermal IL scaling, IL/HK integration and post HK nitridation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6532014/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13581533","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","conferenceDate":"14-18 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HKMG process impact on N, P BTI: Role of thermal IL scaling, IL/HK integration and post HK nitridation","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4c02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.191384S","chronDate":"14-18 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523362","isNumber":"6531927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523362","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6531927","articleId":"6532014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6532017,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Although RRAM is capable of lower energy consumption and substantially more cycles than Flash memory, comprehending and maintaining its ability to store data under stressed conditions remains the key challenge for mainstream acceptance. This in large part is due to the filamentary nature of the RRAM element at the nanoscale. A filament-based resistive memory is based on the formation of current-conducting path (filaments) from defects, e.g., oxygen vacancies. The defects often lead to trap-limited current conduction. Without proper process control or RESET algorithms, unwanted defects may be added near the filaments under device stress, further aggravating the resistance instabilities.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","Stress","Thermal stability","Noise","Stability analysis","Market research","Electrodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resistance instability","filament-based resistive memory","resistive random access memory","nonvolatile memory technology","energy consumption","flash memory","RRAM element","current-conducting path","oxygen vacancies","RESET algorithms","trap-limited current conduction","device stress"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["resistive memory","RRAM","ReRAM","oxygen vacancies","trap-limited conduction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532040","doi":"10.1109/IRPS.2013.6532040","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523362/6531927/06532040.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRPS.2013.6532040","startPage":"5E.1.1","endPage":"5E.1.7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6531927","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Reliability Physics Symposium (IRPS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resistance instabilities in a filament-based resistive memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Resistance instabilities in a filament-based resistive memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532040/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 April 2013","conferenceDate":"14-18 April 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6532040/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13581559","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resistance instabilities in a filament-based resistive memory","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5e01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084024S","chronDate":"14-18 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523362","isNumber":"6531927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523362","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6531927","articleId":"6532040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6532041,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Constant Voltage Stress is applied on a large amount of samples at various temperatures. Data are collected and analyzed on a statistical basis. The SET dependence to the RESET conditions is investigated and correlated to the length of the induced depleted gap along the conductive filament. The conduction mechanism of the HRS is correlated to the failure/SET process of the RRAM device through a voltage acceleration model.

The baseband system level design is done using Matlab/Simulink and the implementation is done using the TMS320C6713 DSK from Texas Instruments Inc. Cooperation of Matlab IDE and Code Composer Studio IDE allow for automatic code generation directly from Simulink blocks, offering a flexible way from system level design and simulation to actual implementation and verification. The wireless (RF) part is based on conventional components. For all multicarrier schemes we explore most of the basic building blocks that constitute them. The implemented testbed is intended primarily for educational demonstration and experimentation purposes offering the means for highlighting and studying several concepts and phenomena regarding not only the modulation schemes but the wireless link as a whole. Typical results concerning the experimental demonstration, evaluation and verification of the testbed are presented.","doi":"10.1109/EDERC.2012.6532251","publicationTitle":"2012 5th European DSP Education and Research Conference (EDERC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 5th European DSP Education and Research Conference (EDERC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526843/6532205/06532251.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDERC.2012.6532251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6532205","startPage":"183","endPage":"187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM, SC-FDMA AND MC-CDMA educational wireless transceivers using Matlab and the TMS320C6713 DSK","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532251","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OFDM, SC-FDMA AND MC-CDMA educational wireless transceivers using Matlab and the TMS320C6713 DSK","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Sept. 2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532251/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-14 Sept. 2012","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","accessionNumber":"13581327","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6532251/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM, SC-FDMA AND MC-CDMA educational wireless transceivers using Matlab and the TMS320C6713 DSK","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"page183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039372S","chronDate":"13-14 Sept. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6526843","isNumber":"6532205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526843","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6532205","articleId":"6532251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6532283,"authors":[{"name":"Paulo Ricardo Possa","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Microelectronics, University of Mons, Mons, Belgium"],"firstName":"Paulo Ricardo","lastName":"Possa","id":"37085590261"},{"name":"Sidi Ahmed Mahmoudi","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Mons, Mons, Belgium"],"firstName":"Sidi Ahmed","lastName":"Mahmoudi","id":"38549173500"},{"name":"Naim Harb","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Microelectronics, University of Mons, Mons, Belgium"],"firstName":"Naim","lastName":"Harb","id":"37594771100"},{"name":"Carlos Valderrama","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Microelectronics, University of Mons, Mons, Belgium"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Valderrama","id":"37421631100"},{"name":"Pierre Manneback","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of Mons, Mons, Belgium"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Manneback","id":"37299788000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"6532283","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2487},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Image edge detection","Computer architecture","Detectors","Instruction sets","Feature extraction","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","graphics processing units","real-time systems","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiresolution FPGA based architecture","real time edge detection","corner detection","flexible parameterizable architecture","image processing","video processing","reduced latency","variable input resolution","feature detection","Canny edge detector","Harris corner detector","neighborhood extractors","mathematical complexity","memory requirements","GPU based architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Reconfigurable hardware","graphics processors","real-time systems","computer vision","edge and feature detection"]}],"abstract":"This work presents a new flexible parameterizable architecture for image and video processing with reduced latency and memory requirements, supporting a variable input resolution.

Also, algorithm simplifications are employed to reduce mathematical complexity, memory requirements, and latency without losing reliability. Furthermore, we present the proposed architecture implementation on an FPGA-based platform and its analogous optimized implementation on a GPU-based architecture for comparison. A performance analysis of the FPGA and the GPU implementations, and an extra CPU reference implementation, shows the competitive throughput of the proposed architecture even at a much lower clock frequency than those of the GPU and the CPU.

Compared to correctly rounded multipliers, i.e., those returning the nearest machine representable number, faithfully rounded multipliers use considerably less silicon area, typically by implementing a truncation scheme within the partial product array. A number of such heuristically inspired schemes exist in the literature, however their use in industrial practice is hampered by the absence of verification, and exhaustive simulation is typically infeasible, e.g., a 32 bit multiplier requires 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">64</sup>\n simulations. We present three truncated multiplier schemes which subsume the majority of existing schemes and derive both closed form necessary and sufficient conditions for faithful rounding. For two of the schemes we provide closed form expressions for the bit vectors giving rise to the worst-case error and the probability of encountering these inputs during Monte-Carlo simulation. From these expressions, we show how HDL code can be created that performs correct-by-construction faithfully rounded multiplication. We also present a method for truncating an arbitrary array while maintaining faithful rounding, creating two novel truncated multiplier schemes in the process.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2013.126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/6891494/06532286.pdf","startPage":"2513","endPage":"2525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6891494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2013.126","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Systematic Creation of Faithfully Rounded Truncated Multipliers and Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"On the Systematic Creation of Faithfully Rounded Truncated Multipliers and Arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532286/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14564298","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6532286/","volume":"63","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Systematic Creation of Faithfully Rounded Truncated Multipliers and Arrays","sourcePdf":"tc-drane-126-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130337S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6891494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6891494","articleId":"6532286","onlineDate":"14 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6532287,"authors":[{"name":"Arvind Sridhar","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Embedded Systems Laboratory (ESL), Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6891494/6532287/6532287-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arvind Sridhar (S\u201907) received the BEng degree in electronics and communication engineering from the College of Engineering Guindy, Anna University, Chennai, India, in 2006, and the MASc degree in electronics from Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada, in 2009.

Development of such devices requires accurate and fast thermal simulators suitable for early-stage design. To this end, we present 3D-ICE, a compact transient thermal model (CTTM), for liquid-cooled ICs. 3D-ICE was first advanced incorporating the 4-resistor model-based CTTM (4RM-based CTTM). Later, it was enhanced to speed up simulations and to include complex heat sink geometries such as pin fins using the new 2 resistor model (2RM-based CTTM). In this paper, we extend the 3D-ICE model to include liquid-cooled ICs with multi-port cavities, i.e., cavities with more than one inlet and one outlet ports, and non-straight microchannels. Simulation studies using a realistic 3D multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC) with a 4-port microchannel cavity highlight the impact of using 4-port cavity on temperature and also demonstrate the superior performance of 2RM-based CTTM compared to 4RM-based CTTM. We also present an extensive review of existing literature and the derivation of the 3D-ICE model, creating a comprehensive study of liquid-cooled ICs and their thermal simulation from the perspective of computer systems design. Finally, the accuracy of 3D-ICE has been evaluated against measurements from a real liquid-cooled 3D-IC, which is the first such validation of a simulator of this genre. Results show strong agreement (average error \\lt 10%), demonstrating that 3D-ICE is an effective tool for early-stage thermal-aware design of liquid-cooled 2D-/3D-ICs.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2013.127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/6891494/06532287.pdf","startPage":"2576","endPage":"2589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2013.127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6891494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D-ICE: A Compact Thermal Model for Early-Stage Design of Liquid-Cooled ICs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532287/","displayDocTitle":"3D-ICE: A Compact Thermal Model for Early-Stage Design of Liquid-Cooled ICs","volume":"63","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14564306","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6532287/","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D-ICE: A Compact Thermal Model for Early-Stage Design of Liquid-Cooled ICs","sourcePdf":"tc-sridhar-127-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088439S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6891494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6891494","articleId":"6532287","onlineDate":"14 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6532289,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The proposed method describes GF arithmetic circuits in the form of hierarchical graph structures, where nodes represent sub-circuits whose functions are defined by arithmetic formulae over GFs, and edges represent data dependency between nodes. In this paper, we first introduce the application of graph representation to arithmetic circuits over extension fields of \\mbi GF(\\mbi p\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\\mbi m</sup>\n) (\\mbi p \u2265 2) and composite fields, which are commonly used in the design of cryptographic processors. The newly proposed graph representation can be formally verified through symbolic computation techniques based on polynomial reduction and Gr\u00f6bner basis. We then demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach through an experimental design of a 128-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) datapath including multiplicative inversion circuits over the composite field \\mbi GF(((2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n).

By utilizing nondominated sorting mechanisms and composite differential evolution (CoDE), a reference-point-based nondominated sorting composite differential evolution (RP-NSCDE) is developed to tackle the multiobjective identification of controlling areas in the neuronal network. The proposed RP-NSCDE shows its promising performance in terms of accuracy and convergence speed, in comparison to nondominated sorting genetic algorithms II. The proposed method is also compared with other representative statistical methods in the complex network theory, single objective, and constraint optimization methods to illustrate its effectiveness and reliability. It is shown that there exists a tradeoff between minimizing two objectives, and therefore pareto fronts (PFs) can be plotted. The developed approaches and findings can also be applied to coordination control of various kinds of real-world complex networks including biological networks and social networks, and so

Numerical results and experimental measurements both show a consistency with our proposed theory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"70% Energy Saving in Wireless Positioning Systems: Non-Data-Bearing OFDM Transmission Replaces Non-Pulse-Shaping PN Transmission","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2013.2265186","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7128446/06532303.pdf","startPage":"664","endPage":"674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2013.2265186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7128446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532303","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532303/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"70% Energy Saving in Wireless Positioning Systems: Non-Data-Bearing OFDM Transmission Replaces Non-Pulse-Shaping PN Transmission","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6532303/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15221985","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"New York Institute of Technology"},{"fundingName":"Alberta Innovates Technology Futures"},{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingName":"Canada Research Chair Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"70% Energy Saving in Wireless Positioning Systems: Non-Data-Bearing OFDM Transmission Replaces Non-Pulse-Shaping PN Transmission","sourcePdf":"jsyst-wang-2265186-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083097S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7128446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7128446","articleId":"6532303","onlineDate":"14 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6532306,"authors":[{"name":"Eren \u015ea\u015fo\u011flu","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, Lausanne, VD, CH"],"bio":{"p":["Eren \u015ea\u015fo\u011flu received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Bogazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2005.

Hidden Markov models utilizing a Gaussian probability distribution are proposed as an anomaly detection tool for GTs components. The use of this technique is shown to allow the modeling of the dynamics of GTs despite a lack of high-frequency data. This allows the early detection of developing faults and avoids costly outages due to asset Failure. These models are implemented as part of an MAS, using a proposed extension of an established power system ontology, for fault detection of gas turbines. The multiagent system is shown to be applicable through a case study and comparison to an existing system utilizing historic data from a combined-cycle gas turbine plant provided by an industrial partner.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/6710259/06532308.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2013.2251539","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2013.2251539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6710259","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Agent-Based Implementation of Hidden Markov Models for Gas Turbine Condition Monitoring","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Turbines","Condition monitoring","Training","Multi-agent systems","Fault detection","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","fault diagnosis","gas turbines","Gaussian distribution","hidden Markov models","mechanical engineering computing","multi-agent systems","ontologies (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["agent-based implementation","hidden Markov models","gas turbine engine condition monitoring","multiagent system","GT engines","Gaussian probability distribution","anomaly detection tool","GT components","GT dynamics","high-frequency data","asset failure","MAS","power system ontology","fault detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Condition monitoring","fault detection","gas turbines (GTs)","Gaussian distributions","hidden Markov models (HMMs)","multiagent system (MAS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"An Agent-Based Implementation of Hidden Markov Models for Gas Turbine Condition Monitoring","volume":"44","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6532308/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14031821","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Agent-Based Implementation of Hidden Markov Models for Gas Turbine Condition Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tsmc-kenyon-2251539-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078361S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"6710259","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6710259","articleId":"6532308","onlineDate":"14 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6532314,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Romero","affiliation":["EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Carlos Romero received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2013.","From 2003 to 2008, he was with the National University of Colombia, Bogota, Colombia, and later as Chief of Engineering of the Colombian Satellite Program.

As a training method a combination of a pilot-assisted scheme and a biased signaling scheme is considered. The achievable rates of successive decoding (SD) receivers based on the linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE) channel estimation are analyzed in the large-system limit, by using the replica method under the assumption of replica symmetry. It is shown that negligible pilot information is best in terms of the achievable rates of the SD receivers in the large-system limit. The obtained analytical formulas of the achievable rates can improve the existing lower bound on the capacity of the MIMO channel with no channel state information (CSI), derived by Hassibi and Hochwald, for all SNRs. The comparison between the obtained bound and a high-SNR approximation of the channel capacity, derived by Zheng and Tse, implies that the high-SNR approximation is unreliable unless quite high SNR is considered. Energy efficiency in the low-SNR regime is also investigated in terms of the power per information bit required for reliable communication. The required minimum power is shown to be achieved at a positive rate for the SD receiver with no CSI, whereas it is achieved in the zero-rate limit for the case of perfect CSI available at the receiver. Moreover, numerical simulations imply that the presented large-system analysis can provide a good approximation for not so large systems. The results in this paper imply that SD schemes can provide a significant performance gain in the low-to-moderate SNR regimes, compared to conventional receivers based on one-shot channel estimation.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2013.2268848","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6595627/06532317.pdf","startPage":"6517","endPage":"6541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2013.2268848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6595627","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On an Achievable Rate of Large Rayleigh Block-Fading MIMO Channels With No CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532317/","displayDocTitle":"On an Achievable Rate of Large Rayleigh Block-Fading MIMO Channels With No CSI","volume":"59","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"13767496","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6532317/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On an Achievable Rate of Large Rayleigh Block-Fading MIMO Channels With No CSI","sourcePdf":"tit-takeuchi-2268848-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.171083S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6595627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6595627","articleId":"6532317","onlineDate":"14 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6532324,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Betti Betti Beneventi","affiliation":["ARCES-University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanni Betti","lastName":"Betti Beneventi","id":"37400734700"},{"name":"Massimo Ferro","affiliation":["Micron Technology, Agrate Brianza, Monza and Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Ferro","id":"37530815000"},{"name":"Alessandro Calderoni","affiliation":["Micron Technology, Agrate Brianza, Monza and Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Calderoni","id":"37396467500"},{"name":"Paolo Fantini","affiliation":["Micron Technology, Agrate Brianza, Monza and Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Fantini","id":"37268164600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6532324","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":295},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","Analytical models","Probability","Programming","Time measurement","Current measurement","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antimony compounds","chalcogenide glasses","electric properties","germanium compounds","phase change materials","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physics based statistical modeling","PCM current drift","negative drift coefficient","amorphous phase change memory","chalcogenide based phase change memory","size 45 nm","Ge2Sb2Te5"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chalcogenides","drift","negative drift coefficients (NDC)","phase-change memory (PCM)","statistical modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532324","abstract":"Current drift over time in amorphous (\u03b1) chalcogenide (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">C</i>\n)-based phase-change memory (PCM) is investigated through statistical electrical characterization of 45-nm-PCMs integrating \u03b1Ge\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nSb\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nTe\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">5</sub>\n.

Conventional spectral classifiers treat hyperspectral images as a list of spectral measurements and do not consider spatial dependences, which leads to a dramatic decrease in classification accuracies. In this paper, a new automatic framework for the classification of hyperspectral images is proposed. The new method is based on combining hidden Markov random field segmentation with support vector machine (SVM) classifier. In order to preserve edges in the final classification map, a gradient step is taken into account. Experiments confirm that the new spectral and spatial classification approach is able to improve results significantly in terms of classification accuracies compared to the standard SVM method and also outperforms other studied methods.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2013.2263282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/6750044/06532336.pdf","startPage":"2565","endPage":"2574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2013.2263282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Images Based on Hidden Markov Random Fields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532336/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Images Based on Hidden Markov Random Fields","volume":"52","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14131288","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6532336/","dateOfInsertion":"28 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Images Based on Hidden Markov Random Fields","sourcePdf":"tgrs-benediktsson-2263282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08895S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6750044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6750044","articleId":"6532336","onlineDate":"14 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6532343,"authors":[{"name":"Minghua Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Minghua Chen (SM'12) received his B.Eng. and M.S. degrees from the Department of EE at Tsinghua University in 1999 and 2001, respectively.

A large number of such problems, however, cannot readily be tackled by distributed algorithms. The Markov approximation framework studied in this paper is a general technique for synthesizing distributed algorithms. We show that when using the log-sum-exp function to approximate the optimal value of any combinatorial problem, we end up with a solution that can be interpreted as the stationary probability distribution of a class of time-reversible Markov chains. Selected Markov chains among this class yield distributed algorithms that solve the log-sum-exp approximated combinatorial network optimization problem. By examining three applications, we illustrate that the Markov approximation technique not only provides fresh perspectives to existing distributed solutions, but also provides clues leading to the construction of new distributed algorithms in various domains with provable performance. We believe the Markov approximation techniques will find applications in many other network optimization problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532343/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2013","volume":"59","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13767499","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6532343/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Markov Approximation for Combinatorial Network Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Markov Approximation for Combinatorial Network Optimization","sourcePdf":"tit-chen-2268923-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.259474S","chronDate":"Oct.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6595627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"6595627","articleId":"6532343","onlineDate":"14 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6532346,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Saleh Tavazoei","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6594825/6532346/6532346-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Saleh Tavazoei (M'09) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2003, 2005, and 2008, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.

Coarse spatial resolution remotely sensed images have wide swath and high temporal resolution. However, the mixed pixel problem lowers the mapping accuracy and hampers the application of these images. The development of remote sensing technology has enabled the storage of a great amount of medium spatial resolution images that recorded the historical conditions of the earth. The combination of timely updated coarse spatial resolution images and previous medium spatial resolution images is a promising technique for mapping forests in large areas with instant updating at low expense. Super-resolution mapping (SRM) is a method for mapping land cover classes with a finer spatial resolution than the input coarse resolution image. This method can reduce the mixed pixel problem of coarse spatial resolution images to a certain extent. In this paper, a novel spatial-temporal SRM based on a Markov random field, called STMRF_SRM, is proposed using a current coarse spatial resolution Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer image and a previous medium spatial resolution Landsat Thematic Mapper image as input. The proposed model encourages the spatial smoothing of land cover classes for spatially neighboring subpixels and keeps temporal links between temporally neighboring subpixels in bitemporal images. Results show that the proposed STMRF_SRM model can generate forest maps with higher overall accuracy and kappa value.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2264828","startPage":"29","endPage":"39","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2264828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6689357","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/6689357/06532370.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Super-Resolution Mapping of Forests With Bitemporal Different Spatial Resolution Images Based on the Spatial-Temporal Markov Random Field","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532370/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Super-Resolution Mapping of Forests With Bitemporal Different Spatial Resolution Images Based on the Spatial-Temporal Markov Random Field","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6532370/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13990262","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Super-Resolution Mapping of Forests With Bitemporal Different Spatial Resolution Images Based on the Spatial-Temporal Markov Random Field","sourcePdf":"jstars-li-2264828-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084177S","chronDate":"Jan.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6689357","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6689357","articleId":"6532370","onlineDate":"14 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6532372,"authors":[{"name":"Ashraf Ahmed","affiliation":["Soongsil University, Dongjak-gu, Seoul, KR"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/6582562/6532372/6532372-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ashraf Ahmed (M\u201909) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt, in 1999, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in the field of renewable energy control and power electronics from the University of Durham, Durham, UK, in 2011.","He is currently an Assistant Professor at Soongsil University, Seoul, Korea, and a Research Fellow at the Desert Research Center, Cairo.

The two control modes, MPPT and RPM, are inherently compatible and can be readily implemented, without the need of a dumping load for the RPM. Following the establishment of a dynamic system model, the study develops the guidelines to determine the variables of a direct hill-climbing method for MPPT: the perturbation time intervals and the magnitudes of the applied perturbations. These results are then used to optimally set up a variable-step size incremental conductance (VSIC) algorithm along with adaptive RPM control. The power tracking performance and power limiting capability are verified by simulation and experiment.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2013.2266343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel7/60/6582562/06532372.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6582562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2013.2266343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Fast PV Power Tracking Control Algorithm With Reduced Power Mode","volume":"28","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6532372/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13706558","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532372/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast PV Power Tracking Control Algorithm With Reduced Power Mode","sourcePdf":"tec-park-2266343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079314S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"6582562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"6582562","articleId":"6532372","onlineDate":"14 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-19"},{"_id":6532395,"authors":[{"name":"Stefania Perri","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Computer Sciences and Systems of the University of Calabria, Rende, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefania","lastName":"Perri","id":"37283398500"},{"name":"Pasquale Corsonello","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Computer Sciences and Systems of the University of Calabria, Rende, Italy"],"firstName":"Pasquale","lastName":"Corsonello","id":"37283399400"},{"name":"Giuseppe Cocorullo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Computer Sciences and Systems of the University of Calabria, Rende, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Cocorullo","id":"37282897000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"6532395","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2500},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","cellular automata","logic CAD","quantum dots","transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area-delay efficient binary adders","QCA","quantum-dot cellular automata","transistors","single die","chip computational capabilities","logic modules"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adders","nanocomputing","quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA)."]},{"kwd":["Adders","nanocomputing","quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA)"]}],"abstract":"As transistors decrease in size more and more of them can be accommodated in a single die, thus increasing chip computational capabilities.

For a voltage source inverter, the switching loss is reduced by 87%, compared to a conventional sinusoidal pulsewidth modulation (SPWM) method. For a current source inverter, the switching loss is reduced by 60%. In both cases, the power density is increased by a factor of 2 to 3. In addition, it is also verified that the output harmonic distortions of SVPWAM is lower than SPWM, by only using one-third switching frequency of the latter one. A 1-kW boost-converter-inverter prototype has been built and tested using this modulation method. The maximum overall system efficiency of 96.7% has been attained at full power rating. The whole system power density reaches 2.3 kW/L and 0.5 kW/lb. The numbers are remarkable at this power rating. As a result, it is feasible to use SVPWAM to make the buck-boost inverter suitable for applications that require high efficiency, high power density, high temperature, and low cost.

Based on Lyapunov theory and the linear matrix inequality technique, a new stability criterion is proposed to improve calculation accuracy and to reduce computation time, which makes it be suitable for handling with multi-area LFC schemes. The interaction of delay margins between different control areas and the relationship between delay margins and control gains are investigated in details. Moreover, usage of delay margins as a new performance index to guide controller design is discussed, including tuning of the controller for a trade-off between delay tolerance and dynamic response, choosing the upper bound of the fault counter of communication channels and the upper bound of sampling period of a discrete realization of the controller. Case studies are carried out based on two-area traditional, two-area and three-area deregulated LFC schemes, all equipped with PID-type controllers, respectively. Simulation studies are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6627990/06532412.pdf","startPage":"4465","endPage":"4474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2265104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2265104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6627990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532412","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Further Results on Delay-Dependent Stability of Multi-Area Load Frequency Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Stability criteria","Power system stability","Communication channels","Frequency control","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","frequency control","linear matrix inequalities","load regulation","Lyapunov methods","stability","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-dependent stability","multiarea load frequency control","Lyapunov theory","linear matrix inequality technique","stability criterion","delay margins interaction","control gains","controller design","controller tuning","delay tolerance","dynamic response","three-area deregulated LFC schemes","two-area deregulated LFC schemes","PID-type controllers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication delays","delay margin","delay-dependent stability","deregulated environment","multi-area load frequency control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Further Results on Delay-Dependent Stability of Multi-Area Load Frequency Control","volume":"28","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6532412/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"13849539","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Further Results on Delay-Dependent Stability of Multi-Area Load Frequency Control","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-jiang-2265104-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126595S","chronDate":"Nov.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6627990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"6627990","articleId":"6532412","onlineDate":"14 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6532415,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Moreira-Matias","affiliation":["Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, Lisboa, PT"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6587572/6532415/6532415-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luis Moreira-Matias received the M.Sc. degree in informatics engineering from the University of Porto, Porto, Portugal, in 2009, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in machine learning with the Faculty of Engineering.","He is also with the Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support, Tecnologia e Ci\u00eancia, Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores, University of Porto.

The sensors that are installed in each vehicle are providing new opportunities for automatically discovering knowledge, which, in return, delivers information for real-time decision making. Intelligent transportation systems for taxi dispatching and for finding time-saving routes are already exploring these sensing data. This paper introduces a novel methodology for predicting the spatial distribution of taxi-passengers for a short-term time horizon using streaming data. First, the information was aggregated into a histogram time series. Then, three time-series forecasting techniques were combined to originate a prediction. Experimental tests were conducted using the online data that are transmitted by 441 vehicles of a fleet running in the city of Porto, Portugal. The results demonstrated that the proposed framework can provide effective insight into the spatiotemporal distribution of taxi-passenger demand for a 30-min horizon.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/6587572/06532415.pdf","startPage":"1393","endPage":"1402","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2013.2262376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2013.2262376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6587572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting Taxi\u2013Passenger Demand Using Streaming Data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Predictive models","Cities and towns","Time series analysis","Companies","Data models","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","data mining","decision making","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predicting taxi passenger demand","data streaming","taxi companies","knowledge discovery","real-time decision making","intelligent transportation systems","taxi dispatching","time-saving routes","spatial distribution","histogram time series","time-series forecasting techniques","Porto Portugal","spatiotemporal distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)","data streams","ensemble learning","Global Positioning System (GPS) data","mobility intelligence","taxi\u2013passenger demand","time-series forecasting","time-varying Poisson models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Predicting Taxi\u2013Passenger Demand Using Streaming Data","volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6532415/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"13747884","dateOfInsertion":"29 August 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Taxi\u2013Passenger Demand Using Streaming Data","sourcePdf":"tits-moreiramatias-2262376-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099697S","chronDate":"Sept.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6587572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"269","xplore-issue":"6587572","articleId":"6532415","onlineDate":"14 June 2013","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":6532423,"authors":[{"name":"Vidyabhushan Mohan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6532341/6532423/6532423-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vidyabhushan Mohan received the B.E. degree from the College of Engineering, Anna University, Guindy, Chennai, India, in 2006, and the M.S. degree from the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA, in 2010, both in computer science and engineering.

A range of consumer electronics products, such as cell-phones and music players, use flash memory for storage and flash memory is increasingly displacing hard disk drives as the primary storage device in laptops, desktops, and servers.

Exploring this design space requires detailed insights into the power characteristics of flash memory. In this paper, we present FlashPower, a detailed power model for the two most popular variants of NAND flash, namely, the single-level cell (SLC) and 2-bit Multi-Level Cell (MLC) based flash memory chips. FlashPower is built on top of CACTI, a widely used tool in the architecture community for studying various memory organizations. FlashPower takes several parameters like the device technology, microarchitectural layout, bias voltages and workload parameters as input to estimate the power consumption of a flash chip during its various operating modes. We validate FlashPower against chip power measurements from several different manufacturers and show that our results are comparable to the actual chip measurements. We illustrate the versatility of the tool in a design space exploration of power optimal flash memory array configurations.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2013.2249557","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/6532341/06532423.pdf","startPage":"1031","endPage":"1044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2013.2249557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6532341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Power Consumption of NAND Flash Memories Using FlashPower","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Power Consumption of NAND Flash Memories Using FlashPower","volume":"32","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13566134","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6532423/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532423/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Power Consumption of NAND Flash Memories Using FlashPower","sourcePdf":"tcad-mohan-2249557-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115966S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6532341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6532341","articleId":"6532423","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6532424,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Xie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Xie","id":"37955698400"},{"name":"Yanzhi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yanzhi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37966617700"},{"name":"Younghyun Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Younghyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406976600"},{"name":"Massoud Pedram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Massoud","lastName":"Pedram","id":"37278158100"},{"name":"Naehyuck Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Naehyuck","lastName":"Chang","id":"37278041200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4151"}],"articleNumber":"6532424","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1453},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","url":"http://www.c-eda.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532424","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Resource management","Supercapacitors","Arrays","Voltage control","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy management systems","energy storage","power grids","solar cell arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["charge allocation","hybrid electrical energy storage systems","HEES system","heterogeneous electrical energy storage","power source","load devices","retrieval functions","charge storage","electricity costs reduction","power grid","off-peak times","undependable power supply","power fluctuation","charge management policies","global charge allocation problem","maximum charge allocation efficiency","mixed integer nonlinear program","power conversion losses","energy conservation law","self-discharge effects","daily charge allocation schedule","photovoltaic array","solar radiation level","photovoltaic cell array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Charge allocation","charge management","energy efficiency","energy storage system (ESS)","hybrid energy storage system (HESS)"]}],"abstract":"A hybrid electrical energy storage (HEES) system consists of multiple banks of heterogeneous electrical energy storage (EES) elements placed between a power source and some load devices and providing charge storage and retrieval functions. For an HEES system to perform its desired functions of 1) reducing electricity costs by storing electricity obtained from the power grid at off-peak times when its price is lower, for use at peak times instead of electricity that must be bought then at higher prices, and 2) alleviating problems, such as excessive power fluctuation and undependable power supply, which are associated with the use of large amounts of renewable energy on the grid, appropriate charge management policies must be developed in order to efficiently store and retrieve electrical energy while attaining performance metrics that are close to the respective best values across the constituent EES banks in the HEES system. This paper is the first to formally describe the global charge allocation problem in HEES systems, namely, distributing a specified level of incoming power to a subset of destination EES banks so that maximum charge allocation efficiency is achieved. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program with the objective function set to the global charge allocation efficiency and the constraints capturing key requirements and features of the system such as the energy conservation law, power conversion losses in the chargers, the rate capacity, and self-discharge effects in the EES elements. A rigorous algorithm is provided to obtain near-optimal charge allocation efficiency under a daily charge allocation schedule.

It systematically combines temperature aware task assignment, task migration, and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling. PROMETHEUS is based on our novel low overhead temperature prediction technique, Tempo. In contrast to previous work, Tempo allows accurate estimation of potential thermal effects of future scheduling decisions without requiring any runtime adaptation. It reduces the maximum prediction error by up to an order of magnitude. Using Tempo, PROMETHEUS framework provides two temperature aware scheduling techniques that proactively avoid power states leading to future thermal emergencies while matching the performance needs to the workload requirements. The first technique, TempoMP, integrates Tempo with an online multiparametric optimization method to guide decisions on task assignment, migration, and setting core power states in a temperature aware fashion. Our second scheduling technique, TemPrompt uses Tempo in a heuristic algorithm that provides comparable efficiency at lower overhead. On average, these two techniques reduce the lateness of the tasks by 2.5\u00d7 and energy-lateness product (ELP) by 5\u00d7 compared to the previous work.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2013.2247656","startPage":"1110","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/6532341/06532438.pdf","endPage":"1123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6532341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2013.2247656","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532438/","displayDocTitle":"PROMETHEUS: A Proactive Method for Thermal Management of Heterogeneous MPSoCs","volume":"32","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6532438/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13566138","publicationDate":"July 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PROMETHEUS: A Proactive Method for Thermal Management of Heterogeneous MPSoCs","sourcePdf":"tcad-sharifi-2247656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086131S","chronDate":"July  2013","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6532341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6532341","articleId":"6532438","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6532474,"authors":[{"name":"Huai Wang","affiliation":["Electronic engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Huai Wang (hwa@et.aau.dk) earned his Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from City University of Hong Kong in 2012.

The very recent discussions about the performance of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries in the Boeing 787 have confirmed so far that, while battery technology is growing very quickly, developing cells with higher power and energy densities, it is equally important to improve the performance of the battery management system (BMS) to make the battery a safe, reliable, and cost-efficient solution. The specific characteristics and needs of the smart grid and EVs, such as deep charge/discharge protection and accurate state-of-charge (SOC) and state-of-health (SOH) estimation, intensify the need for a more efficient BMS. The BMS should contain accurate algorithms to measure and estimate the functional status of the battery and, at the same time, be equipped with state-of-the-art mechanisms to protect the battery from hazardous and inefficient operating conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6532486/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6532486/","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13566126","volume":"7","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Battery Management System: An Overview of Its Application in the Smart Grid and Electric Vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Battery Management System: An Overview of Its Application in the Smart Grid and Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"07mie02-rahimieichi-2250351-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095224S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"44","isNumber":"6532468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4154573","citationCount":"457","xplore-issue":"26296","articleId":"6532486","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6532498,"authors":[{"name":"Go Yazawa","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Go","lastName":"Yazawa","id":"37590348200"},{"name":"Naohiko Yuki","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Naohiko","lastName":"Yuki","id":"37720440300"},{"name":"Jun Terada","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Terada","id":"37269416400"},{"name":"Shunji Kimura","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shunji","lastName":"Kimura","id":"37280805000"},{"name":"Naoto Yoshimoto","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoto","lastName":"Yoshimoto","id":"38313460600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-55752-962-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0457-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6532498","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Optical network units","Accuracy","Frequency synchronization","Mobile communication","Wavelength division multiplexing","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","synchronisation","time division multiplexing","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronized \u03bb-tunable WDM/TDM-PON","timestamps","frequency synchronization method","time synchronization","mobile backhaul networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6532498","abstract":"We propose a time and frequency synchronized \u03bb-tunable WDM/TDM-PON with a synchronization method using timestamps.

This set is referred to as the search or correlation space. Genetic algorithms can be used to optimize both the location accuracy and the time required to produce a position fix, reducing the size of the search space. This paper proposes an innovation in such application of genetic algorithms, restricting the first generation population to the predicted best server area of the serving sector measured by the mobile station. In field tests in a GSM cellular network in a dense urban environment, this approach achieved reductions of 20% and 15% in the 50-th and 90-th percentile location errors, respectively, in comparison to the original formulation, where the initial population is randomly distributed throughout the whole service area. An average reduction of 91% in the time to produce a position fix was also observed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533269/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13581757","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6533269/","publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","conferenceDate":"20-21 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm optimized DCM positioning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm optimized DCM positioning","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"s1wf1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089748S","chronDate":"20-21 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523364","isNumber":"6533249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523364","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6533249","articleId":"6533269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6533283,"authors":[{"name":"Rebecca Adam","affiliation":["Information and Coding Theory Lab, Faculty of Engineering, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Rebecca","lastName":"Adam","id":"37705512800"},{"name":"Peter Adam Hoeher","affiliation":["Information and Coding Theory Lab, Faculty of Engineering, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter Adam","lastName":"Hoeher","id":"37273574400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6033-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6031-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6032-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6533283","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Training","Delay estimation","Vectors","Frequency-domain analysis","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","signal detection","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semi-blind channel estimation","joint communication-and-positioning","JCAP","unified signal architecture","data detection","positioning relevant information estimation","time-of-arrival","TOA","communication data estimation","virtual training"]}],"abstract":"In this contribution, semi-blind channel estimation for joint communication and positioning (JCAP) is proposed. The concept is based on a unified signal architecture. Within this framework channel estimation is the core part, since it links communication and positioning algorithms. Thus, channel estimation serves twofold purposes: Firstly, it is inherently required for data detection and secondly it is employed to estimate positioning relevant information like the time of arrival (TOA). JCAP aims at exploiting synergetic effects. Employing semi-blind channel estimation is beneficial in this context, since it allows to assimilate the estimated communication data as virtual training.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2013.6533283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6533249","publicationTitle":"2013 10th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication (WPNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 10th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication (WPNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523364/6533249/06533283.pdf","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-blind channel estimation for joint communication and positioning","doi":"10.1109/WPNC.2013.6533283","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 March 2013","displayDocTitle":"Semi-blind channel estimation for joint communication and positioning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533283/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","accessionNumber":"13581771","publicationDate":"March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6533283/","conferenceDate":"20-21 March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-blind channel estimation for joint communication and positioning","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"s4ra1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091553S","chronDate":"20-21 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523364","isNumber":"6533249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523364","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6533249","articleId":"6533283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6533287,"authors":[{"name":"Emanuel Staudinger","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Communications and Navigation, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Emanuel","lastName":"Staudinger","id":"37705969900"},{"name":"Armin Dammann","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Institute of Communications and Navigation, Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Dammann","id":"37269758600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6033-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6031-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6032-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6533287","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Distance measurement","Tin","Synchronization","Correlation","Peak to average power ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood estimation","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse subcarrier allocation","timing-based ranging","OFDM modulated signals","outdoor environments","accurate range estimation","narrowband block-type synchronization symbols","scattered pilot structure","synchronization symbols","timing estimation performance","concurrent multiuser access","deterministic subcarrier allocation method","OFDM-based ranging","concurrent multiuser ranging","Cram\u03adr-Rao lower-bound","CRLB","maximum-likelihood estimator","ML estimator","sparse subcarrier allocation","signal to noise ratios","adaptive solution","adapted estimator again"]}],"abstract":"Accurate range estimation is a fundamental and crucial part of any position estimation technique. State-of-the-art systems exploiting OFDM modulated signals use narrowband block-type synchronization symbols or a scattered pilot structure. These synchronization symbols are mainly designed to allow communication only. Their timing estimation performance is not sufficient for ranging and especially for any concurrent multi-user access for advanced ranging schemes. In this paper, we propose a new, deterministic subcarrier allocation method for OFDM-based ranging in outdoor environments. The resulting symbol can be exploited for concurrent multi-user ranging, e.g., for cooperative positioning of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We study theoretical performances with a Cramer-Rao lower-bound (CRLB) and the true performance with a Maximum-Likelihood (ML) estimator. The correlation function for the ML estimator changes with the sparse subcarrier allocation. This leads to peak ambiguities and therefore to a significant divergence between the ML estimator performance and the CRLB at higher sparsity levels and low signal to noise ratios. We propose a simple adaptive solution to resolve ambiguities and show that we can reach the CRLB with our adapted estimator again.","doi":"10.1109/WPNC.2013.6533287","publicationTitle":"2013 10th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication (WPNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 10th Workshop on Positioning, Navigation and Communication (WPNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523364/6533249/06533287.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WPNC.2013.6533287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6533249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse subcarrier allocation for timing-based ranging with OFDM modulated signals in outdoor environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533287","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533287/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse subcarrier allocation for timing-based ranging with OFDM modulated signals in outdoor environments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13581775","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6533287/","conferenceDate":"20-21 March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse subcarrier allocation for timing-based ranging with OFDM modulated signals in outdoor environments","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"s4ra5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092723S","chronDate":"20-21 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523364","isNumber":"6533249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523364","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6533249","articleId":"6533287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6533309,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjia Liu","affiliation":["Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wenjia Liu","id":"38515660300"},{"name":"Shengqian Han","affiliation":["Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shengqian Han","id":"37404245200"},{"name":"Chenyang Yang","affiliation":["Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Chenyang Yang","id":"37279099600"},{"name":"Chengjun Sun","affiliation":["Beijing Samsung Telecom R&D Center, China"],"lastName":"Chengjun Sun","id":"37675267800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0110-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0109-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0108-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6533309","dbTime":"67 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3338},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Power demand","Signal to noise ratio","Antennas","Interference","Computer architecture","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","cellular radio","energy conservation","energy consumption","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO","small cell network","energy efficiency","wireless communication system","spectral efficiency","SE","multi-input multi-output network","EE","high throughput cellular network","SCN","low-power base stations","BS","propagation loss reduce","BS sleep","multicell network","antenna density","average cell-edge signal-to-noise-ratio","SNR","circuit power consumption"]}],"abstract":"Energy efficiency (EE) is becoming an important design goal for wireless communication systems providing high spectral efficiency (SE). Both massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) and small cell network (SCN) are expected to achieve high EE for high throughput cellular networks, though using different mechanisms. Massive MIMO improves EE by exploiting a large array gain, while SCN improves EE by deploying a large number of low-power base stations (BSs) to reduce the propagation loss and increase the opportunity of BS sleep. In this paper, we compare the EEs as well as the SEs of Massive MIMO and SCN. For a fair comparison, we consider a multi-cell network with the same user density, antenna density and average cell-edge signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Perfect channel information is assumed, and three BS sleep strategies are considered. Our analysis shows that the EE of SCN increases with the cell size shrinking, and the achievable SEs of SCN and Massive MIMO increase with the cell-edge SNR. When the number of cells is large, SCN is always more energy efficient than Massive MIMO. On the other hand, when the number of cells is small, Massive MIMO achieves higher EE than SCN when the circuit power consumptions of Massive MIMO are much lower than SCN.","doi":"10.1109/WCNCW.2013.6533309","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526844/6533299/06533309.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNCW.2013.6533309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6533299","startPage":"24","endPage":"29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive MIMO or small cell network: Who is more energy efficient?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO or small cell network: Who is more energy efficient?","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533309/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 April 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13581358","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6533309/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MIMO or small cell network: Who is more energy efficient?","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p24liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087995S","chronDate":"7-10 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526844","isNumber":"6533299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526844","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6533299","articleId":"6533309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6533315,"authors":[{"name":"Wenfeng Ma","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Wenfeng Ma","id":"37400400400"},{"name":"Hui Tian","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Hui Tian","id":"37999400300"},{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["Shanghai National Engineering Research Center, Digital Television Company Limited, China"],"lastName":"Yang Zhang","id":"37061761500"},{"name":"Youyun Xu","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Youyun Xu","id":"37277724400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0110-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0109-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0108-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6533315","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533315","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Broadcasting","Iterative decoding","Conferences","Simulation","TV"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","parity check codes","radio broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["green terrestrial broadcasting system","rate compatible Raptor-like LDPC codes","low density parity check","partially decoding scheme"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a partially decoding scheme, combined with the rate compatible Raptor-like low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, is proposed to provide more robust, power saving solutions for the future terrestrial broadcasting systems.

By means of exact expression of bit error rate (BER), the suboptimal switching thresholds (ST) of fading gain subject to a target BER constraint are derived. It is shown that this suboptimal ST are very close to the optimal ST, and is more accurate than the conventional ST based on approximate BER expression. By the ST, we obtain exact closed-form expressions of the spectrum efficiency (SE) and average BER. Moreover, a tightly approximate BER is derived to simplify the calculation of exact BER, which has more accuracy than the existing approximate BER. Simulation results for SE and BER are in good agreement with the derived theoretical expressions. The results show that the multiuser MIMO with adaptive modulation can provide better SE than the single user counterpart, and the system SE using suboptimal ST is also higher than that using conventional ST.","doi":"10.1109/WCNCW.2013.6533322","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526844/6533299/06533322.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNCW.2013.6533322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6533299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of rate-adaptive modulation with antenna selection in multiuser MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533322/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of rate-adaptive modulation with antenna selection in multiuser MIMO system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13581371","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6533322/","conferenceDate":"7-10 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of rate-adaptive modulation with antenna selection in multiuser MIMO system","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p89yin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08115S","chronDate":"7-10 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526844","isNumber":"6533299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526844","xplore-issue":"6533299","articleId":"6533322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6533323,"authors":[{"name":"Xia Pan","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xia Pan","id":"37061880500"},{"name":"Xiao-fan Lu","affiliation":["New Media Center, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xiao-fan Lu","id":"37061819700"},{"name":"Ming-qi Li","affiliation":["New Media Center, Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Ming-qi Li","id":"37291657900"},{"name":"Rong-fang Song","affiliation":["School of Telecommunication and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Rong-fang Song","id":"38627121800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0110-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0109-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0108-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6533323","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533323","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Throughput","Instruction sets","Iterative decoding","Signal processing algorithms","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","mobile radio","multimedia communication","parity check codes","radio broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high throughput LDPC decoder","CMMB","virtual radio","high throughput low density parity check decoder","telecommunication systems","real-time LDPC decoder","China mobile multimedia broadcasting","x86 processors","SIMD instructions","single instruction multiple data instructions","normalized min sum decoding algorithm","check nodes","variable nodes","memory access operations","Intel Core i7-3960X","multithread processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Virtual Radio","CMMB","LDPC","SIMD","fixed-point","Multithreading"]}],"abstract":"LDPC (Low Density Parity Check) is widely used in many telecommunication systems due to its excellent performance.

We also discuss some of the potential performance gains for WiFi Direct communications in the presence of 3GPP LTE network-level management. Our extensive simulation study of LTE traffic offloading onto WiFi Direct covers a range of D2D loads and interference levels. We focus on the case where the D2D overlay network is assisted by the cellular infrastructure network; or more specifically, where the cellular network supplies its clients with service discovery

denoise-and-forward network coding (DNF-NC) scheme is proposed for multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) two-way relaying channels. Specifically the relay jointly detects the M-quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) messages from two sources, and remaps the network coded detections into the same modulation mode. Furthermore, the precoding design for DNF-NC is studied to minimize the total mean square error (MSE). To ensure the relay denoising performance, two necessary conditions are presented first, and then the general optimal precoding matrices can be obtained by solving two convex problems independently. Moreover, a channel diagonalization scheme with power allocation is introduced, and the closed-form solution for high SNR region is also derived. Compared with the optimized amplify-and-forward network coding (AF-NC) scheme, DNF-NC has much lower computational complexity, and the simulation results show that it can achieve better BER performance than AF-NC in high SNR region.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding design for denoise-and-forward network coding in MIMO two-way relay systems","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)","doi":"10.1109/WCNCW.2013.6533329","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Workshops (WCNCW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526844/6533299/06533329.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCNCW.2013.6533329","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6533299","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533329","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533329/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Precoding design for denoise-and-forward network coding in MIMO two-way relay systems","conferenceDate":"7-10 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6533329/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13581378","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding design for denoise-and-forward network coding in MIMO two-way relay systems","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"p141zhao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064572S","chronDate":"7-10 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526844","isNumber":"6533299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526844","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6533299","articleId":"6533329","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6533333,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulaziz Mohamad","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Abdulaziz","lastName":"Mohamad","id":"37061769500"},{"name":"Rapha\u00ebl Visoz","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Rapha\u00ebl","lastName":"Visoz","id":"37268925600"},{"name":"Antoine O.

This paper proposes an Electric drive for Hybrid vehicles application and its control strategy to achieve a wide speed range. In these vehicles, important requirements for the electric drive are low weight, small volume, high efficiency and low cost. When choosing the motor for the vehicle drive, the induction motor is an obvious alternative but a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) can offer advantages in terms of higher efficiency and specific power. In this paper a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) is used as an electric drive machine. The operation of a PMSM above the base speed is possible by weakening the permanent-magnet excitation by a demagnetizing field component supplied by the stator winding. This can be done by closed loop operation of PMSM. The speed and torque control of the PMSM drive used as hybrid vehicle is controlled by proper tuning the PI controllers. A three level diode clamped inverter using IGBT's has simulated, whose switching sequences are controlled by Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM). A mathematical model of PMSM drive suitable for hybrid vehicle has simulated and proper closed loop control is established by field oriented control method. The entire work is done in MATLAB/SIMULINK.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Hybrid electric vehicles","Inverters","Permanent magnet motors","Electric motors","Ice"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","demagnetisation","hybrid electric vehicles","insulated gate bipolar transistors","machine vector control","optimal control","permanent magnet motors","PI control","PWM invertors","stators","synchronous motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop PI control","hybrid electric vehicle","three level diode clamped inverter","optimal efficiency","vehicle drive","induction motor","permanent magnet synchronous motor","electric drive machine","permanent-magnet excitation","demagnetizing field component","stator winding","PMSM drive","IGBT","switching sequences","space vector pulse width modulation","SVPWM","field oriented control method","MATLAB-SIMULINK"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hybrid Electric Vehicles","Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM)","PI controller","Field Oriented Control(FOC)","Three level diode clamped inverter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICEETS.2013.6533479","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Energy Efficient Technologies for Sustainability","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Energy Efficient Technologies for Sustainability","pdfPath":"/iel7/6525155/6533346/06533479.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6533346","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEETS.2013.6533479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed loop PI control of PMSM for hybrid electric vehicle using three level diode clamped inverter for optimal efficiency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Closed loop PI control of PMSM for hybrid electric vehicle using three level diode clamped inverter for optimal efficiency","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533479/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6533479/","accessionNumber":"13582660","conferenceDate":"10-12 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 April 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed loop PI control of PMSM for hybrid electric vehicle using three level diode clamped inverter for optimal efficiency","confLoc":"Nagercoil, India","sourcePdf":"133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054753S","chronDate":"10-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6525155","isNumber":"6533346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6525155","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6533346","articleId":"6533479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6533480,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Due to the collection of recycled leakage energies collected in a clamp capacitor, it is then recycled to separate load by the clamp boost converter to achieve high efficiency. In addition to this, it avoids mitigation of the output diode's reverse recovery problem and also achieves reduction of voltage stress thereby interleaving the converters.

It is one of the complex problems of the power system. The aim of the dynamic economic load dispatch problem is to find the optimal combination of generators in order to minimize the operating costs of the system. The load demand must be appropriately shared among the various generating units of the system. This work is done by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. PSO is applied to search for the optimal schedule of all the generator units that can supply the required load demand at minimum fuel cost while satisfying all system constraints such as Generator constraints, Ramp rate limits, Transmission losses and valve point effect. The PSO method was developed through the simulation of a simplified social system. The simulations were performed over various test systems with 5 generation units. So by using PSO we have done the dynamic economic load dispatch thereby reducing the operating costs of the system.","doi":"10.1109/ICEETS.2013.6533570","startPage":"1273","endPage":"1278","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Energy Efficient Technologies for Sustainability","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEETS.2013.6533570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6533346","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Energy Efficient Technologies for Sustainability","pdfPath":"/iel7/6525155/6533346/06533570.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of particle swarm optimization for dynamic economic load dispatch problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533570/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Implementation of particle swarm optimization for dynamic economic load dispatch problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6533570/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13582749","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","conferenceDate":"10-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 April 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of particle swarm optimization for dynamic economic load dispatch problem","confLoc":"Nagercoil, India","sourcePdf":"224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059434S","chronDate":"10-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6525155","isNumber":"6533346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6525155","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6533346","articleId":"6533570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6533581,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Combined Economic Emission Dispatch (CEED) is a way to compute the optimal generation of the power system by minimizing the fuel cost and emission levels simultaneously. The CEED is a multi objective problem and in general solved considering the operational limits on generators and transmission losses as constraints. But, in the present work the ramp rate limits and prohibiting operating zones of the generator are also considered as constraints. Literature reveals that Particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is a powerful technique for solving optimization problems. This paper proposes a new approach of PSO method named as `Gaussian PSO method' that considers a Gaussian density function to eliminate the drawback of general PSO method and to obtain a global optimal solution. The Gaussian PSO method is applied on two test systems for solving the CEED problem. The results obtained are compared to those obtained by general PSO method to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in obtaining global optimal solution.","doi":"10.1109/ICEETS.2013.6533581","startPage":"1336","endPage":"1340","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Energy Efficient Technologies for Sustainability","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEETS.2013.6533581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6533346","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Energy Efficient Technologies for Sustainability","pdfPath":"/iel7/6525155/6533346/06533581.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian Particle swarm optimization for combined economic emission dispatch","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533581/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Gaussian Particle swarm optimization for combined economic emission dispatch","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6533581/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13582760","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","conferenceDate":"10-12 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 April 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian Particle swarm optimization for combined economic emission dispatch","confLoc":"Nagercoil, India","sourcePdf":"235.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061188S","chronDate":"10-12 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6525155","isNumber":"6533346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6525155","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6533346","articleId":"6533581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6533601,"authors":[{"name":"Nadia Haddadou","affiliation":["Gaspard Monge Computer Science Laboratory (LIGM-UMR 8049), Universit\u00e9 Paris, Champs sur Marne, France"],"firstName":"Nadia","lastName":"Haddadou","id":"38340726800"},{"name":"Abderrezak Rachedi","affiliation":["Gaspard Monge Computer Science Laboratory (LIGM-UMR 8049), Universit\u00e9 Paris, Champs sur Marne, France"],"firstName":"Abderrezak","lastName":"Rachedi","id":"37550525400"},{"name":"Yacine Ghamri-Doudane","affiliation":["ENSIIE, Evry, France"],"firstName":"Yacine","lastName":"Ghamri-Doudane","id":"38270773200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6044-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6043-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6042-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6533601","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":330},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533601","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Receivers","Equations","Mathematical model","Vehicular ad hoc networks","Estimation","Economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incentive schemes","road safety","telecommunication security","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicular ad hoc networks","VANET","economic incentive model based approach","exclusion","trust","road safety applications","advanced driver assistance systems","information sharing safety","malicious nodes","selfish nodes","data reception ratio","VIME","signaling theory","credit count"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VANET","trust model","incentive model","exclusion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ComComAp.2013.6533601","endPage":"18","startPage":"13","publicationTitle":"2013 Computing, Communications and IT Applications Conference (ComComAp)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Computing, Communications and IT Applications Conference (ComComAp)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523354/6533591/06533601.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ComComAp.2013.6533601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6533591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trust and exclusion in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks: An economic incentive model based approach","abstract":"In this body of work, we are interested in road safety applications such as advanced driver assistance systems, based on Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs). One of the particular characteristics of this kind of networks is the continuous sharing of safety information by its nodes. Since this kind of information is time sensitive, a node cannot spend much time to verify its validity with an authority. However, the presence of malicious and selfish nodes in VANETs corrupts exchanged data, and lowers the overall data reception ratio in the network. To tackle this, we propose a new incentive model with exclusion for malicious nodes called VIME. VIME is inspired from the signaling theory from economics. It is based on managing a credit count that each node receives at the initialization of the application. Straightforwardly, VIME is based on two pillars. On the one hand, a node pays an appropriate cost for each sent message, which is seen by the receivers as a guarantee from the source about the truthfulness of the information. On the other hand, nodes get rewarded for cooperating in the network. The proposed economic model allows computing the amounts to be paid and those to be awarded in order to fight selfish and malicious nodes. We validate our approach via simulations. We show that VIME is able to detect and evict gradually all malicious nodes in the network, and decreases the ratio of corrupted and false sent data until reaching zero. Moreover, it has a positive impact on the participation of selfish nodes, as our approach increases the average ratio of sent data as to equal the ideal case's percentage, when no selfish node is present.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533601/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6533601/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13581407","conferenceDate":"1-4 April 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Trust and exclusion in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks: An economic incentive model based approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trust and exclusion in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks: An economic incentive model based approach","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"0309079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100572S","chronDate":"1-4 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523354","isNumber":"6533591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523354","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6533591","articleId":"6533601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6533616,"authors":[{"name":"Maw-Yang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Ilan University, Yilan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Maw-Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37534371700"},{"name":"Yi-Kai Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Ilan University, Yilan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Kai","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37061755900"},{"name":"Chien-Hsien Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Ilan University, Yilan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chien-Hsien","lastName":"Chiang","id":"38238615700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6044-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6043-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6042-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6533616","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533616","abstract":"In this paper, 2-D T/W OCDMA system using LDPC code is investigated.

This paper presents a novel PAPR reduction method for amplitude phase shift keying (APSK) modulation. The amplitude of the transmit signal in time domain is firstly limited and afterwards the corresponding constellation points in frequency domain are dynamically extended to mitigate the distortion caused by the amplitude clipping.

Finally, we apply the H.264 source coding via our platform for demonstrations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Computing, Communications and IT Applications Conference (ComComAp)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6523354/6533591/06533629.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"168","publicationTitle":"2013 Computing, Communications and IT Applications Conference (ComComAp)","doi":"10.1109/ComComAp.2013.6533629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ComComAp.2013.6533629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6533591","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concatenated coded OFDM system over AWGN channel with H.264 source coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","OFDM","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Telecommunication standards","Iterative decoding","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","BCH codes","concatenated codes","digital video broadcasting","error correction codes","forward error correction","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","source coding","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated coded OFDM system","AWGN channel","H.264 source coding","robust concatenated coding scheme","64 QAM","concatenated coding scheme","BCH code","outer code","LDPC code","inner code","code rates","BCH codes","concatenated coding scheme","ETSI EN 302 775","terrestrial wireless digital video broadcasting systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC code","BCH code","64 QAM","H.264"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533629/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"Concatenated coded OFDM system over AWGN channel with H.264 source coding","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6533629/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13581433","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","conferenceDate":"1-4 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concatenated coded OFDM system over AWGN channel with H.264 source coding","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"3104505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078315S","chronDate":"1-4 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6523354","isNumber":"6533591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6523354","xplore-issue":"6533591","articleId":"6533629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6533633,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Lu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Lu","id":"38240439400"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278432600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6044-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6043-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6042-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6533633","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":872},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel capacity","MIMO","Resource management","Transmitters","Wireless communication","Approximation methods","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel capacity","MIMO communication","radio transmitters","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["water-filling capacity analysis","large MIMO system","water-filling power allocation scheme","flat Rayleigh fading channel capacity","channel randomness","channel information","transmitter","eigenchannel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","capacity analysis","water-filling"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study a water-filling power allocation scheme in large M \u00d7 N MIMO systems over flat Rayleigh fading channels.

Since some reactants like costly reagents and infant's blood are valuable, their usage should be minimized during dilution. In this paper, we propose an optimal reactant minimization algorithm, GORMA, for sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips. GORMA adopts a systematic method to exhaustively check all possible dilution solutions and then identifies the one with minimal reactant usage and waste through maximal droplet sharing. Experimental results show that GORMA outperforms all the existing methods in reactant usage. Meanwhile, the waste amount is reduced up to 30% as compared with existing waste minimization methods. Moreover, GORMA requires only 0.6% more operations on average when compared with an operation-minimal dilution method.","doi":"10.1109/VLDI-DAT.2013.6533817","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium onVLSI Design, Automation, and Test (VLSI-DAT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium onVLSI Design, Automation, and Test (VLSI-DAT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526674/6533796/06533817.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLDI-DAT.2013.6533817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6533796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph-based optimal reactant minimization for sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533817/","displayDocTitle":"Graph-based optimal reactant minimization for sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13581181","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6533817/","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph-based optimal reactant minimization for sample preparation on digital microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"12DR33TW0831S.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055488S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526674","isNumber":"6533796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526674","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6533796","articleId":"6533817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6533831,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37859114000"},{"name":"Chun Huat Heng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chun Huat","lastName":"Heng","id":"37273015300"},{"name":"Yong Lian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Lian","id":"37270094200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4436-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4435-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6533831","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":358},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Transceivers","Energy efficiency","Detectors","Radio transmitters","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","body sensor networks","clocks","CMOS integrated circuits","delay lock loops","digital radio","low-power electronics","prosthetics","pulse generators","radio transceivers","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital impulse radio UWB transceiver for wireless body sensor networks","low power wearable biomedical devices","implantable biomedical devices","UWB transmitter","carrier-less pulse generator","on-off keying","OOK","modulation","Barker code","autothreshold detection","power efficiency","timing window","delay locked loop","CMOS technology","energy efficiency","clock retiming circuit","frequency 0 MHz to 960 MHz","word length 11 bit","size 0.35 mum"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a mostly digital impulse radio (IR) UWB transceiver for low power wearable and implantable biomedical devices.

Small input capacitance of the ADC is necessary to achieve high signal bandwidth with low power consumption of the input buffer. The design challenge is a reduction of power consumption of the interpolated Flash ADC and the input buffer simultaneously. To solve this, the interpolation technique using reference voltages is proposed to reduce the input capacitance and interpolated stages simultaneously.

Since EEG signals are very feeble, they are easy to be contaminated by artifacts. Among all artifacts, eye blink artifact dose the most significant harm to EEG signals. For acquiring artifact free EEG signals, ICA is a popular method for artifacts extraction. After extraction of ICA, eye blink artifacts are rejected to improve the reliability of EEG applications such as brain computer interfaces (BCIs). To promote the feasibility and convenience of BCIs, a real-time ICA algorithm, ORICA, is adopted in this system. With ORICA, the system immediately finishes each ICA result after each sample time. After each ICA result is generated, the automatic eye blink artifact rejection and inverse ICA are performed to acquire eye blink artifact free EEG signals in realtime. For system portability and high integration, a front-end interface of commercial IC, ADS1298 provided by TI, and Bluetooth interface, UART, are implemented. The system is designed used TSMC 90nm CMOS technology with 8 channels EEG processing in 128 Hz sample rate of raw data and consumes 8.56 mW at 50 MHz clock rate. The design methods of the proposed EEG system are provided in this paper. The performance and processing results of the system are also shown to reach 0.2532 s latency after each EEG sample time.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An online recursive ICA based real-time multichannel EEG system on chip design with automatic eye blink artifact rejection","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium onVLSI Design, Automation, and Test (VLSI-DAT)","doi":"10.1109/VLDI-DAT.2013.6533850","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium onVLSI Design, Automation, and Test (VLSI-DAT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526674/6533796/06533850.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLDI-DAT.2013.6533850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6533796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533850","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2013","displayDocTitle":"An online recursive ICA based real-time multichannel EEG system on chip design with automatic eye blink artifact rejection","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6533850/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13581214","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An online recursive ICA based real-time multichannel EEG system on chip design with automatic eye blink artifact rejection","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"21DR114TW0851S.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061449S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526674","isNumber":"6533796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526674","xplore-issue":"6533796","articleId":"6533850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6533853,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Sheng Hou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Sheng","lastName":"Hou","id":"37401416100"},{"name":"Jin-Fu Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhong li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jin-Fu","lastName":"Li","id":"37279861800"},{"name":"Chih-Yen Lo","affiliation":["Information and Communication Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Yen","lastName":"Lo","id":"37061542800"},{"name":"Ding-Ming Kwai","affiliation":["Information and Communication Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ding-Ming","lastName":"Kwai","id":"37294410600"},{"name":"Yung-Fa Chou","affiliation":["Information and Communication Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Fa","lastName":"Chou","id":"37265084400"},{"name":"Cheng-Wen Wu","affiliation":["Information and Communication Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Wen","lastName":"Wu","id":"37276423200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4436-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4435-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6533853","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Temperature distribution","Circuit faults","Temperature measurement","Leakage currents","Current measurement","Built-in self-test"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","field programmable gate arrays","logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based test platform","DRAM data retention time distribution analysis","dynamic random access memory","Micron DRAM","field programmable gate arrays"]}],"abstract":"Data retention time distribution of a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) has a heavy impact on its yield, power, and performance.

Using the Image segmentation algorithm the major issue Deforestation is evaluated by comparing the image taken from the year 1939 and 2000. Deforestation is a serious issue that most nations face today. Deforestation is primarily due to the urbanization. Most nations that are presently under the scanner for deforestation had immense forest stretch. The application of remote sensing is at present a significant method for forest monitoring, particularly in vast and remote areas. Different methods have been presented by the researchers for finding forest types and change detection in urbanization. In this study, we propose polygon segmentation and 2D haar wavelet for adaptive regional forest change detection. First in order to detect the forest types, 2D haar wavelet is applied to image at different threshold level and identifies the type of forest. The polygon segmentation is applied to low dense forest and segregate forest with non forest region. Finally compare the result with data sets and find decreasing the forest cover. The proposed technique is in real time, given the exigencies of forest urbanization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Change detection in deforestation using high resolution satellite image with Haar wavelet transforms","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Green High Performance Computing (ICGHPC)","doi":"10.1109/ICGHPC.2013.6533910","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Green High Performance Computing (ICGHPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6526527/6533892/06533910.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICGHPC.2013.6533910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6533892","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533910","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 March 2013","displayDocTitle":"Change detection in deforestation using high resolution satellite image with Haar wavelet transforms","conferenceDate":"14-15 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6533910/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"13582779","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Change detection in deforestation using high resolution satellite image with Haar wavelet transforms","confLoc":"Nagercoil, India","sourcePdf":"9103image.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063086S","chronDate":"14-15 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526527","isNumber":"6533892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526527","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6533892","articleId":"6533910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6533913,"authors":[{"name":"Tomesh Verma","affiliation":["Communication Engg., Department of E&Tc Engg, CSIT Durg, Durg, Chhattisgarh, India"],"firstName":"Tomesh","lastName":"Verma","id":"37061934900"},{"name":"Raj Kumar Sahu","affiliation":["Department of E&Tc Engg, CSIT Durg, Durg, Chhattisgarh, India"],"firstName":"Raj Kumar","lastName":"Sahu","id":"38257085300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2594-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2592-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2593-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6533913","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1004},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Training","Principal component analysis","Face recognition","Covariance matrices","Vectors","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image classification","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PCA-LDA-based face recognition system","principal component analysis-based dimension reduction technique","linear discriminant analysis-based dimension reduction technique","training database set dimension reduction","feature extraction","class separability","nearest mean classification techniques","recognition rate","image preprocessing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face Recognition","PCA","LDA","City Block Distance","Recognition Rate"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6533913","abstract":"Face recognition has a major impact in security measures which makes it one of the most appealing areas to explore.

In this paper, face recognition is performed using Principal Component Analysis followed by Linear Discriminant Analysis based dimension reduction techniques.

Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) and Orthogonal Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) are the two major techniques used in LTE. The main drawback of OFDMA over SC-FDMA is its high peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Hence OFDMA is used in the downlink of the fourth generation (4G) wireless communication systems for its high spectral efficiency and high PAPR. SC-FDMA is used in the uplink of the fourth generation (4G) wireless communication systems since it is more power efficient. The main objective of this paper is to design optimum physical layer architecture of a high data rate LTE uplink transceiver using SC-FDMA multiple access scheme with error correction mechanism using Low dense parity check codes (LDPC) to provide lesser Bit Error Rate (BER) and avoiding packet loss by Interleaving. The optimum physical layer architecture for the fourth generation (4G) wireless communication systems is chosen by comparing the LDPC coded SC-FDMA with the LDPC coded OFDMA. The chosen architecture must be more power efficient and support high data rates, which is the main prerequisite for the mobile user.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-15 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6533926/","accessionNumber":"13582795","displayDocTitle":"Design of optimum physical layer architecture for a high data rate LTE uplink transceiver","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of optimum physical layer architecture for a high data rate LTE uplink transceiver","confLoc":"Nagercoil, India","sourcePdf":"9306vlsi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0559S","chronDate":"14-15 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6526527","isNumber":"6533892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6526527","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6533892","articleId":"6533926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6533943,"authors":[{"name":"Mingbo Niu","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Mingbo","lastName":"Niu","id":"37409272100"},{"name":"Julian Cheng","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37277386100"},{"name":"Jonathan F.

Error rate performance is studied for communications with binary phase-shift keying, differential phase-shift keying, and noncoherent frequency-shift keying over weak-to-strong (gamma-gamma distributed) turbulence conditions. Series-form error rate expressions are also derived for diversity reception schemes, including maximum ratio combining, equal gain combining, and selection combining. Based on our analysis, it is found that coherent OWC systems typically outperform subcarrier intensity modulation systems, with 24-30 dB improvements in sensitivity, mainly due to their elimination of thermal and background noise effects. The performance improvements of coherent systems are confirmed through numerical studies. The findings can offer significant benefits for future OWC systems that are subject to transmitted power limitations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533943/","volume":"5","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6533943/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13566142","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Error rate performance comparison of coherent and subcarrier intensity modulated optical wireless communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error rate performance comparison of coherent and subcarrier intensity modulated optical wireless communications","sourcePdf":"554.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129118S","chronDate":"June  2013","xplore-pub-id":"4563700","isNumber":"6533938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563700","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6533938","articleId":"6533943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6533944,"authors":[{"name":"Nicola Calabretta","affiliation":["Department of Electro-Optical Communications, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"bio":{"p":["Nicola Calabretta (M'01) received a Ph.D. degree from Eindhoven University of Technology (TUE) in 2004.

The WDM channels suffer from interchannel crosstalk, while the FSO communication performance in a clear atmosphere is limited by atmospherically induced scintillation. These impairments, plus the amplified spontaneous emission noise from optical amplification, combine in a potentially problematic way, particularly in the upstream direction, which is investigated here.

Induction motors are very common in many sectors of the industry and assume an important role in the national energy policy. The nowadays methodologies, which are used in diagnosis, condition monitoring and dimensioning of these motors, are based on measure of the speed variable. However, the direct measure of this variable compromises the system control and starting circuit of an electric machinery, reducing its robustness and increasing the implementation costs. Simulation results and experimental data are presented to validate the proposed approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6533966/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2013","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"13578523","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Speed estimation for induction motor using neural networks method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speed estimation for induction motor using neural networks method","sourcePdf":"11TLA2_13Goedtel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032402S","chronDate":"March  2013","isNumber":"6533953","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9907","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6533966","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6536714,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas O.

Vision opens a new realm of computer applications. Weather analysis from cloud maps and medical diagnosis from x-rays and blood cell counts are two of many high volume data processing tasks that require pictorial input. Man-machine communication will be facilitated if a person can directly show the computer a real object, rather than describe it symbolically. Designers, for example, could then easily obtain a computerized structural analysis of scale models.","doi":"10.1109/MC.1973.6536714","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel7/2/6536704/06536714.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"24","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MC.1973.6536714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6536704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer vision","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6536714/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1973","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1973","displayDocTitle":"Computer vision","volume":"6","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1973","dateOfInsertion":"24 June 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer vision","sourcePdf":"019024.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.01562S","chronDate":"May  1973","isNumber":"6536704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"4","articleId":"6536714","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1973","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"}]
