Extended grouping of RFID tags allows identifying missing objects without the requirement for accessing external systems. The original scheme relies on Gallager's parity-check matrices and, as such, it cannot easily achieve designated decoding guarantees due to its pseudo-random nature. In view of the Gallager's parity-check matrix form of incidence matrices of RTDs, this letter proposes extended grouping of RFID tags based on RTDs. The proposed scheme proves to provide designated decoding guarantees more easily than the original scheme. In addition, this letter introduces a simple method, termed group splitting (GS), to improve the performance of extended grouping of RFID tags. Theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme with or without GS is an efficient approach for the design of extended grouping of RFID tags.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2014.2306264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6732989/06740004.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2014.2306264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6732989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extended Grouping of RFID Tags Based on Resolvable Transversal Designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740004/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Extended Grouping of RFID Tags Based on Resolvable Transversal Designs","volume":"21","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14126522","htmlLink":"/document/6740004/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extended Grouping of RFID Tags Based on Resolvable Transversal Designs","sourcePdf":"lsp-su-2306264-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070888S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6732989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6732989","articleId":"6740004","onlineDate":"13 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6740006,"authors":[{"name":"Yici Cai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Yici Cai (M'04\u2013SM'10) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering and the M.S. degree in computer science and technology from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 1983, 1986, and 2007, respectively.","She is currently a Professor with the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing.

This paper presents a novel obstacle-avoiding CTS approach with slew constraints satisfied and signal polarity corrected. We build a look-up table through NGSPICE simulation to achieve accurate buffer delay and slew, which guarantees that the final skew after NGSPICE simulation is as satisfactory as expected. Aiming at skew optimization under constraints of slew and obstacles, our CTS approach features the clock tree construction stage with the obstacle-aware topology generation algorithm called OBB, balanced insertion of candidate buffer positions and a fast heuristic buffer insertion algorithm. With an overall view on obstacles to explore the global optimization space, our CTS approach effectively overcomes the negative influence on skew brought by the obstacles. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our CTS approach with significantly improved skew and latency by 69.0% and 72.0% on average. In addition, the accuracy of the look-up table is demonstrated through the huge skew reduction by 87.3% on average. Moreover, our OBB heuristic algorithm obtains 53.2% improvement in skew than the classic balanced bipartition algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2300174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7014337/06740006.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2300174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7014337","startPage":"142","endPage":"155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Obstacle-Avoiding and Slew-Constrained Clock Tree Synthesis With Efficient Buffer Insertion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Obstacle-Avoiding and Slew-Constrained Clock Tree Synthesis With Efficient Buffer Insertion","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740006/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14869966","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6740006/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61274031"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Obstacle-Avoiding and Slew-Constrained Clock Tree Synthesis With Efficient Buffer Insertion","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-deng-2300174-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154009S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7014337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7014337","articleId":"6740006","onlineDate":"13 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6740007,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Yao","affiliation":["Tsinghua University, Institute of Microelectronics, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6740003/6740007/6740007-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian Yao (S'12) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2010.

Existing yield analysis methods still encounter issues related to multiple failure regions resulting from high-dimensional process parameter space and/or multiple performance specifications. This paper proposes a new method that combines the advantages of existing importance sampling and boundary searching methods, and avoids issues in both. The key idea is to first find all likely failure regions and then, do importance sampling on these regions. Surrogate models are used to further accelerate the method so that SPICE-simulations can be highly reduced. Experimental results show that the proposed method is suitable for handling problems with multiple failure regions. Meanwhile, it can provide 5X ~ 20X speed-up over other existing techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2013.2292504","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and

The four-multiplier normalized lattice, with signal power at all delay elements normalized to unity, has particular advantage in its overflow property. However, when used to implement an Nth-order digital filter, the normalized lattice implementation requires 5N+1 multipliers. There exists another lattice structure with excellent FWL property called the injected numerator lattice structure. In this paper, we combine the injected numerator lattice and tapped numerator lattice to form a new hybrid lattice structure, which is not only canonic in the number of multipliers resulting in a significant reduction in overall implementation cost but also exhibits much better FWL properties than the normalized lattice structure. An improved \u201cpeakedness\u201d measure is also introduced for application where the input signal has a strong time varying sinusoidal component. The new structure requires a few additional adders; it can be used to implement any causal and stable z-transform transfer function.

Previously a tool flow, called the TLUT tool flow, was developed to aid the designer in applying dynamic circuit specialization (DCS) for their designs. The TLUT tool flow generates an implementation in which the lookup tables (LUTs) can be specialized during runtime. In this paper, place and route algorithms are described for the TCON tool flow. The TCON tool flow generates implementations in which not only the logic infrastructure (LUTs) is dynamically specialized, but also the routing infrastructure of the FPGA. Exploiting the reconfigurability of the FPGA interconnection network further improves area (50% to 92% less LUTs and 36% to 81% less wiring), logic depth (a 63% to 80% reduction) and power consumption. To achieve this, major changes were needed, not only in the mapping, but also in the place and route steps. This work describes the altered place and route algorithms, called TPlace and Troute.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2013.2291659","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/6740003/06740026.pdf","startPage":"370","endPage":"383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2013.2291659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740003","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TPaR: Place and Route Tools for the Dynamic Reconfiguration of the FPGA's Interconnect Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740026/","displayDocTitle":"TPaR: Place and Route Tools for the Dynamic Reconfiguration of the FPGA's Interconnect Network","volume":"33","issue":"3","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6740026/","publicationDate":"March 2014","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14126879","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TPaR: Place and Route Tools for the Dynamic Reconfiguration of the FPGA's Interconnect Network","sourcePdf":"tcad-vansteenkiste-2291659-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069667S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6740003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6740003","articleId":"6740026","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6740029,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel T.

In particular, we show that a virtual topology, which constrains the allowable locations of assay operations such as mixing, dilution, sensing, etc., in lieu of traditional placement, can significantly speed up the synthesis process without significantly lengthening assay execution time. We present a base virtual topology and show how it can be leveraged to reduce algorithmic runtimes and guarantee rout ability. We later present several variations of the virtual topology and present experimental results demonstrating best-design practices. We present two binding solutions. The first is a left-edge binding algorithm, while the second is a more intelligent path-based binding algorithm that leverages spatial and temporal locality to produce superior results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740029/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6740029/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14111622","volume":"33","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast Online Synthesis of Digital Microfluidic Biochips","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Online Synthesis of Digital Microfluidic Biochips","sourcePdf":"tcad-grissom-2290582-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103205S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6740003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6740003","articleId":"6740029","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6740030,"authors":[{"name":"Kotb Jabeur","affiliation":["SPINTEC, Grenoble Cedex 9, France"],"firstName":"Kotb","lastName":"Jabeur","id":"37542471800"},{"name":"Gregory Di Pendina","affiliation":["SPINTEC, Grenoble Cedex 9, France"],"firstName":"Gregory Di","lastName":"Pendina","id":"37871373200"},{"name":"Guillaume Prenat","affiliation":["SPINTEC, Grenoble Cedex 9, France"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Prenat","id":"37662680500"},{"name":"Liliana Daniela Buda-Prejbeanu","affiliation":["SPINTEC, Grenoble Cedex 9, France"],"firstName":"Liliana Daniela","lastName":"Buda-Prejbeanu","id":"38271283500"},{"name":"Bernard Dieny","affiliation":["SPINTEC, Grenoble Cedex 9, France"],"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Dieny","id":"37266522100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6740030","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1538},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compact Modeling of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction Based on Spin Orbit Torque","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740030","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Magnetization","Switches","Mathematical model","Writing","Integrated circuit modeling","Current density"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","magnetic tunnelling","MRAM devices","spin-orbit interactions","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS-compatibility","memories","integrated circuit","spin orbit torque","hybrid MTJ-CMOS technology","spin-transfer torque","three-terminal magnetic tunnel junctions","SOT-MTJ device","Cadence Virtuoso platform","Verilog-A language","Spectre simulator","MRAM"]},{"kwd":["Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)","modeling","MRAM","spin orbit torque (SOT)","spintronics","Verilog-A"]}],"abstract":"High endurance, high speed, scalability, low voltage, and CMOS-compatibility are the ideal attributes of memories that any integrated circuit designer dreams about. Adding non-volatility to all these features makes the magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) an ultimate candidate to efficiently build a hybrid MTJ/CMOS technology. Two-terminal MTJs based on spin-transfer torque (STT) switching have been intensively investigated in literature with a variety of model proposals. Despite the attractive potential of the STT devices, the issue of the common writing/reading path decreases their reliability dramatically. A three-terminal MTJ based on the spin-orbit torque (SOT) approach represents a pioneering way to triumph over current two-terminal MTJs by separating the reading and the writing paths. In this paper, we introduce the first compact model, which describes the SOT-MTJ device based on recently fabricated samples. The model has been developed in Verilog-A language, implemented on Cadence Virtuoso platform and validated with Spectre simulator. For optimized simulation accuracy, many experimental parameters are included in this model. Simulations prove the capability of the model to be efficiently used to design hybrid MTJ/CMOS circuits. Innovative logic circuits based on the SOT-MTJ device, modeled in this paper, are already in progress.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2014.2305695","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6851227/06740030.pdf","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6851227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2014.2305695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740030/","displayDocTitle":"Compact Modeling of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction Based on Spin Orbit Torque","volume":"50","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"09 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6740030/","isJournal":true,"externalId":"4100208","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14429893","publicationDate":"July 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compact Modeling of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction Based on Spin Orbit Torque","sourcePdf":"tmag-jabeur-2305695-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120467S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6851227","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6851227","articleId":"6740030","onlineDate":"13 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6740031,"authors":[{"name":"Edoardo Patti","affiliation":["Department of Control and Computer Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Edoardo","lastName":"Patti","id":"38233188300"},{"name":"Andrea Acquaviva","affiliation":["Department of Control and Computer Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Acquaviva","id":"37273088400"},{"name":"Marco Jahn","affiliation":["Department of User Centered Computing, Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT, Sankt Augustin, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Jahn","id":"37543034500"},{"name":"Ferry Pramudianto","affiliation":["Department of User Centered Computing, Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT, Sankt Augustin, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Ferry","lastName":"Pramudianto","id":"38349147300"},{"name":"Riccardo Tomasi","affiliation":["Istituto Superiore Mario Boella, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Tomasi","id":"37604566300"},{"name":"Damien Rabourdin","affiliation":["Centre Thermique de Lyon, INSA-Lyon, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Damien","lastName":"Rabourdin","id":"37085844038"},{"name":"Joseph Virgone","affiliation":["Centre Thermique de Lyon, INSA-Lyon, Universit\u00e9 Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Virgone","id":"37085573755"},{"name":"Enrico Macii","affiliation":["Department of Control and Computer Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Authors' photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Macii","id":"37267985100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-8184"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-9234"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7816"}],"articleNumber":"6740031","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":636},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems Council","url":"http://www.ieeesystemscouncil.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, the design of an event-driven user-centric middleware for monitoring and managing energy consumption in public buildings and spaces is presented.

In this paper, we establish a framework for estimation of continuous-valued parameters based on compressive measurements on a signal corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). While standard compressed sensing based on naive discretization has been shown to suffer from performance loss due to basis mismatch, we demonstrate that this is not an inherent property of compressive measurements. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (a) We identify the isometries required to preserve fundamental estimation-theoretic quantities such as the Ziv-Zakai bound (ZZB) and the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB). Under such isometries, compressive projections can be interpreted simply as a reduction in \u201ceffective SNR.\u201d (b) We show that the threshold behavior of the ZZB provides a criterion for determining the minimum number of measurements for \u201caccurate\u201d parameter estimation. (c) We provide detailed computations of the number of measurements needed for the isometries in (a) to hold for the problem of frequency estimation in a mixture of sinusoids. We show via simulations that the design criterion in (b) is accurate for estimating the frequency of a single sinusoid.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive Parameter Estimation in AWGN","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2306180","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6774528/06740033.pdf","startPage":"2012","endPage":"2027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2306180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774528","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740033/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2014","displayDocTitle":"Compressive Parameter Estimation in AWGN","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6740033/","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2014","publicationDate":"April15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14180788","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive Parameter Estimation in AWGN","sourcePdf":"tsp-ramasamy-2306180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141389S","chronDate":"April15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6774528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6774528","articleId":"6740033","onlineDate":"13 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6740045,"authors":[{"name":"Gwo Giun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6759763/6740045/6740045-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gwo Giun Lee (S'91\u2013M'97\u2013SM'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, and both the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, MA, USA.","He has held several technical and managerial positions in the industry including System Architect for former Philips Semiconductors, USA, DSP Architect in Micrel Semiconductors, USA, and Director of Quanta Research Institute, Taiwan, before joining the faculty team of the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University (NCKU), Tainan, Taiwan, where he established the Media SoC Laboratory.

Due to concurrent exploration in both algorithm and architecture domains, the designed system requires fewer computations and lowers hardware cost, but is capable of enhancing the accuracy of motion vectors (MVs) by allowing MV refinement from coarse-grained to fine-grained. In addition, a method that uses multiple block candidates tracked by bi-directional MVs for interpolation is also presented to improve visual quality. Benefiting from AAC, we can extract architectural information at algorithmic design phase to determine the most feasible architecture; then, the proposed algorithm can be mapped onto target platform smoothly. The proposed FRUC system, which is capable of converting the frame rate from 60 fps up to 120 fps at full HD (1920 \u00d7 1080) resolution, was successfully implemented and verified on a field-programmable gate array. This FRUC system's performance has not only been shown to surpass state-of-art alternatives in algorithmic performance, but its hardware cost is less than the comparable works described in the literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bi-Directional Trajectory Tracking With Variable Block-Size Motion Estimation for Frame Rate Up-Convertor","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2014.2298923","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/6759763/06740045.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2014.2298923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759763","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740045/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Bi-Directional Trajectory Tracking With Variable Block-Size Motion Estimation for Frame Rate Up-Convertor","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6740045/","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14145721","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bi-Directional Trajectory Tracking With Variable Block-Size Motion Estimation for Frame Rate Up-Convertor","sourcePdf":"jetcas-lee-2298923-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138312S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6759763","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6759763","articleId":"6740045","onlineDate":"13 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6740049,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Shi","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Cyber Physical Society Credible Service Computing, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6740003/6740049/6740049-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Shi received the B.S. degrees in computer science from the Xi'an University of Post and Telecommunication, Xi'an, Shanxi, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2013.","He is currently a full-time Teacher with the College of Computer Science, Chongqing University, Chongging, China.

The operation of the proposed converter is studied and analyzed. In order to control the proposed converter, a space-vector modulation (SVM) strategy with redundant switching states has been proposed. SVM usually has redundant switching state anyways.

The accumulative crosstalk noise in large scale ONoCs diminishes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), causes severe performance degradation, and constrains the network scalability. For the first time, this paper systematically analyzes and models the worst-case crosstalk noise and SNR in folded-torus-based ONoCs. Formal analytical models for the worst-case crosstalk noise and SNR are presented. The crosstalk noise analysis is hierarchically performed at the basic photonic device level, then at the optical router level, and finally at the network level. We consider a general 5 \u00d7 5 optical router model to enable crosstalk noise and SNR analyses in folded-torus-based ONoCs using an arbitrary 5 \u00d7 5 optical router. Using the general optical router model, the worst-case SNR link candidates, which restrict the network scalability, are found. Also, we present a novel crosstalk noise and loss analysis platform, called CLAP, which can analyze the crosstalk noise and SNR of arbitrary ONoCs. Case studies of optimized crossbar and Crux optical routers using recent photonic device parameters are presented. Moreover, we compare the worst-case crosstalk noise and SNR in folded-torus-based and mesh-based ONoCs using optimized crossbar and Crux optical routers. The quantitative simulation results show the critical behavior of crosstalk noise in large scale ONoCs. For example, in folded-torus-based ONoCs using the Crux optical router, the noise power exceeds the signal power for network sizes larger than 12 \u00d7 12; when the network size is 20 \u00d7 20 and the injection signal power equals 0 dBm, the signal power and noise power are -9.4 dBm and -6.1 dBm, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2013.2288676","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/6740003/06740052.pdf","startPage":"437","endPage":"450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2013.2288676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic Analysis of Crosstalk Noise in Folded-Torus-Based Optical Networks-on-Chip","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740052/","displayDocTitle":"Systematic Analysis of Crosstalk Noise in Folded-Torus-Based Optical Networks-on-Chip","volume":"33","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14111616","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6740052/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic Analysis of Crosstalk Noise in Folded-Torus-Based Optical Networks-on-Chip","sourcePdf":"tcad-nikdast-2288676-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070454S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6740003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6740003","articleId":"6740052","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6740058,"authors":[{"name":"Jiang-Fan Liu","affiliation":["Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jiang-Fan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598331900"},{"name":"Yu-Rong Pu","affiliation":["Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yu-Rong","lastName":"Pu","id":"37649118800"},{"name":"Jin-Sheng Zhang","affiliation":["High-Tech Institute, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jin-Sheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38067949700"},{"name":"Xiao-Li Xi","affiliation":["Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Li","lastName":"Xi","id":"37605455600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6740058","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":423},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Mathematical model","Perfectly matched layers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bilinear systems","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perfectly matched layer","complex-frequency-shifted constitutive parameters","alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time-domain method","ADI-FDTD","cylindrical grids","bilinear transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD)","complex frequency shifted","cylindrical coordinates","perfectly matched layer (PML)"]}],"abstract":"A perfectly matched layer (PML) with complex-frequency-shifted (CFS) constitutive parameters is introduced to the alternating-direction-implicit finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD) method in cylindrical grids.

Nevertheless, there is very little research focusing on the layout decomposition for TPL. Recent work proposed the first systematic study on the layout decomposition for TPL. However, the proposed algorithm extending a stitch-finding method used in DPL may miss legal stitch locations and generate conflicts that can be resolved by inserting stitches for TPL. In this paper, we point out two main differences between DPL and TPL layout decompositions. Based on the two differences, we propose a novel TPL layout decomposition algorithm. We first present two new graph reduction techniques to reduce the problem size without degrading overall solution quality. We then propose a stitch-aware mask assignment algorithm, based on a heuristic that finds a mask assignment such that the conflicts among the features in the same mask are more likely to be resolved by inserting stitches. Finally, stitches are inserted to resolve as many conflicts as possible. Experimental results show that the proposed layout decomposition algorithm can achieve around 56% reduction of conflicts and more than 40X speed-up, as compared to the previous work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740060/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14111617","htmlLink":"/document/6740060/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Layout Decomposition Algorithm for Triple Patterning Lithography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Layout Decomposition Algorithm for Triple Patterning Lithography","sourcePdf":"tcad-chang-2288678-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060321S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6740003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6740003","articleId":"6740060","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6740067,"authors":[{"name":"In\u00e8s Meganem","affiliation":["IRAP, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, UPS-OMP, Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6757015/6740067/6740067-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["In\u00e8s Meganem received the Engineering degree in electronics and signal processing from ENSEEIHT, Toulouse, France, and the M.Sc. degree in signal processing from the National Polytechnical Institute of Toulouse, both in 2009 and, in December 2012, the Ph.D. degree in signal and image processing from the University of Toulouse.

The linear-quadratic model is less studied in the literature than the linear one. In this paper, we propose original methods that are based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). This class of methods is well suited to many applications where the data are non-negative. We are here particularly interested in spectral unmixing (extracting reflectance spectra of materials present in pixels and associated abundance fractions) for urban hyperspectral images. The originality of our work is that we developed extensions of NMF, which is initially suited to the linear model, for the linear-quadratic model. The proposed algorithms are tested with simulated hyperspectral images using real reflectance spectra and the obtained results are very satisfactory.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6757015/06740067.pdf","startPage":"1822","endPage":"1833","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2306181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2306181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6757015","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear-Quadratic Blind Source Separation Using NMF to Unmix Urban Hyperspectral Images","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Materials","Signal processing algorithms","Hyperspectral imaging","Blind source separation","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","geophysical image processing","hyperspectral imaging","matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["separation linear-quadratic blind source separation","NMF","unmix urban hyperspectral image simulation","BSS","linear-quadratic mixing model","nonnegative matrix factorization","spectral material unmixing","material reflectance spectra extraction","associated abundance fraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind source separation (BSS)","linear-quadratic mixing model","non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)","hyperspectral images","spectral unmixing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740067/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Linear-Quadratic Blind Source Separation Using NMF to Unmix Urban Hyperspectral Images","volume":"62","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6740067/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14155860","dateOfInsertion":"11 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear-Quadratic Blind Source Separation Using NMF to Unmix Urban Hyperspectral Images","sourcePdf":"tsp-meganem-2306181-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098795S","chronDate":"April1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6757015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6757015","articleId":"6740067","onlineDate":"13 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6740072,"authors":[{"name":"Seung-Chul Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6756988/6740072/6740072-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seung-Chul Lee (S'08\u2013M'13) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Sogang University, Seoul, Korea, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA, in 2012.","From 2000 to 2007, he was with the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), a nonprofit government-funded research organization in Korea, where he studied analog circuits for wireless communication systems and high-speed high-resolution data converters for the next-generation HDTV as a Senior Engineer.

Traditional grid-connected PV inverter control configurations are basically current sourced and cannot easily control ac voltage or frequency. The PV inverter using the Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTS) concepts can control ac voltage and frequency but have a major problem with load transients. During a load transient, the PV microsource becomes overloaded with the possibility of collapsing the dc bus voltage resulting in an ac voltage drop. This paper presents a PV inverter control strategy which enables PV to behave as a voltage source and is capable of maintaining dc bus voltage stability during load transient. With this PV inverter control configuration, it is shown that the PV microsource can operate as a voltage source in the CERTS microgrid.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/6861487/06740077.pdf","startPage":"1726","endPage":"1734","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2302313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2302313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6861487","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage-Source Control of PV Inverter in a CERTS Microgrid","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Microgrids","Inverters","Transient analysis","Oscillators","Frequency control","Power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-AC power convertors","distributed power generation","frequency control","power system reliability","power system transient stability","renewable energy sources","solar cells","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voltage-source control","PV inverter","CERTS microgrid","photovoltaic sources","renewable sources","grid-connected PV inverter control configurations","ac voltage drop","ac frequency","consortium for electric reliability technology solution concepts","load transients","PV microsource","dc bus voltage stability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTS)","controller","intentional islanding","microgrid","photovoltaic (PV)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Voltage-Source Control of PV Inverter in a CERTS Microgrid","volume":"29","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6740077/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14469313","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage-Source Control of PV Inverter in a CERTS Microgrid","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-du-2302313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080247S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6861487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"6861487","articleId":"6740077","onlineDate":"13 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6740090,"authors":[{"name":"Florian D\u00f6rfler","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6879345/6740090/6740090-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Florian D\u00f6rfler (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913) received the Diplom degree in engineering cybernetics from the University of Stuttgart, Germany, in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2013.","He is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of California Los Angeles, and he is affiliated with the Center for Nonlinear Studies at the Los Alamos National Laboratories.

Recent research efforts have been aimed at developing wide-area control strategies that involve communication of remote signals. In conventional wide-area control, the control structure is fixed a priori typically based on modal criteria. In contrast, here we employ the recently-introduced paradigm of sparsity-promoting optimal control to simultaneously identify the optimal control structure and optimize the closed-loop performance. To induce a sparse control architecture, we regularize the standard quadratic performance index with an l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-penalty on the feedback matrix. The quadratic objective functions are inspired by the classic slow coherency theory and are aimed at imitating homogeneous networks without inter-area oscillations. We use the New England power grid model to demonstrate that the proposed combination of the sparsity-promoting control design with the slow coherency objectives performs almost as well as the optimal centralized control while only making use of a single wide-area communication link. In addition to this nominal performance, we also demonstrate that our control strategy yields favorable robustness margins and that it can be used to identify a sparse control architecture for control design via alternative means.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2304465","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6879345/06740090.pdf","startPage":"2281","endPage":"2291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2304465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6879345","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsity-Promoting Optimal Wide-Area Control of Power Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity-Promoting Optimal Wide-Area Control of Power Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740090/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","volume":"29","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6740090/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14525669","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsity-Promoting Optimal Wide-Area Control of Power Networks","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-dorfler-2304465-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122411S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6879345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"6879345","articleId":"6740090","onlineDate":"13 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":6740091,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Stoopman","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Delft, CD, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6756988/6740091/6740091-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mark Stoopman was born in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, in 1983.

In order to improve the sensitivity, the antenna-rectifier interface is analyzed as it plays a crucial role in the co-design optimization. Subsequently, a 5-stage cross-connected differential rectifier with a 7-bit binary-weighted capacitor bank is designed and fabricated in standard 90 nm CMOS technology. The rectifier is brought at resonance with a high-Q loop antenna by means of a control loop that compensates for any variation at the antenna-rectifier interface and passively boosts the antenna voltage to enhance the sensitivity. A complementary MOS diode is proposed to improve the harvester's ability to store and hold energy over a long period of time during which there is insufficient power for rectification. The chip is ESD protected and integrated on a compact loop antenna. Measurements in an anechoic chamber at 868 MHz demonstrate a -27 dBm sensitivity for 1 V output across a capacitive load and 27 meter range for a 1.78 W RF source in an office corridor.

So the enemy radar position needs to be estimated in advance by the UAV using Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) estimation method. The radar pulses received by UAV are interrogated and delayed signals are sent back which essentially deceive the radar and gives an idea of a phantom trajectory to radar network. However the estimation of TDOA needs to be accurate and fast. Several approaches have been reported in the literature for estimation of TDOA signal. The system dynamics is nonlinear. Linearised time varying Kalman filter and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) are some of the methods which are used for the purpose. However under uncertain and noisy environment, the estimation result is prone to be inaccurate. The variance of estimation error is high. The alternative design is required to take account of the noisy process. The radar position has been estimated by TDOA geolocation technique on utilizing Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and Particle Filter (PF) and the comparative evaluation of unconstrained filters (EKF, UKF, and PF) has been demonstrated on a typical radar network.

Since the technique is computationally complex, designing low cost embedded architectures to meet real-time constraints is a challenge. To meet this challenge, we propose to use a FPGA-DSP integrated platform. SIFT is divided into two major stages: keypoint detection and descriptor generation. The descriptor generation is implemented using an ARM Cortex based DSP. The more computationally intensive stage of keypoint detection is implemented on the FPGA. In this paper, we present novel, efficient, scalable architectures for the keypoint detection step. The architectures are based on parallelizable and pipelined computational flow. The three designs incorporate a Look Up Table based approach, which makes the use of multipliers obsolete in scale space generation stage. The architectures reduce the time taken for keypoint detection by more than 54%, 91% and 88% respectively as compared to existing designs.","doi":"10.1109/CONECCT.2014.6740189","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6729392/6740167/06740189.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONECCT.2014.6740189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Embedded hardware architectures for scale and rotation invariant feature detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740189/","displayDocTitle":"Embedded hardware architectures for scale and rotation invariant feature detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14114933","conferenceDate":"6-7 Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Embedded hardware architectures for scale and rotation invariant feature detection","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569821993.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077504S","chronDate":"6-7 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6729392","isNumber":"6740167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6729392","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6740167","articleId":"6740189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6740193,"authors":[{"name":"Vivin Thomas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Vivin","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37086673869"},{"name":"T.

While a traditional Hadoop cluster deployment assumes a homogeneous cluster, many enterprise clusters are grown incrementally over time, and might have a variety of different servers in the cluster. The nodes' heterogeneity represents an additional challenge for efficient cluster and job management. Due to resource heterogeneity, it is often unclear which resources introduce inefficiency and bottlenecks, and how such a Hadoop cluster should be configured and optimized. In this work1, we explore the efficiency and performance accuracy of the bounds-based performance model for predicting the MapReduce job completion times in heterogeneous Hadoop clusters. We validate the accuracy of the proposed performance model using a diverse set of 13 realistic applications and two different heterogeneous clusters. Since one of the Hadoop clusters is formed by different capacity VM instances in Amazon EC2 environment, we additionally explore and discuss factors that impact the MapReduce job performance in the Cloud.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2013-July 3 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740232/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6740232/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14110328","conferenceDate":"28 June-3 July 2013","publicationDate":"June 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance Modeling of MapReduce Jobs in Heterogeneous Cloud Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Modeling of MapReduce Jobs in Heterogeneous Cloud Environments","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5028a839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066351S","chronDate":"June 28 2013-July 3 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596015","isNumber":"6676660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596015","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6676660","articleId":"6740232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6740239,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Ferry","affiliation":["Department of Networked Systems and Services, SINTEF, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Ferry","id":"37706410300"},{"name":"Alessandro Rossini","affiliation":["Department of Networked Systems and Services, SINTEF, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Rossini","id":"37085529137"},{"name":"Franck Chauvel","affiliation":["Department of Networked Systems and Services, SINTEF, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Franck","lastName":"Chauvel","id":"37671730300"},{"name":"Brice Morin","affiliation":["Department of Networked Systems and Services, SINTEF, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Brice","lastName":"Morin","id":"37311780400"},{"name":"Arnor Solberg","affiliation":["Department of Networked Systems and Services, SINTEF, Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Arnor","lastName":"Solberg","id":"37561884400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5028-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6190"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6182"}],"articleNumber":"6740239","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":106,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":1331},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740239","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptation models","Monitoring","Licenses","Libraries","Cloud computing","Java","Interoperability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","formal specification","open systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven provisioning","model-driven deployment","model-driven monitoring","model-driven adaptation","multicloud systems","cloud computing","cloud solutions","interoperability","vendor lock-in","model-driven engineering techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","provisioning","deployment","monitoring","adaptation","multi-cloud","model-driven engineering","domain-specific modelling language","models@run-time","CloudML"]}],"abstract":"In the landscape of cloud computing, the competition between providers has led to an ever growing number of cloud solutions offered to consumers. The ability to run and manage multi-cloud systems (i.e., applications on multiple clouds) allows exploiting the peculiarities of each cloud solution and hence optimising the performance, availability, and cost of the applications. However, these cloud solutions are typically heterogeneous and the provided features are often incompatible. This diversity hinders the proper exploitation of the full potential of cloud computing, since it prevents interoperability and promotes vendor lock-in, as well as it increases the complexity of development and administration of multi-cloud systems. This problem needs to be addressed promptly. In this paper, we provide a classification of the state-of-the-art of cloud solutions, and argue for the need for model-driven engineering techniques and methods facilitating the specification of provisioning, deployment, monitoring, and adaptation concerns of multi-cloud systems at design-time and their enactment at run-time.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6676660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2013.133","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Sixth International Conference on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6596015/6676660/06740239.pdf","startPage":"887","endPage":"894","doi":"10.1109/CLOUD.2013.133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Model-Driven Provisioning, Deployment, Monitoring, and Adaptation of Multi-cloud Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2013-July 3 2013","displayDocTitle":"Towards Model-Driven Provisioning, Deployment, Monitoring, and Adaptation of Multi-cloud Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-3 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6740239/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2013","accessionNumber":"14110309","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740239/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Model-Driven Provisioning, Deployment, Monitoring, and Adaptation of Multi-cloud Systems","confLoc":"Santa Clara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5028a887.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081624S","chronDate":"June 28 2013-July 3 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6596015","isNumber":"6676660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6596015","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"6676660","articleId":"6740239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-24"},{"_id":6740276,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Baranwal","affiliation":["School of Computer and Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Gaurav","lastName":"Baranwal","id":"37086501459"},{"name":"Deo Prakash Vidyarthi","affiliation":["School of Computer and Systems Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Deo Prakash","lastName":"Vidyarthi","id":"37671325500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2317-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2318-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6740276","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Pricing","Pediatrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","econometrics","regression analysis","resource allocation","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["econometric based model","resource scarcity problem","cloud computing","cloud manager","distributive justice","resource redistribution","probit model","mass storage","cloud storage","service provider","resource request","resource provisioning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud","econometric model","probit model","Cloud storage"]}],"abstract":"Resource provisioning in Cloud computing is an important problem as the resources are scarce. Better utilization of the existing unutilized resources may solve the future resource scarcity problem. To decide, how much percentage of unutilized allocated resources the Cloud manager can take back to solve the problem of scarcity of resource in future, an econometric model of distributive justice is identified and mapped to resource redistribution in Cloud computing. The proposed model uses a Probit model to get the value of coefficient which helps to determine the percentage of unutilized allocated resources to be taken back. Data is increasing at the enormous rate warranting mass storage. Thus, Cloud storage has been considered an important scarce resource. The proposed model focuses on the Cloud storage as a resource. It is assumed that service provider must reserve certain amount of resource to accept sharply increased resource request. The proposed model also identifies this constraint and proposes a model of distributive justice that addresses this. Experimental results reveal the efficacy of the proposed model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An econometric based model for resource scarcity problem in Cloud computing","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)","doi":"10.1109/CONECCT.2014.6740276","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6729392/6740167/06740276.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONECCT.2014.6740276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An econometric based model for resource scarcity problem in Cloud computing","conferenceDate":"6-7 Jan. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14114868","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An econometric based model for resource scarcity problem in Cloud computing","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569822161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057287S","chronDate":"6-7 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6729392","isNumber":"6740167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6729392","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6740167","articleId":"6740276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6740309,"authors":[{"name":"Prabhakar Mishra","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent Systems, PES Institute Of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Prabhakar","lastName":"Mishra","id":"37302793400"},{"name":"Nidhi A","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent Systems, PES Institute Of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"lastName":"Nidhi A","id":"37085573269"},{"name":"J K Kishore","affiliation":["Indian Space Research Organisation, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"J K","lastName":"Kishore","id":"38466755700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2317-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2318-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6740309","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Routing","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","integrated circuit design","network-on-chip","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bio-inspired cobweb topology","cost efficient network on chip","highly scalable network on chip","cobweb structures","torus networks","mesh networks","delay","cobweb topology","3D topology","area constrained designs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Networks on Chip","Routing","Topology"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present the design and analysis of two novel bio-inspired network topologies for use in highly scalable networks.

Focussing on the return link of interactive mobile satellite systems, emphasis has been laid on MinimumMean Squared Error (MMSE) receivers at the gateway to reduce the co-channel interference arising out of aggressive reuse. Performance of such receivers have been evaluated in presence of perfect channel information and synchronization showing impressive gains in throughput. Towards bringing such receivers closer to system implementation, this work aims at understanding the effect of imperfect channel estimates on the resulting performance. In particular, utilizing first order approximations, closed-form expressions for the MMSE receiver and the resulting Mean Squared Error (MSE) have been derived. These expressions provide insight into the effect of channel, noise levels and the estimation error on performance while indicating the robustness of MMSE receiver.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Jan. 2014","conferenceDate":"6-7 Jan. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14114931","displayDocTitle":"Effect of imperfect channel estimate on the performance of MMSE receivers in multibeam satellite systems: First order analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of imperfect channel estimate on the performance of MMSE receivers in multibeam satellite systems: First order analysis","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569825357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083798S","chronDate":"6-7 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6729392","isNumber":"6740167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6729392","xplore-issue":"6740167","articleId":"6740328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6740333,"authors":[{"name":"Binod Prasad","affiliation":["Department of ECE, NIT Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Binod","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37085433822"},{"name":"Sanjay Dhar Roy","affiliation":["Department of ECE, NIT Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Sanjay Dhar","lastName":"Roy","id":"37400812100"},{"name":"Sumit Kundu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, NIT Durgapur, India"],"firstName":"Sumit","lastName":"Kundu","id":"37401883600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2317-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2318-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6740333","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Receivers","Transmitters","Channel estimation","Correlation coefficient","Error probability","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cognitive radio","error statistics","interference suppression","phase shift keying","power control","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SEP","secondary user","imperfect channel estimation","primary user interference","spectrum sharing","cognitive radio network","spectrum efficiency","spectrum band licensing","symbol error probability","outage probability constraint","channel state information","CSI","instantaneous transmit power estimation","power control scheme","scaling factor","primary outage","constellation size effect","transmitted MPSK signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio(CR)","imperfect channel state information","outage capacity","symbol error probability"]}],"abstract":"Spectrum sharing in a cognitive radio network aims to improve the spectrum efficiency where a secondary user (SU) shares the spectrum band licensed to the primary user causing a limited interference to the PU. However, the performance of a SU will be affected by interference from the PU. In this paper we investigate the impact of PU interference on symbol error probability (SEP) and outage probability of SU under constraint of PU outage. The channel state information (CSI) available at SU is used to estimate the instantaneous transmit power of SU under an acceptable outage constraint of PU, while the SU transmits at the maximum power level (P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n) during the absence of PU. A power control scheme based on a scaling factor is proposed for SU so as to maintain a desired outage constraint on PU even in case of imperfect CSI. A closed form expression for outage probability of SU under PU interference is developed. A simulation test bed has been developed in MATLAB to assess the performance of SU in terms of SEP and outage probability with imperfect CSI in presence of PU interference. We also highlight the effects of imperfection in CSI on primary outage. Further the effects of constellation size (M) of the transmitted MPSK signal of SU is indicated on the outage and SEP performance of SU.","doi":"10.1109/CONECCT.2014.6740333","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6729392/6740167/06740333.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONECCT.2014.6740333","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage and SEP of secondary user with imperfect channel estimation and primary user interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740333/","displayDocTitle":"Outage and SEP of secondary user with imperfect channel estimation and primary user interference","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14114907","conferenceDate":"6-7 Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage and SEP of secondary user with imperfect channel estimation and primary user interference","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"1569825553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083151S","chronDate":"6-7 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6729392","isNumber":"6740167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6729392","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6740167","articleId":"6740333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6740355,"authors":[{"name":"Ryno Strauss Verster","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Cape Town, South Africa"],"lastName":"Ryno Strauss Verster","id":"37086729745"},{"name":"Amit Kumar Mishra","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Cape Town, South Africa"],"lastName":"Amit Kumar Mishra","id":"37290432700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2317-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2318-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6740355","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":581},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Bandwidth","Matching pursuit algorithms","Compressed sensing","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","compressed sensing","electronic warfare","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["selective spectrum sensing scheme","EW system","cognitive radio applications","electronic warfare systems","compressive sensing scheme","EW spectrum","modified CS scheme","signal to noise ratio conditions","SNR","signal estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive Sensing","Electronic Warfare","Block Sparsity","spectrum"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective spectrum sensing: A new scheme for efficient spectrum sensing for EW and Cognitive Radio applications","doi":"10.1109/CONECCT.2014.6740355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740167","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication Technologies (CONECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6729392/6740167/06740355.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CONECCT.2014.6740355","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740355","abstract":"One of the major challenges of electronic warfare (EW) systems is to sense a very wide spectrum in real time.

However, the strict limitations in terms of processing power, storage, bandwidth etc. pose a great challenge to data processing in wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN). In this paper we propose an energy saving audio data compression technique for WMSN using partial DCT (PDCT), where only the last DCT coefficient is propagated thereby saves energy by transmitting reduced number of bits. We have considered an application domain where data are co-related and we have also considered a 2D architecture where nodes are randomly placed. Along with the proposed PDCT based scheme a tree based routing scheme is also proposed with an aim to reduce energy consumption further. The design feasibility along with simulation results evaluate efficacy of the scheme in terms of two conflicting parameters viz. energy consumption and SNR. The comparative results confirm our scheme's supremacy over the competing scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Electronics, Computing and Communication

multi-objective optimization problems based on the concept of Pareto optimality. In this paper, we propose a new opposition-based learning fully informed particle swarm optimizer with favour ranking to solve multi-objective optimization problems. Instead of Pareto dominance, favour ranking is used to identify the best individuals in order to guide the search process in the proposed algorithm. Different from other multi-objective PSO, particles in swarm only have position without velocity and the personal best position gets updated using opposition-based learning and favour ranking. Besides, all personal best positions are considered to update particle position. Because of discarding the particle velocity and using full information and favour ranking, the algorithm is the simpler and more effective. The proposed algorithm is applied to some well-known benchmarks. Convergence metric, diversity metric are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the algorithm is effective on the benchmark functions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740391/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14115008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6740391/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective opposition-based learning fully informed particle swarm optimizer with favour ranking","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective opposition-based learning fully informed particle swarm optimizer with favour ranking","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"028G2434195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107862S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6729743","isNumber":"6740363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6729743","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6740363","articleId":"6740391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6740429,"authors":[{"name":"Dakui Wang","affiliation":["International School of Software, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Dakui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086665625"},{"name":"Dongwei Li","affiliation":["International School of Software, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Dongwei","lastName":"Li","id":"37086668069"},{"name":"Yi Lin","affiliation":["International School of Software, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086664724"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1282-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6740429","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Principal component analysis","Face recognition","Training","Feature extraction","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition rate","data field","PCA","principal component analysis","method principle","feature extraction","facial pictures","ORL face database","Olivetti Research Lab face database","training pictures","recognition effect improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PCA Face recognition","Data field"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new method is proposed on face recognition by integrating data field and PCA(Principal Component Analysis).

The result shows PCA has a low recognition rate with few training pictures. Then the faces are redone with the proposed method by integrating PCA and data field. This method just needs a small number of training pictures to get a high recognition rate. So it improves recognition effect of PCA in few training pictures.

The least squares method, on the other hand, has a much lower complexity. However, least squares does not promote the sparsity of signal and therefore cannot provide acceptable reconstructed results. The main contribution of this paper is to show that by exploiting signal correlation, the reconstruction error of least squares is greatly improved. Moreover, the correlated reference used in this method is very flexible, and can contain many kinds of correlation, such as spatial or temporal correlation. Experimental results show that the performance of this method is comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms, whilst having a much lower complexity. It also shows that this method can be applied to both sparse and redundant signal reconstruction.","displayPublicationTitle":"IET Intelligent Signal Processing Conference 2013 (ISP 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731804/6740486/06740488.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"IET Intelligent Signal Processing Conference 2013 (ISP 2013)","doi":"10.1049/cp.2013.2039","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2013.2039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740488","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast compressed sensing reconstruction using the least squares and signal correlation","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","correlation methods","least squares approximations","minimisation","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast compressed sensing reconstruction","signal correlation","least squares method","l1-minimisation","reconstruction error","correlated reference","spatial correlation","temporal correlation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressed sensing","least squares","correlation","redundant reconstruction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-3 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Fast compressed sensing reconstruction using the least squares and signal correlation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"13992598","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","conferenceDate":"2-3 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast compressed sensing reconstruction using the least squares and signal correlation","confLoc":"London","sourcePdf":"20132039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029491S","chronDate":"2-3 Dec. 2013","isNumber":"6740486","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6731804","citationCount":"2","articleId":"6740488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6740503,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In developing such tower model, however, studies have been conducted using a stand-alone tower or a condition where the tower and transmission lines are orthogonally crossed. This could be attributable to the difficulty in handling a complex layout in conventional experiments and theoretical studies. The present paper verifies the accuracy of the FDTD analysis, based on a comparison with the experimental results. Subsequently, it studies the influence of the layout and the inclined angle of the incoming lines to the substation on the surge response of the tower under near-real facility conditions via electromagnetic field analysis using the FDTD method. As a result, the voltage of the insulator strings peaked with a zero-degree incoming angle and it declined with increasing angle, namely by about 20% when the inclined angle was 37.5 degrees. Finally, the current waveform was analyzed in addition to the voltage characteristics and the generation mechanism of the line voltage was explained.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel7/94/6740716/06740730.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2013.004059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2013.004059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740716","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lightning surge response of a double-circuit transmission tower with incoming lines to a substation through FDTD simulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Poles and towers","Voltage measurement","Surges","Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Lightning","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","insulators","lightning protection","poles and towers","power transmission lines","substations","surge protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lightning surge response","double-circuit transmission tower","substation","transmission lines","electromagnetic field analysis","FDTD method","insulator strings","current waveform","voltage characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Transmission tower","transmission line","substation","incoming line","lightning surge","non-uniform line","lightning protection design","experiment using areduced-scale model."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740730/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Lightning surge response of a double-circuit transmission tower with incoming lines to a substation through FDTD simulation","volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6740730/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14112232","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lightning surge response of a double-circuit transmission tower with incoming lines to a substation through FDTD simulation","sourcePdf":"p096-takami.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100574S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"6740716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6740716","articleId":"6740730","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6740798,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Cai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Cai","id":"37085558444"},{"name":"Hideaki Ishii","affiliation":["Department of Computational Intelligence and Systems Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideaki","lastName":"Ishii","id":"37290764100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"6740798","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1300},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740798","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Topology","Network topology","Algorithm design and analysis","Convergence","Joints","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directed graphs","network theory (graphs)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-varying topologies","multiagent average consensus problem","connected digraphs","static digraphs","agent state changes","state sum","surplus-based averaging algorithm","necessary graphical condition","sufficient graphical condition","state averaging","network topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed consensus","jointly strongly connected digraphs","multi-agent systems","surplus-based averaging","time-varying network topologies"]}],"abstract":"We have recently proposed a \u201csurplus-based\u201d algorithm which solves the multi-agent average consensus problem on general strongly connected and static digraphs.

In this note, we extend this approach to the more interesting and challenging case of time-varying topologies: An extended surplus-based averaging algorithm is designed, under which a necessary and sufficient graphical condition is derived that guarantees state averaging. The derived condition requires only that the digraphs be arbitrary strongly connected in a joint sense, and does not impose \u201cbalanced\u201d or \u201csymmetric\u201d properties on the network topology, which is therefore more general than those previously reported in the literature.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2014.2305952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/6776438/06740798.pdf","startPage":"1066","endPage":"1071","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2014.2305952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Average Consensus on Arbitrary Strongly Connected Digraphs With Time-Varying Topologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Average Consensus on Arbitrary Strongly Connected Digraphs With Time-Varying Topologies","volume":"59","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6740798/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14182315","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Average Consensus on Arbitrary Strongly Connected Digraphs With Time-Varying Topologies","sourcePdf":"tac-cai-2305952-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075696S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6776438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6776438","articleId":"6740798","onlineDate":"14 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6740802,"authors":[{"name":"Xiongfei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg East, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6877756/6740802/6740802-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiongfei Wang (S\u201910\u2013M\u201913) received the B.Sc. degree from Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China, in 2006, and the M.Sc. degree from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2008, both in electrical engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in energy technology from Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, in 2013.","He was a Visiting Student at Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, from 2007 to 2008.

The impedance-based analytical approach is employed and expanded to a meshed and balanced three-phase network which is dominated by multiple current- and voltage-controlled inverters with LCL- and LC-filters. A method of deriving the impedance ratios for the different inverters is proposed by means of the nodal admittance matrix. Thus, the contribution of each inverter to the harmonic stability of the power system can be readily predicted through Nyquist diagrams. Time-domain simulations and experimental tests on a three-inverter-based power system are presented. The results validate the effectiveness of the theoretical approach.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2306432","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6877756/06740802.pdf","startPage":"6421","endPage":"6432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6877756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2306432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Harmonic Stability in an AC Power-Electronics-Based Power System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740802","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analysis of Harmonic Stability in an AC Power-Electronics-Based Power System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740802/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14514069","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6740802/","volume":"29","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2014","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Modeling and Analysis of Harmonic Stability in an AC Power-Electronics-Based Power System","sourcePdf":"tpel-wang-2306432-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112212S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6877756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"437","xplore-issue":"6877756","articleId":"6740802","onlineDate":"14 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6740803,"authors":[{"name":"Chu-Fu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Pingtung University of Education, Pingtung City, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Chu-Fu Wang, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Chu-Fu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538382200"},{"name":"Jau-Der Shih","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Pingtung University of Education, Pingtung City, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Jau-Der Shih, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Jau-Der","lastName":"Shih","id":"37268982100"},{"name":"Bo-Han Pan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Pingtung University of Education, Pingtung City, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Bo-Han Pan, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Bo-Han","lastName":"Pan","id":"37086629347"},{"name":"Tin-Yu Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Ilan University, Ilan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Tin-Yu Wu, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Tin-Yu","lastName":"Wu","id":"38565549100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-437X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1748"},{"format":"CD","value":"2379-9153"}],"articleNumber":"6740803","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":104,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3467},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Sensors Council","url":"http://www.ieee-sensors.org"}],"abstract":"Recent advances in micromanufacturing technology have enabled the development of low-cost, low-power, multifunctional sensor nodes for wireless communication. Diverse sensing applications have also become a reality as a result. These include environmental monitoring, intrusion detection, battlefield surveillance, and so on. In a wireless sensor network (WSN), how to conserve the limited power resources of sensors to extend the network lifetime of the WSN as long as possible while performing the sensing and sensed data reporting tasks, is the most critical issue in the network design. In a WSN, sensor nodes deliver sensed data back to the sink via multihopping. The sensor nodes near the sink will generally consume more battery power than others; consequently, these nodes will quickly drain out their battery energy and shorten the network lifetime of the WSN. Sink relocation is an efficient network lifetime extension method, which avoids consuming too much battery energy for a specific group of sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a moving strategy called energy-aware sink relocation (EASR) for mobile sinks in WSNs. The proposed mechanism uses information related to the residual battery energy of sensor nodes to adaptively adjust the transmission range of sensor nodes and the relocating scheme for the sink. Some theoretical and numerical analyze are given to show that the EASR method can extend the network lifetime of the WSN significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6787022/06740803.pdf","startPage":"1932","endPage":"1943","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2014.2306429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2014.2306429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6787022","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Network Lifetime Enhancement Method for Sink Relocation and Its Analysis in Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Batteries","Wireless sensor networks","Routing","Routing protocols","Trajectory","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery management systems","telecommunication power management","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network","EASR method","numerical analysis","adaptive transmission range adjustment","residual battery energy","mobile sinks","energy aware sink relocation","moving strategy","network lifetime extension method","multihopping","sensor nodes","WSN","network lifetime enhancement method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy-aware routing","mobile sink","sink relocation","wireless networks"]},{"kwd":["Energy-aware routing","mobile sink","sink relocation","wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Network Lifetime Enhancement Method for Sink Relocation and Its Analysis in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"14","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6740803/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14236961","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Network Lifetime Enhancement Method for Sink Relocation and Its Analysis in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jsen-wang-2306429-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11696S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6787022","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"6787022","articleId":"6740803","onlineDate":"14 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6740805,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Buizza Avanzini","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria, Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/87/6912797/6740805/avanz-2300696-small.gif","p":["Giovanni Buizza Avanzini (S'13) was born in Brescia, Italy, in 1987.

The absence of manufacturing and operational standards has led to many point-to-point HVDC links built at different voltage levels, which creates another challenge. Therefore, the issues of voltage matching and dc fault isolation are undergoing extensive research and are addressed in this paper. A quasi two-level operating mode of the modular multilevel converter is proposed, where the converter generates a square wave with controllable dv/dt by employing the cell voltages to create transient intermediate voltage levels. Cell capacitance requirements diminish and the footprint of the converter is reduced. The common-mode dc component in the arm currents is not present in the proposed operating mode. The converter is proposed as the core of a dc to dc transformer, where two converters operating in the proposed mode are coupled by an ac transformer for voltage matching and galvanic isolation. The proposed dc transformer is shown to be suitable for high-voltage high-power applications due to the low-switching frequency, high efficiency, modularity, and reliability. The dc transformer facilitates dc voltage regulation and near instant isolation of dc faults within its protection zone. Analysis and simulations confirm these capabilities in a system-oriented approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6883248/06740820.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"123","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2306453","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2306453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6883248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi Two-Level Operation of Modular Multilevel Converter for Use in a High-Power DC Transformer With DC Fault Isolation Capability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Power transformer insulation","Voltage control","Capacitance","Circuit breakers","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","power transformers","power transmission control","power transmission faults","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi two-level operation","modular multilevel converter","high-power DC transformer","DC fault isolation capability","DC fault protection","multiterminal DC grids","transient intermediate voltage levels","cell capacitance requirements","common-mode dc component","DC-DC transformer","voltage matching","galvanic isolation","low-switching frequency","DC voltage regulation","protection zone"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dual active bridge (DAB)","dc fault","dc/dc power conversion","dc transformer","modular multilevel converter (MMC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740820/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Quasi Two-Level Operation of Modular Multilevel Converter for Use in a High-Power DC Transformer With DC Fault Isolation Capability","volume":"30","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6740820/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14543390","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi Two-Level Operation of Modular Multilevel Converter for Use in a High-Power DC Transformer With DC Fault Isolation Capability","sourcePdf":"tpel-gowaid-2306453-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.199886S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6883248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"214","xplore-issue":"6883248","articleId":"6740820","onlineDate":"14 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6740822,"authors":[{"name":"Dean E.

Measured performance agrees well with 3-D particle-in-cell simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2014.2304473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2014.2304473","startPage":"1637","endPage":"1642","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/6817621/06740822.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6817621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demonstration of a Wideband 10-kW Ka-Band Sheet Beam TWT Amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of a Wideband 10-kW Ka-Band Sheet Beam TWT Amplifier","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2014","volume":"61","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6740822/","accessionNumber":"14301804","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740822/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of a Wideband 10-kW Ka-Band Sheet Beam TWT Amplifier","sourcePdf":"ted-pershing-2304473-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059233S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6817621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6817621","articleId":"6740822","onlineDate":"14 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6740833,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Gao","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Research Institute of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Gao","id":"37391541800"},{"name":"Shuang He","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Research Institute of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"He","id":"37073220500"},{"name":"Xubo Wei","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Research Institute of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xubo","lastName":"Wei","id":"37558117700"},{"name":"Ziqiang Xu","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Research Institute of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ziqiang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37670352200"},{"name":"Ning Wang","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Research Institute of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085374256"},{"name":"Yi Zheng","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Research Institute of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38026310900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6740833","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":184,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4266},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ultra wideband antennas","Ports (Computers)","Antenna radiation patterns","Antenna measurements","MIMO","Slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","coplanar waveguides","etching","microstrip antenna arrays","microwave antenna arrays","microwave resonators","MIMO communication","slot antenna arrays","UHF antennas","UHF resonators","ultra wideband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compact printed UWB diversity slot antenna","band-notched characteristics","compact printed ultrawideband slot antenna","MIMO-diversity application","CPW","coplanar waveguide feeding staircase-shaped radiating element","orthogonal radiation pattern","rectangle stub","split-ring resonator slot","SRR slot","etching","impedance bandwidth","envelope correlation coefficient","ECC","multiple-input-multiple-output system","portable device","frequency 2.5 GHz to 12 GHz","gain 10 dB","loss 15 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Band-notched","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO)","pattern diversity","slot antennas","ultrawideband (UWB) antennas"]}],"abstract":"A novel compact printed ultrawideband (UWB) slot antenna for MIMO/diversity applications is presented in this letter.

To redetect the target when drifting, a cascade detector based on random ferns is proposed. It can detect the target robustly in real time. After redetection, we also come up with a new refinement strategy to improve the tracker's performance by removing the support vectors corresponding to possible wrong updates by a matching template.

Building a general architecture for the IoT is hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may be involved in such a system. In this paper, we focus specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite a broad category, are characterized by their specific application domain. Urban IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies to support added-value services for the administration of the city and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive survey of the enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture for an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the Padova Smart City project, a proof-of-concept deployment of an IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration with the city municipality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740844/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","volume":"1","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14282877","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6740844/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Internet of Things for Smart Cities","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Internet of Things for Smart Cities","sourcePdf":"jiot-zanella-2306328-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077181S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"6810798","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"2919","xplore-issue":"6810798","articleId":"6740844","onlineDate":"14 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6740848,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Lagger","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies Austria AG, Villach, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6776447/6740848/6740848-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peter Lagger (M'07) received the master's degree in electrical engineering from the Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Vienna University of Technology in cooperation with Infineon Technologies Austria AG, Villach, Austria.","His current research interests include characterization and technology of GaN-based power devices."]},"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Lagger","id":"38466365500"},{"name":"Maria Reiner","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies Austria AG, Villach, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6776447/6740848/6740848-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Maria Reiner received the master's degree in chemistry from the University of Graz, Graz, Austria, in 2011.

In this model, the controller design relies on the observed jumping parameters, which are however delayed and thus can not be measured in real-time precisely. This delayed time interval, referred to as the \u201casynchronous switching interval\u201d, is Markovian and dependent on the actual switching signal. The sufficient conditions under which the system is either stochastically asymptotic stable or input-to-state stable are obtained by applying the extended Razumikhin-type theorem to the asynchronous switching interval. These results are less conservative as it is only required that the designed Lyapunov function is non-decreasing. It is shown that the stability of the considered system can be guaranteed by a sufficiently small mode transition rate of the underlying Markov process, which is a conclusion similar to that in asynchronous deterministic switched systems.

To alleviate this, we propose a lookup table (LUT)-based algorithm with uniform quantization to utilize estimates of the peak-to-average power ratio at the receiver to determine the OBT. To fully evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we investigate the impact of quantization bits on the system performance in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and symbol error rate under various IN scenarios. The results reveal that a 5-bit LUT is sufficient to achieve a gain of up to 3-dB SNR improvement relative to the conventional blanking method. It will also be shown that to maintain good performance, the resolution of quantization must be increased especially when the IN probability of occurrence is relatively high.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantized Peak-Based Impulsive Noise Blanking in Power-Line Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2290717","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/6861487/06740867.pdf","startPage":"1630","endPage":"1638","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2290717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6861487","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740867/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Quantized Peak-Based Impulsive Noise Blanking in Power-Line Communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6740867/","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14469319","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantized Peak-Based Impulsive Noise Blanking in Power-Line Communications","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-rabie-2290717-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073585S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6861487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6861487","articleId":"6740867","onlineDate":"14 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6740869,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Woo Moon","affiliation":["Power Conversion & Control Research Center, Korea Electrotechnology Research institute, Changwon, Korea","Department of Electrical Engineering, Pusan National University, Pusan, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/7064681/6740869/6740869-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ji-Woo Moon (S\u201913) was born in Pusan, Korea, in February 1981.

Because all combinations of the switch states are considered in order to minimize the cost function, their possible combinations increase geometrically according to the increase of the level of the MMC, which is a significant disadvantage. This paper proposes a new MPC method with a reduced number of states for ac current control, circulating current control, and the SM capacitor voltage-balancing algorithm. The proposed cost functions are divided into three types according to their control purposes. Each cost function determines the minimum number of states for controlling the ac current, circulating current, and SM capacitor voltage.

An adversary can inflict severe damage to the underlying physical system by compromising the control and monitoring applications facilitated by the cyber layer. Protection of critical assets from electronic threats has traditionally been done through conventional cyber security measures that involve host-based and network-based security technologies. However, it has been recognized that highly skilled attacks can bypass these security mechanisms to disrupt the smooth operation of control systems. There is a growing need for cyber-attack-resilient control techniques that look beyond traditional cyber defense mechanisms to detect highly skilled attacks. In this paper, we make the following contributions. We first demonstrate the impact of data integrity attacks on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) on power system frequency and electricity market operation. We propose a general framework to the application of attack resilient control to power systems as a composition of smart attack detection and mitigation. Finally, we develop a model-based anomaly detection and attack mitigation algorithm for AGC. We evaluate the detection capability of the proposed anomaly detection algorithm through simulation studies. Our results show that the algorithm is capable of detecting scaling and ramp attacks with low false positive and negative rates. The proposed model-based mitigation algorithm is also efficient in maintaining system frequency within acceptable limits during the attack period.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2014.2298195","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6740878/06740883.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2014.2298195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740878","startPage":"580","endPage":"591","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Based Attack Detection and Mitigation for Automatic Generation Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6740883","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model-Based Attack Detection and Mitigation for Automatic Generation Control","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6740883/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14111661","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6740883/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Based Attack Detection and Mitigation for Automatic Generation Control","sourcePdf":"tsg-govindarasu-2298195-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075184S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6740878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"222","xplore-issue":"6740878","articleId":"6740883","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-01"},{"_id":6740887,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Chai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6740878/6740887/6740887-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Chai received the B.Sc. degree in automation from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2010, and also graduated from Chu Kochen Honors College.","He was a visiting student at Simula Research Laboratory, Oslo, Norway in 2011.

Different from most existing studies that focus on the scenario with a single utility company, this paper studies DRM with multiple utility companies. First, the interaction between utility companies and residential users is modeled as a two-level game. That is, the competition among the utility companies is formulated as a non-cooperative game, while the interaction among the residential users is formulated as an evolutionary game. Then, we prove that the proposed strategies are able to make both games converge to their own equilibrium. In addtion, the strategies for the utility companies and the residential users are implemented by distributed algorithms.

Two methods, the nuclear norm minimization and low rank matrix factorization, are presented to solve this problem.

The first one is directly based on the eigen-decomposition of the circulant noise covariance matrix. Since the optimal solution can be accurately decomposed into sub-solutions denoted as eigenbeams and their robustness decreases with increasing of order number, a reduced-rank technique can be applied to obtain robust superdirectivity by truncating some error-intolerable high order eigenbeams. The results are all expressed in closed-form. The second approach is to formulate the beamformer as an optimization problem which can give an appropriate trade-off among directivity factor, sidelobe level and robustness. The robustness constraint parameter can be estimated from the performance of eigenbeams. Although it needs to be computed numerically, the computation efficiency can be improved using the properties of circular arrays. Experimental results show these two beamformers will provide good convenience to the practical implementation of robust high-order superdirectivity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6741027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14115413","htmlLink":"/document/6741027/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Design of robust superdirective beamformer for circular sensor arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of robust superdirective beamformer for circular sensor arrays","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"130501029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075093S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732179","isNumber":"6740936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732179","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6740936","articleId":"6741027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6741053,"authors":[{"name":"Minh T\u00e2n Pham","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Institut TELECOM; TELECOM Bretagne; UMR CNRS 6285 Lab-STICC/CID Technop\u00f4le, France"],"lastName":"Minh T\u00e2n Pham","id":"37085517727"},{"name":"Didier Gu\u00e9riot","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Institut TELECOM; TELECOM Bretagne; UMR CNRS 6285 Lab-STICC/CID Technop\u00f4le, France"],"firstName":"Didier","lastName":"Gu\u00e9riot","id":"37354863600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-933957-40-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"6741053","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Vectors","Self-organizing feature maps","Feature extraction","Standards","Neurons","Sonar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image registration","image segmentation","self-organising feature maps","sonar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised segmentation step","self organizing neural networks","textural features","unsupervised image segmentation step","side scan sonar images","extended block matching method","unsupervised Kohonen neural networks","sonar image registration","guided block matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image registration","block-matching","image segmentation","textural features","Kohonen map","sidescan sonar images"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an extended block-matching method for registrating side-scan sonar images. Indeed, this work main objective is to exploit block-matching principle and improve its performance by embedding a relevant guidance algorithm. Instead of carrying out the block-matching process on the whole input images, which takes a lot of time, an unsupervised image segmentation step is introduced prior to the matching phase in order to guide it. Thus, the block-matching is only performed on similar regions from the two segmented images, where the potential for finding relevant pairs of blocks is high. This improved version is expected to take less time than the original one. In this work, textural features extracted from both images, feed self-organizing neural networks (Kohonen maps) which implement the unsupervised segmentation step. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed guidance method by reducing registration computation time without any quality loss when compared to the regular block-matching algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Guided block-matching for sonar image registration using unsupervised Kohonen neural networks","publicationTitle":"2013 OCEANS - San Diego","doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2013.6741053","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 OCEANS - San Diego","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732179/6740936/06741053.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS.2013.6741053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740936","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6741053","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6741053/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Guided block-matching for sonar image registration using unsupervised Kohonen neural networks","conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6741053/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14127161","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Guided block-matching for sonar image registration using unsupervised Kohonen neural networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"130502026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057455S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732179","isNumber":"6740936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732179","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6740936","articleId":"6741053","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6741109,"authors":[{"name":"Yanbo Wu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Ocean Acoustic Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yanbo Wu","id":"38244461900"},{"name":"Min Zhu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Ocean Acoustic Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Min Zhu","id":"37067759200"},{"name":"Weiqing Zhu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Ocean Acoustic Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Weiqing Zhu","id":"37086717159"},{"name":"Zeping Xing","affiliation":["Laboratory of Ocean Acoustic Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zeping Xing","id":"38198056700"},{"name":"Lijun Xu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Ocean Acoustic Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lijun Xu","id":"38244268200"},{"name":"Bo Yang","affiliation":["Laboratory of Ocean Acoustic Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Bo Yang","id":"37086721729"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-933957-40-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"6741109","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":201},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Error correction codes","Error correction","Underwater acoustics","Concatenated codes","Bit error rate","Probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concatenated codes","iterative decoding","parity check codes","probability","Rayleigh channels","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncoherent underwater acoustic communication","nonbinary LDPC code","phase random","Rayleigh fading channel","iterative decoding","probability domain","moment estimation","posterior probability","constant weight code-words","nonbinary sum-product algorithm","noniterative concatenated code","deep ocean","vertical communication","shallow lake","horizontal communication","data transmission rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noncoherent underwater acoustic communication","Rayleigh fading channel","nonbinary LDPC code","Hadamard code"]}],"abstract":"Noncoherent underwater acoustic communication channel in adverse condition is modeled as phase-random Rayleigh fading channel.

The distance of wireless communications between buoys is critical for oceanographic monitoring. In this paper, a new technique is presented to improve the distance of marine wireless communication using beamforming. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) which consists of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers is installed on the buoy node to track the realtime attitude of the antenna array. The realtime attitude of the antenna array is calculated with a filter scheme. With the result, the relative direction of the destination node to the antenna array is obtained. Then a corresponding algorithm is selected to control phased array antenna beamforming parameters, directing the beam at the destination node. In addition, the solution is simulated under the condition of regular waves. The results reveal that the beamforming technique provides significant power gains and improve the distance between two communicating nodes effectively.","doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2013.6741142","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 OCEANS - San Diego","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732179/6740936/06741142.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS.2013.6741142","publicationTitle":"2013 OCEANS - San Diego","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beamforming for wireless communications between buoys","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6741142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming for wireless communications between buoys","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6741142/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6741142/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14115283","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming for wireless communications between buoys","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"130503060.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066075S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732179","isNumber":"6740936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732179","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6740936","articleId":"6741142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6741170,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenrui Chen","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenrui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085335820"},{"name":"Yahong Rosa Zheng","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Eng., Missouri University of Science & Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Yahong Rosa","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38184497400"},{"name":"Jintao Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jintao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37539000300"},{"name":"Jian Song","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Song","id":"37290858000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-933957-40-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"6741170","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler effect","Estimation","Noise measurement","Synchronization","OFDM","Multipath channels","Underwater acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic correlation","channel estimation","Doppler effect","frequency estimation","frequency-domain analysis","OFDM modulation","random noise","random sequences","synchronisation","time-domain analysis","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual PN padding TDS-OFDM","underwater acoustic communication","Doppler scale estimation method","time domain synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","dual frequency-domain pseudorandom noise sequence","PN training sequence","channel estimation","carrier frequency offset estimation","CFO estimation","two-dimensional autocorrelation","Doppler effect"]}],"abstract":"We propose a joint synchronization and Doppler scale estimation method with time domain synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (TDS-OFDM) for underwater acoustic communication.

For active sonar systems that use azimuthally omnidirectional transmitters the bottom, surface, shoreline reverberation and clutter can be quite challenging to overcome when using Doppler sensitive waveforms, especially for low velocity targets. Straightforward application of adaptive beamforming to increase resolution for active sonar is typically challenged by snapshot deficiency. This deficiency is caused by the conflicting requirements for high Doppler resolution for target detection and small time windows for building up a full-rank signal covariance estimates. It has been proposed recently to overcome these limitations through the use of reduced beamspace adaptive beamforming. [1] The Subarray MVDR beamformer is a method of adaptive beamforming that reduces the required degrees of freedom by splitting the array into sub arrays which are first conventionally beamformed. The subarray beams are then adaptively combined to form adaptive weights using the subarray centers as the element spacing. This approach can eliminate the snapshot deficiency problem while still outperforming a conventional beamformer in both Doppler and bearing resolution. This method also more robust to errors in the signal model that can lead to signal suppression. The Subarray MVDR beamformer is analyzed in this paper both against both simulated data and against experimental data collected during the GLINT/NGAS11 experiment conducted by the Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) in 2011. This experiment consisted of towed arrays deployed by AUVs in a multistatic experiment where the detection of returns of Doppler sensitive waveforms from an Echo Repeater towed at low speed was being attempted in the presence heavy shoreline reverberation. Simulation results indicate that the Subarray MVDR beamformer shows promising rejection of interfering signals that are not effectively attenuated by conventional beamforming. The application of the Subarray MVDR beamformer to the experimental data then shows that the Doppler spread of the reverberation ridge is significantly reduced, and the bearing resolution significantly improved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6741215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14115260","htmlLink":"/document/6741215/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"The subarray MVDR beamformer for active littoral sonar systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The subarray MVDR beamformer for active littoral sonar systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"130503164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053778S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732179","isNumber":"6740936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732179","xplore-issue":"6740936","articleId":"6741215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6741217,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Hofmann","affiliation":["Ocean Networks Canada, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Hofmann","id":"37585834800"},{"name":"Ryan Flagg","affiliation":["Ocean Networks Canada, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Flagg","id":"37086273124"},{"name":"Ryan Key","affiliation":["Ocean Networks Canada, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Key","id":"37086727346"},{"name":"Kathryn Moran","affiliation":["Ocean Networks Canada, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC"],"firstName":"Kathryn","lastName":"Moran","id":"38099188800"},{"name":"Scott McLean","affiliation":["Ocean Networks Canada, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"McLean","id":"37400090200"},{"name":"S.

These areas provide challenges in a number of areas; environmental, logistic and social. In this paper we will discuss how these challenges are met and some strategies that we use to help ensure successful deployments of these stations. The engineering of these projects required new technology to be developed to deal with the different environments. In some respects things are easier, the platforms currently deployed and planned for future deployment are all in shallow water and in seismically quiet zones. However, the remote location and extreme weather conditions in the Arctic provide new challenges. There are three main components to these system: the underwater platform connecting all the instruments to the relay station on shore that includes a weather station and camera and transmits all the data to the shore station that buffers and forwards data to a data centre. The main challenge for the underwater component is to ensure that the ice does not interfere with the systems. The land-based relay tower uses wireless networking components that are vulnerable to environmental damage and vandalism. The final transmission of data from the shore station to the data centre is done through a commercial satellite-based channel that is also subject to weather and other environmental challenges, has relatively low bandwidth and is not 100% reliable. The remote observing stations were designed to be relatively small and lightweight so that one or two people can easily deploy and recover the main sensor tripod using only a small boat and a diver. The major engineering obstacles for the arctic deployment were the extreme low temperatures experienced during the winter months and the formation (and especially the subsequent break-up) of surface sea-ice. The relay station is perhaps the most vulnerable link in the whole system. Data are generally not buffered before reaching the shore station so any failure of the system prior to that will result in data loss. The relay component is located beside the water and is more exposed to the elements. Once the data reach the shore station, servers buffer the data. Buffering protects data against network outages and allows large data sets such as video data to be sent later at a reduced bandwidth. Logistics requires careful planning as only limited supplies are available on site. Keeping the platforms relatively small not only reduces the overall cost of deployment and general maintenance but also allows for a greater amount of community involvement and personal interaction. Involving the community in the project significantly increases chances of success. To date Ocean Networks Canada has deployed two observing stations, one at Brentwood College School (BCS) near Victoria, BC and one in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, in Canada's high Arctic. The first installation, BCS, was a proof of concept and served as a test for the second installation in a remote location. More installations are being planned and refinements are in the works to improve the system. Using copper cable for data transmission limits the length of cable that can be used, this limit can be greatly extended by using fibre optic cables for data transmission. ONC has also designed new underwater interface cans to connect instruments to shore. These new devices will have the ability to support more instruments and provide better monitoring and control. They also allow greater flexibility in the variety of instruments that can be connected to the observing stations.","doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2013.6741217","publicationTitle":"2013 OCEANS - San Diego","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 OCEANS - San Diego","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732179/6740936/06741217.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS.2013.6741217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cabled observing stations for remote locations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6741217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6741217/","displayDocTitle":"Cabled observing stations for remote locations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14115321","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6741217/","conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cabled observing stations for remote locations","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"130503167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040174S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732179","isNumber":"6740936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732179","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6740936","articleId":"6741217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6741240,"authors":[{"name":"Jason D.

Via theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, it is shown that the MIMO sonar doubles the cross-range resolution, when compared to the traditional 2-D sector-scan sonar.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-resolution 2-D sector-scan imaging using MIMO sonar with narrowband LFM pulses","publicationTitle":"2013 OCEANS - San Diego","doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2013.6741286","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 OCEANS - San Diego","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732179/6740936/06741286.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS.2013.6741286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740936","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6741286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6741286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution 2-D sector-scan imaging using MIMO sonar with narrowband LFM pulses","conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6741286/","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14115207","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution 2-D sector-scan imaging using MIMO sonar with narrowband LFM pulses","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"130504013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047129S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732179","isNumber":"6740936","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732179","xplore-issue":"6740936","articleId":"6741286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"MTS","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6741335,"authors":[{"name":"Yixin Yang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, 710072"],"firstName":"Yixin","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Yong Wang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, 710072"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Yuanliang Ma","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, 710072"],"firstName":"Yuanliang","lastName":"Ma"},{"name":"Chao Sun","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, 710072"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Sun"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-933957-40-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0197-7385"}],"articleNumber":"6741335","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6741335","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Sensor arrays","Array signal processing","Noise","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing","conformal antennas","optimisation","sensor arrays","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conformal vector array","vector sensor","robust supergain beamforming method","optimization problem","second order cone programming","manifold vector","noise correlation matrix","noise field information","array gain enhancement","sidelobe level","beampattern","arbitrary array","channel response directivity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["conformal vector arrays","supergain","robustness","optimization","second-order cone programming"]}],"doi":"10.23919/OCEANS.2013.6741335","publicationTitle":"2013 OCEANS - San Diego","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 OCEANS - San Diego","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732179/6740936/06741335.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.23919/OCEANS.2013.6741335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740936","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental study on robust supergain beamforming for conformal vector arrays","abstract":"An experimental conformal array with vector sensors is designed and its supergain performance is studied in this paper.

They may illustrate how some key issues come up and disappear from time to time, but they typically provide limited information about relationships of interest. Financial and economic analysts are often interested in how financial or economic performance indicators interplay or change over time. With a set of well-defined and commonly used equations or indicators in the domain of Economics and Finance, we can refine our visualization by keeping track of these variables. In this paper, we make use of a line plot layout to track some of these indicators and leverage word clouds to reveal how these indicators are affected by the changes in social and economic environments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Market research","Economic indicators","Semantics","Tag clouds","Data visualization","Color"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","financial data processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TrendFocus","financial news","indicator sets","time-series data visualization approach","economic analysts","financial analysts","economic environments","social environments","trend visualization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Financial News Visualization","Trend Focus","Domain Knowledge Visualization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/BIGCOMP.2014.6741396","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BIGCOMP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BIGCOMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731712/6741395/06741396.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6741395","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIGCOMP.2014.6741396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TrendFocus: Visualization of trends in financial news with indicator sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6741396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"TrendFocus: Visualization of trends in financial news with indicator sets","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6741396/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6741396/","accessionNumber":"14115083","conferenceDate":"15-17 Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Jan. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TrendFocus: Visualization of trends in financial news with indicator sets","confLoc":"Bangkok, Thailand","sourcePdf":"IS11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064521S","chronDate":"15-17 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6731712","isNumber":"6741395","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6731712","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6741395","articleId":"6741396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6741398,"authors":[{"name":"Pio Claudio","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, KAIST"],"firstName":"Pio","lastName":"Claudio","id":"37086766023"},{"name":"Sung-Eui Yoon","affiliation":["Division of Web Science and Technology, KAIST"],"lastName":"Sung-Eui Yoon","id":"37066068100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3919-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2375-933X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9356"}],"articleNumber":"6741398","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Visualization","Navigation","Optimization","Transportation","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cartography","computerised navigation","data visualisation","railways"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["octilinear layouts","metro map visualization","octilinear design","metro map layout","personal navigational devices","personal navigational platforms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6741398","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BIGCOMP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731712/6741395/06741398.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"21","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIGCOMP.2014.6741398","doi":"10.1109/BIGCOMP.2014.6741398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6741395","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (BIGCOMP)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Octilinear layouts for metro map visualization","abstract":"Octilinear design has been a feature of metro maps since the last century.

This paper introduces the importance of imbalanced data classification in various fields first; then, contends existing methods of solving the imbalanced data classification problem; finally, proposes two new sampling methods, which are based on borderline-SMOTE, for the imbalanced data with high density, especially for big data with this kind of distribution feature. These two new algorithms are not only over-sampling the minority samples near the borderline, but also creating appropriate synthetic samples in the majority class samples side and under-sampling some particular majority class samples.

Our approach is based on a joint duty-cycle optimization and transmission power control. By simultaneously adapting both parameters, the node can maximize the number of transmitted packets while respecting the limited and time-varying amount of available energy. We obtain a high-packet delivery by using an original predictive transmission power control that can efficiently adapt the transmission power to the wireless channel conditions. To accurately model the wireless channel and the node communication hardware, a waveform-level radio frequency simulator has been developed. Simulation results show 6.5 times improvement in energy efficiency and a packet reception ratio which is 9 times more efficient than a recently published technique. A 15% increase in energy efficiency, with respect to a fixed transmission power configuration, has also been observed. Finally, the global power management strategy has been validated on a real wireless sensor networks platform. Experimental results are very similar to those obtained in simulations, and thus confirm the efficiency of our power management approach.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2014.2306327","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2014.2306327","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

However, the diversity of the objects in IoT causes the heterogeneity problem of the data format in IoT platform. Meanwhile, the use of IoT technology in applications has spurred the increase of real-time data, which makes the information storage and accessing more difficult and challenging. In this research, first a semantic data model is proposed to store and interpret IoT data. Then a resource-based data accessing method (UDA-IoT) is designed to acquire and process IoT data ubiquitously to improve the accessibility to IoT data resources. Finally, we present an IoT-based system for emergency medical services to demonstrate how to collect, integrate, and interoperate IoT data flexibly in order to provide support to emergency medical services. The result shows that the resource-based IoT data accessing method is effective in a distributed heterogeneous data environment for supporting data accessing timely and ubiquitously in a cloud and mobile computing platform.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/6809862/06742577.pdf","startPage":"1578","endPage":"1586","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2014.2306382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2014.2306382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ubiquitous Data Accessing Method in IoT-Based Information System for Emergency Medical Services","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Information systems","Hospitals","Distributed databases","Business"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data acquisition","data integration","emergency services","health care","information retrieval","Internet of Things","medical information systems","mobile computing","open systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ubiquitous data accessing method","IoT-based information system","Internet of Things","IoT technology","smart objects","data interoperability methods","information intensive industrial sectors","healthcare services","object diversity","data format heterogeneity problem","information storage","semantic data model","UDA-IoT","IoT data resources accessibility","emergency medical services","IoT data collection","IoT data integration","IoT data interoperability","resource-based IoT data accessing method","distributed heterogeneous data environment","cloud computing platform","mobile computing platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decision support system (DSS)","emergencymedical service","Internet of things (IoT)","resource model","ubiquitous data accessing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Ubiquitous Data Accessing Method in IoT-Based Information System for Emergency Medical Services","volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6742577/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267630","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ubiquitous Data Accessing Method in IoT-Based Information System for Emergency Medical Services","sourcePdf":"tii-cai-2306382-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096123S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6809862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"331","xplore-issue":"6809862","articleId":"6742577","onlineDate":"17 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6742580,"authors":[{"name":"Antti Anttonen","affiliation":["VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6814813/6742580/6742580-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antti Anttonen (M\u201910) received the M.Sc.

Specifically, a mobile user is streaming a video with a limited length and variable bit rate video encoding. The playback interruptions are caused by random packet delays occurring in the wireless link between the source and destination nodes. The dynamics of the playback buffer in the user terminal is modeled as a G/G/1 queue. To evaluate the video interruption probability, a simple asymptotic method has been presented for the case in which the video length approaches infinity. However, in many practical cases, the video length is limited, hindering the usage of the asymptotic method. We obtain a simple and closed-form upper bound for the analysis of the interruption probability that incorporates the effect of finite video lengths with known statistical delay parameters. Furthermore, a useful method is presented to select between the proposed method and the asymptotic method whose relative accuracy changes with the video length and statistical properties of the buffer load size. The accuracy of the proposed analytical method is compared with the existing methods. Finally, we address some practical challenges in buffer dimensioning when the statistical delay parameters are unknown and estimated with a finite number of received packets.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2014.2306656","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2014.2306656","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/6814813/06742580.pdf","startPage":"1176","endPage":"1180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6814813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interruption Probability of Wireless Video Streaming With Limited Video Lengths","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Interruption Probability of Wireless Video Streaming With Limited Video Lengths","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14299443","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6742580/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interruption Probability of Wireless Video Streaming With Limited Video Lengths","sourcePdf":"tmm-anttonen-2306656-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146451S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6814813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6814813","articleId":"6742580","onlineDate":"17 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6742584,"authors":[{"name":"Lihong Jiang","affiliation":["School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6809862/6742584/6742584-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lihong Jiang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science, and the Ph.D. degree in management science from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 1989, 1992, and 1996, respectively.","Currently, she is an Associate Professor with the Software School, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.

Benefiting from RFID and sensor network technology, common physical objects can be connected, and are able to be monitored and managed by a single system. Such a network brings a series of challenges for data storage and processing in a cloud platform. IoT data can be generated quite rapidly, the volume of data can be huge and the types of data can be various. In order to address these potential problems, this paper proposes a data storage framework not only enabling efficient storing of massive IoT data, but also integrating both structured and unstructured data. This data storage framework is able to combine and extend multiple databases and Hadoop to store and manage diverse types of data collected by sensors and RFID readers. In addition, some components are developed to extend the Hadoop to realize a distributed file repository, which is able to process massive unstructured files efficiently. A prototype system based on the proposed framework is also developed to illustrate the framework's effectiveness.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/6809862/06742584.pdf","startPage":"1443","endPage":"1451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2014.2306384","doi":"10.1109/TII.2014.2306384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An IoT-Oriented Data Storage Framework in Cloud Computing Platform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"An IoT-Oriented Data Storage Framework in Cloud Computing Platform","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742584/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6742584/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267603","volume":"10","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An IoT-Oriented Data Storage Framework in Cloud Computing Platform","sourcePdf":"tii-cai-2306384-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139193S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6809862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"214","xplore-issue":"6809862","articleId":"6742584","onlineDate":"17 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6742587,"authors":[{"name":"Guangyi Xiao","affiliation":["University of Macau, Macau, Taipa"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6809862/6742587/6742587-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guangyi Xiao (M\u201910) received the Master\u2019s degree in software engineering from the University of Macau, Macau, China, in 2009.

This seriously hinders the development of Internet of Things. This paper addresses the problems appearing in device discovery and device interaction. It devises a user interoperability framework (UIF) to enable device users to interoperate with heterogeneous devices of different contexts with consistent syntax and semantics. In this framework, a new separation strategy is provided; a device representation method for real, common, and virtual devices is devised; and a device transformability model is proposed to guarantee the proper transformation of device syntax and semantics. To demonstrate the correctness of UIF, a UIF prototype is implemented and several experiment methods are compared to determine which one should be adopted as semantic relatedness computing tools in device discovery for device users and in common device publishing for device providers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/6809862/06742587.pdf","startPage":"1486","endPage":"1496","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2014.2306772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2014.2306772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Interoperability With Heterogeneous IoT Devices Through Transformation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interoperability","Syntactics","Semantics","Context","Object recognition","Telescopes","Ontologies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","open systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous IoT devices","Internet of Things","device discovery","device interaction","user interoperability framework","heterogeneous devices","consistent syntax","semantics","separation strategy","device representation method","device transformability model","device syntax","UIF prototype","semantic relatedness computing tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Collaborative sign","cosign","device","device interoperability","Internet of Things (IoT)","transformation","user interoperability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"User Interoperability With Heterogeneous IoT Devices Through Transformation","volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6742587/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267611","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Interoperability With Heterogeneous IoT Devices Through Transformation","sourcePdf":"tii-guo-2306772-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10757S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6809862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"6809862","articleId":"6742587","onlineDate":"17 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6742593,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Kang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Distributed Computing and Service (BUPT), Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Kai Kang received the M.S.E. degree from the School of Software Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2011.

In this model, application trustworthiness (AT) is quantitatively evaluated by the similarity between the application's behavior and the behavior expected by the user. In particular, by using the evaluation vector and feedback vector feature of application in the marketplace and behavior of applications on end devices can be exchanged in mathematical form to establish the connection between market and users. Behavior-based detecting agent on a users' device gives strong evidence about what applications have done to your privacy and security issues.

However, the current connect number, sampling rate, and signal types of sensors are generally restricted by the device. Meanwhile, in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, each sensor connected to the device is required to write complicated and cumbersome data collection program code. In this paper, to solve these problems, a new method is proposed to design a reconfigurable smart sensor interface for industrial WSN in IoT environment, in which complex programmable logic device (CPLD) is adopted as the core controller. Thus, it can read data in parallel and in real time with high speed on multiple different sensor data. The standard of IEEE1451.2 intelligent sensor interface specification is adopted for this design. It comprehensively stipulates the smart sensor hardware and software design framework and relevant interface protocol to realize the intelligent acquisition for common sensors. A new solution is provided for the traditional sensor data acquisitions. The device is combined with the newest CPLD programmable technology and the standard of IEEE1451.2 intelligent sensor specification. Performance of the proposed system is verified and good effects are achieved in practical application of IoT to water environment monitoring.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2014.2306798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2014.2306798","endPage":"1425","publicationTitle":"IEEE

In order to achieve intelligent perception and access of various manufacturing resources, the applications of IoT technologies in CMfg has been investigated in this paper. The classification of manufacturing resources and services, as well as their relationships, are presented. A five-layered structure (i.e., resource layer, perception layer, network layer, service layer, and application layer) resource intelligent perception and access system based on IoT is designed and presented. The key technologies for intelligent perception and access of various resources (i.e., hard manufacturing resources, computational resources, and intellectual resources) in CMfg are described. A prototype application system is developed to valid the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742605/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267612","htmlLink":"/document/6742605/","displayDocTitle":"IoT-Based Intelligent Perception and Access of Manufacturing Resource Toward Cloud Manufacturing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IoT-Based Intelligent Perception and Access of Manufacturing Resource Toward Cloud Manufacturing","sourcePdf":"tii-zuo-2306397-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.357992S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6809862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"377","xplore-issue":"6809862","articleId":"6742605","onlineDate":"17 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-15"},{"_id":6742607,"authors":[{"name":"Hongming Cai","affiliation":["School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6809862/6742607/6742607-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hongming Cai received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Shaanxi, China, in 1996, 1999, and 2002, respectively.","Currently, he is an Associate Professor with the School of Software, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.

Next, we design a new four-level hypothesis blind detector for spectrum sensing in such cognitive radio system and show that the proposed detector is less vulnerable to I/Q imbalance than conventional two-level detectors.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2306684","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6923505/06742610.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2306684","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"4136","endPage":"4141","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Effect of I/Q Imbalance on Energy Detection and a Novel Four-Level Hypothesis Spectrum Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"On the Effect of I/Q Imbalance on Energy Detection and a Novel Four-Level Hypothesis Spectrum Sensing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742610/","volume":"63","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6742610/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665059","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Singapore University Technology and Design","grantNumber":"SUTD-ZJU/RES/02/2011"},{"fundingName":"Iran Telecommunication Research Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Effect of I/Q Imbalance on Energy Detection and a Novel Four-Level Hypothesis Spectrum Sensing","sourcePdf":"tvt-yuen-2306684-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120325S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6923505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6923505","articleId":"6742610","onlineDate":"17 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6742615,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Shoaib","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7014337/6742615/shoai-2301733-small.gif","p":["Mohammed Shoaib (S'08\u2013M'13) received the B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees in electrical engineering from IIT, Madras, India, in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.","He is a Researcher with Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, USA.

We present an approach that enables efficient representations based on sparsity to be utilized throughout a signal processing system, with the aim of reducing the energy and/or resources required for computation, communication, and storage. The representation we focus on is compressive sensing. Its benefit is that compression is achieved with minimal computational cost through the use of random projections; however, a key drawback is that reconstruction is expensive. We focus on inference frameworks for signal analysis. We show that reconstruction can be avoided entirely by transforming signal processing operations (e.g., wavelet transforms, finite impulse response filters, etc.) such that they can be applied directly to the compressed representations. We present a methodology and a mathematical framework that achieve this goal and also enable significant computational-energy savings through operations over fewer input samples. This enables explicit energy-versus-accuracy tradeoffs that are under the control of the designer. We demonstrate the approach through two case studies. First, we consider a system for neural prosthesis that extracts wavelet features directly from compressively sensed spikes. Through simulations, we show that spike sorting can be achieved with 54\u00d7 fewer samples, providing an accuracy of 98.63% in spike count, 98.56% in firing-rate estimation, and 96.51% in determining the coefficient of variation; this compares with a baseline Nyquist-domain detector with corresponding performance of 98.97%, 99.69%, and 97.09%, respectively. Second, we consider a system for detecting epileptic seizures by extracting spectral-energy features directly from compressively sensed electroencephalogram. Through simulations of the end-to-end algorithm, we show that detection can be achieved with 21\u00d7 fewer samples, providing a sensitivity of 94.43%, false alarm rate of 0.1543/h, and latency of 4.70 s; this compares with a baseline Nyquist-domain detector with corresponding performance of 96.03%, 0.1471/h, and 4.59 s, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Processing With Direct Computations on Compressively Sensed Data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2301733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7014337/06742615.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2301733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7014337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Signal Processing With Direct Computations on Compressively Sensed Data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6742615/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14869965","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Harold W.

The design targets batteryless RF energy harvesting applications with typical input power ranging from ~ 10 to ~ 100 \u03bcW. Energy is stored in a low leakage capacitor. In order to allow activation in discharged states, the PMU implements a low-voltage start-up stage, whose current consumption is specifically optimized for biasing the rectifier accordingly. When a sufficient voltage is reached, the PMU activates a more efficient boost converter stage with maximum power point tracking capabilities and micro-power consumption. Such two circuits are designed to provide two very different loading conditions to the rectifier. A joint design of the nonlinear rectifier paths and of the two PMU subsystems based on two specific optimizations of the matching networks is proposed, along with a circuit solution for automatically switching between the start-up stage and the boost converter. In order to validate the concept, a microstrip prototype operating at 900 MHz with a discrete components PMU is characterized, although the proposed idea is fully technology independent. With respect to a conventional rectifier, the proposed design allows the system to operate with significantly lower input power, while preserving efficiency during steady-state power conversion.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and

footprint, carbon labeling, and carbon trading have attracted much attention recently due to severe environmental challenges. One key technology for implementing the above concepts is how to realize the effective quantitative evaluation of ESER. In this paper, the existing ESER evaluation technology and systems are summarized first. It is found that the existing ESER evaluation technology and systems are almost isolated from the existing enterprise information systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), product data management (PDM), and customer relationship management (CRM), which results in the expanding of the enterprise information islands. In order to address this problem, a new method for ESER life cycle assessment (LCA) based on Internet of Things (IoT) and bill of material (BOM) is proposed in this paper. A four-layered structure (i.e., perception access layer, data layer, service layer, and application layer) ESER LCA system based on IoT and BOM is designed and presented, as well as the key technologies and the functions in each layer. A prototype application system is developed to validate the proposed method.

For example, realistic-sized power systems include thousands of buses, generators, and transmission lines. Massive-thread computing is one of the key developments that can increase the EMT computational capabilities substantially when the processing unit has enough hardware cores. Compared to the traditional CPU, the graphic-processing unit (GPU) has many more cores with distributed memory which can offer higher data throughput. This paper proposes a massive-thread EMT program (MT-EMTP) and develops massive-thread parallel modules for linear passive elements, the universal line model, and the universal machine model for offline EMT simulation. An efficient node-mapping structure is proposed to transform the original power system admittance matrix into a block-node diagonal sparse format to exploit the massive-thread parallel GPU architecture. The developed MT-EMTP program has been tested on large-scale power systems of up to 2458 three-phase buses with detailed component modeling. The simulation results and execution times are compared with mainstream commercial software, EMTP-RV, to show the improvement in performance with equivalent accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2297119","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/6819482/06742641.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2297119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819482","startPage":"1045","endPage":"1053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Massive-Thread Electromagnetic Transient Simulation on GPU","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742641","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Massive-Thread Electromagnetic Transient Simulation on GPU","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742641/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"29","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14318894","dateOfInsertion":"21 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6742641/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Massive-Thread Electromagnetic Transient Simulation on GPU","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-zhou-2297119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079349S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6819482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6819482","articleId":"6742641","onlineDate":"17 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6742712,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37899839400"},{"name":"Janis Werner","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Janis","lastName":"Werner","id":"38581077100"},{"name":"Mikko Valkama","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Valkama","id":"37267657500"},{"name":"Danijela Cabric","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Danijela","lastName":"Cabric","id":"37271490100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6742712","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":658},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Shadow mapping","Algorithm design and analysis","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","direction-of-arrival estimation","directive antennas","least mean squares methods","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple nodes","SLS algorithm","Stansfield algorithm","PU localization","MSE","simplified least square algorithm","mean square error","directional antennas","sectorized antennas","CR","cognitive radio networks","primary user RSS-DoA estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sectorized antennas","RSS/DoA estimation","passive localization","Stansfield algorithm","performance analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742712","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2014.021314.140007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","abstract":"In this letter we present analytical performance evaluation of primary user (PU) RSS/DoA estimation and localization through cooperating cognitive radios (CRs).

At first, the related optimization problems are shown to be quasiconcave under both per-node and sum power constraints. Given the non-linearity of the derivative, bisection is then proposed to obtain the optimal power strategies. The capacity and optimal schemes are then analyzed in different high power regions. Specifically, we apply the dominant balance method to show that full power at the relay is suboptimal when its power constraint approaches a large value. Following a similar approach, we then show that the multiplexing gain of the FD scheme with the optimal allocation is 1/[1 + \u03bb].

Besides the remarkable hardware savings, the ESPAR capabilities are still limited as it is not possible to find appropriate loadings that multiplex any signaling format over the air. Indeed, commonly the loading values are obtained through time-consuming iterative algorithms, e.g. exhaustive search, and can only emulate MIMO transmission of signals emerging from low-order constellations. This paper constitutes a clear step forward in solving this problem, as it defines the necessary guidelines for the design of single-fed ESPAR systems that are able to support an arbitrary precoding scheme. To alleviate the need for iterative processes, the proposed design methodology uses complex tunable loads and introduces new closed-form expressions for the exact computation of the loads and the feeding voltage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arbitrary Precoding with Single-Fed Parasitic Arrays: Closed-Form Expressions and Design Guidelines","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2014.020614.130863","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/6797984/06742715.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2014.020614.130863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797984","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742715/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Arbitrary Precoding with Single-Fed Parasitic Arrays: Closed-Form Expressions and Design Guidelines","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6742715/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14239328","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arbitrary Precoding with Single-Fed Parasitic Arrays: Closed-Form Expressions and Design Guidelines","sourcePdf":"229-wcl1404-vlasis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084376S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6797984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6797984","articleId":"6742715","onlineDate":"17 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6742716,"authors":[{"name":"Tareq Y.

While OFDM is ideally suited to deal with frequency selective channels and AWGN, its performance may be dramatically impacted by the presence of impulse noise. In fact, very strong noise impulses in the time domain might result in the erasure of whole OFDM blocks of symbols at the receiver. Impulse noise can be mitigated by considering it as a sparse signal in time, and using recently developed algorithms for sparse signal reconstruction. We propose an algorithm that utilizes the guard band null subcarriers for the impulse noise estimation and cancellation.

However, its use in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is limited, since commercial scatter radio (e.g. RFID) offers short ranges of a few tens of meters. This work redesigns scatter radio systems and maximizes range through non-classic bistatic architectures: the carrier emitter is detached from the reader. It is shown that conventional radio receivers may show a potential 3dB performance loss, since they do not exploit the correct signal model for scatter radio links. Receivers for on-off-keying (OOK) and frequency-shift keying (FSK) that overcome the frequency offset between the carrier emitter and the reader are presented. Additionally, non-coherent designs are also offered. This work emphasizes that sensor tag design should accompany receiver design. Impact of important parameters such as the antenna structural mode are presented through bit error rate (BER) results. Experimental measurements corroborate the long-range ability of bistatic radio; ranges of up to 130 meters with 20 milliwatts of carrier power are experimentally demonstrated, with commodity software radio and no directional antennas. Therefore, bistatic scatter radio may be viewed as a key enabling technology for large-scale, low-cost and low-power WSNs.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.020314.130559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6777265/06742719.pdf","startPage":"1091","endPage":"1104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777265","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.020314.130559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increased Range Bistatic Scatter Radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Increased Range Bistatic Scatter Radio","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742719/","publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14236069","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6742719/","volume":"62","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increased Range Bistatic Scatter Radio","sourcePdf":"1091-tc1403-john.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123241S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6777265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"6777265","articleId":"6742719","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6742720,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6777265/6742720/6742720-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Feng Han (S'08-M'14) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively; and the Ph.D. degree from University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, in 2013, all in Electrical Engineering.

Previous work on TRDMA mainly focuses on the multi-user downlink system. In this paper, we first introduce a TRDMA-based multi-user uplink architecture and then propose a 2D parallel interference cancellation scheme to enhance system performance. The TRDMA uplink architecture keeps the cost of endusers at a minimum level, and reuses the processing power at the base station that has already been made available for the downlink. The proposed 2D parallel interference cancellation scheme utilizes tentative decisions of detected symbols to effectively cancel both inter-symbol interference and inter-user interference, which significantly improve the bit-error-rate (BER) performance in high SNR regime. To further improve BER performance, a multi-stage processing can be implemented by cascading multiple stages of the proposed 2D interference cancellation, with a total delay that increases linearly with the number of stages, but independent of the number of users. The BER performance of the single-stage cancellation is analyzed, and the approximated theoretical result well matches the simulation results. Simulations are provided for up-to 3 stages of interference cancellation and compared with the basic TRDMA system without interference cancellation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.013114.130632","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777265","startPage":"1011","endPage":"1022","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6777265/06742720.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiuser TRDMA Uplink System with 2D Parallel Interference Cancellation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742720/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6742720/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Multiuser TRDMA Uplink System with 2D Parallel Interference Cancellation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14236070","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiuser TRDMA Uplink System with 2D Parallel Interference Cancellation","sourcePdf":"1011-tc1403-han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072151S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6777265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6777265","articleId":"6742720","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6742722,"authors":[{"name":"Sha Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6777265/6742722/6742722-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sha Wei received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electronic engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

In contrast to the conventional XOR-based network coding (CXNC), the relay in PANC generates network coded symbols by considering the coefficients of the source-to-relay channels, and forwards each symbol with a pre-optimized power level. Specifically, by defining a symbol pair as two symbols from the two sources, we first derive the expression of symbol pair error rate (SPER) for the system. Noting that deriving the exact SPER are complex due to the irregularity of the decision regions caused by random channel coefficients, we propose a coordinate transform (CT) method on the received constellation to simplify the derivations of the SPER. Next, we obtain the optimal power level by decomposing it as a multiplication of a power scaling factor and a power adaptation factor. We prove that with the power scaling factor at the relay, our PANC scheme can achieve a full diversity gain, i.e., an order of two diversity gain, while the CXNC can achieve only an order of one diversity gain. In addition, we optimize the power adaptation factor at the relay to minimize the SPER at the destination by considering of the relationship between SPER and minimum Euclidean distance of the received constellation, resulting in an improved coding gain. Simulation results show that (1) the SPER derived based on our CT method can well approximate the exact SPER with a much lower complexity; (2) the PANC scheme with power adaptation optimizations and power scaling factor design can achieve a full diversity, and obtain a much higher coding gain than other network coding schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.013114.130303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.013114.130303","startPage":"872","endPage":"887","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6777265/06742722.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Adaptive Network Coding for a Non-Orthogonal Multiple-Access Relay Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Power Adaptive Network Coding for a Non-Orthogonal Multiple-Access Relay Channel","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2014","volume":"62","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6742722/","accessionNumber":"14236072","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742722/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Adaptive Network Coding for a Non-Orthogonal Multiple-Access Relay Channel","sourcePdf":"0872-tc1403-wei.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093507S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6777265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6777265","articleId":"6742722","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6742724,"authors":[{"name":"Keke Zu","affiliation":["The University of York, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6777265/6742724/6742724-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Keke Zu received the BSc degree in Communications Engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, China in 2006 and the MSc degree in Communication & Information Systems from National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, China in 2009.

Like SIC detection, the performance of THP strongly depends on the ordering of the precoded symbols. The optimal ordering algorithm, however, is impractical for multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems with multiple receive antennas due to the fact that the users are geographically distributed. In this paper, we propose a multi-branch THP (MB-THP) scheme and algorithms that employ multiple transmit processing and ordering strategies along with a selection scheme to mitigate interference in MU-MIMO systems. Two types of multi-branch THP (MB-THP) structures are proposed. The first one employs a decentralized strategy with diagonal weighted filters at the receivers of the users and the second uses a diagonal weighted filter at the transmitter. The MB-MMSE-THP algorithms are also derived based on an extended system model with the aid of an LQ decomposition, which is much simpler compared to the conventional MMSE-THP algorithms. Simulation results show that a better bit error rate (BER) performance can be achieved by the proposed MB-MMSE-THP precoder with a small computational complexity increase.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.012514.130241","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6777265/06742724.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.012514.130241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777265","startPage":"939","endPage":"951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Branch Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding Design for MU-MIMO Systems: Theory and Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Branch Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding Design for MU-MIMO Systems: Theory and Algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742724/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14236074","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6742724/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Branch Tomlinson-Harashima Precoding Design for MU-MIMO Systems: Theory and Algorithms","sourcePdf":"0939-tc1403-keke.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105786S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6777265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6777265","articleId":"6742724","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6742730,"authors":[{"name":"J.

However, the control strategies for these devices in current clinical use are inadequate as they require separate and sequential control of each degree-of-freedom (DoF). In this study we systematically compare linear and nonlinear regression techniques for an independent, simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control of wrist movements with two DoF. These techniques include linear regression, mixture of linear experts (ME), multilayer-perceptron, and kernel ridge regression (KRR). They are investigated offline with electro-myographic signals acquired from ten able-bodied subjects and one person with congenital upper limb deficiency. The control accuracy is reported as a function of the number of electrodes and the amount and diversity of training data providing guidance for the requirements in clinical practice. The results showed that KRR, a nonparametric statistical learning method, outperformed the other methods. However, simple transformations in the feature space could linearize the problem, so that linear models could achieve similar performance as KRR at much lower computational costs. Especially ME, a physiologically inspired extension of linear regression represents a promising candidate for the next generation of prosthetic devices.","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2305520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/6756986/06742730.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6756986","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2305520","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear and Nonlinear Regression Techniques for Simultaneous and Proportional Myoelectric Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742730","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Linear and Nonlinear Regression Techniques for Simultaneous and Proportional Myoelectric Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742730/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14144598","pubMedId":"24608685","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6742730/","volume":"22","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Linear and Nonlinear Regression Techniques for Simultaneous and Proportional Myoelectric Control","sourcePdf":"tnsre-hahne-2305520-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104728S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"6756986","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"209","xplore-issue":"6756986","articleId":"6742730","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6742731,"authors":[{"name":"Fabi\u00e1n Angarita","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicaciones y Aplicaciones Multimedia, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Gandia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6842725/6742731/6742731-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fabi\u00e1n Angarita received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from the Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia, in 2001, and the M.S. degree in communications technologies, systems and networks and Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering, in 2008 and 2013, respectively, both from the Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia (UPV), Valencia, Spain.","He works as a Research Engineer at the Instituto de Telecomunicaciones y Aplicaciones Multimedia, which belongs to the UPV.

This threatens the security of online operations for enterprises and end users, and consequently affects cloud computing solutions. Although cloud computing provides appealing benefits in terms of costs reduction, while increasing productivity, it introduces uncharted security issues (e.g., see [1]) beyond the ones inherited from the Internet. The emergence of mobile computing also makes authentication a priority, and has been reinforcing the need to build stronger and more resilient mechanisms; and simultaneously providing the means to develop new authentication mechanisms, namely Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) schemes. The convergence to Single Sign-On (SSO) models is being used to eliminate or decrease password management complexity. MFA mostly appears in the form of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) mechanisms based on One-Time Passwords (OTPs) for the second factor after standard password authentication. Such mechanisms can be based on public-key cryptography and may resort to several technologies to improve user experience, namely Quick Response (QR) codes, Short Message Service (SMSes), Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs), or even contactless Near Field Communication (NFC). Another trend leans to the adoption of risk-based authentication. Efforts for securing authentication are mainly being undertaken by the Initiative for Open AuTHentication (OATH) and the Fast IDentity Online (FIDO) alliance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure user authentication in cloud computing management interfaces","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 32nd International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742763","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 32nd International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6733443/6742746/06742763.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742746","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742763/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Secure user authentication in cloud computing management interfaces","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6742763/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14117379","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure user authentication in cloud computing management interfaces","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Poster11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035969S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6733443","isNumber":"6742746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6733443","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6742746","articleId":"6742763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6742781,"authors":[{"name":"Xian Chen","affiliation":["University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Xian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37596813300"},{"name":"Lester Lipsky","affiliation":["University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Lester","lastName":"Lipsky","id":"37274208600"},{"name":"Kyoungwon Suh","affiliation":["Illinois State University"],"firstName":"Kyoungwon","lastName":"Suh","id":"37285499200"},{"name":"Bing Wang","affiliation":["University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086077977"},{"name":"Wei Wei","affiliation":["University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wei","id":"37086382590"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3214-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3213-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-2641"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"}],"articleNumber":"6742781","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742781","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IP networks","Servers","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Smart phones","Analytical models","Data models","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["educational institutions","IP networks","mobile computing","smart phones","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["session length distribution","IP address usage","smartphones","university campus WiFi network","smart mobile handheld devices","MHD","DHCP traces","hyperexponential models"]}],"abstract":"Smart mobile handheld devices (MHDs) are being adopted at a fast speed. Compared to wireless non-handheld devices (NHDs), MHDs tend to be more mobile and can be used more opportunistically. In this paper, we study two important network usage characteristics of MHDs, namely session lengths and IP address usage, in a university campus WiFi network. Specifically, we analyze two five-week long DHCP traces collected from the network, characterize session lengths of MHDs, and develop two hyper-exponential models to capture the distribution of session lengths.We further characterize the IP address usage of MHDs, and develop two analytical models to predict the number of concurrent IP addresses that are being used by MHDs at one point of time. Goodness of fit tests indicate that our analytical models of session lengths provide good fit, and evaluation results demonstrate that the predictions from our models for IP address usage are accurate. Our results provide important insights on managing MHDs as they are being adopted rapidly in WiFi networks.","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742781","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 32nd International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 32nd International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6733443/6742746/06742781.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Session lengths and IP address usage of smartphones in a university campus WiFi network: Characterization and analytical models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Session lengths and IP address usage of smartphones in a university campus WiFi network: Characterization and analytical models","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6742781/","accessionNumber":"14117371","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Session lengths and IP address usage of smartphones in a university campus WiFi network: Characterization and analytical models","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Session404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107334S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6733443","isNumber":"6742746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6733443","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6742746","articleId":"6742781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6742783,"authors":[{"name":"Zhangjie Fu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software & Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhangjie","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085341995"},{"name":"Xingming Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software & Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xingming","lastName":"Sun","id":"37290262300"},{"name":"Zhihua Xia","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software & Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhihua","lastName":"Xia","id":"38100699700"},{"name":"Lu Zhou","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software & Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086632061"},{"name":"Jiangang Shu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Software & Jiangsu Engineering Center of Network Monitoring, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jiangang","lastName":"Shu","id":"37085559869"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3214-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3213-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-2641"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"}],"articleNumber":"6742783","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":562},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Indexes","Servers","Encryption","Frequency modulation","Privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","data privacy","fuzzy set theory","pattern matching","query processing","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multikeyword ranked search supporting synonym query","encrypted data","cloud computing","data privacy","sensitive data","plaintext keyword search technique","searchable encryption schemes","fuzzy keyword search","support semantics-based multikeyword ranked search","cloud customer searching input","predefined keywords","fuzzy matching keywords","synonym substitution","exact knowledge","synonym-based multikeyword ranked search","encrypted cloud data","privacy requirements","threat models","ciphertext model","sensitive frequency information","dummy keywords","security analysis","privacy-preserving guarantee"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","Cloud security","searchable encryption","ranked search","privacy preserving","Synonym extension"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing becomes increasingly popular. To protect data privacy, sensitive data should be encrypted by the data owner before outsourcing, which makes the traditional and efficient plaintext keyword search technique useless. The existing searchable encryption schemes support only exact or fuzzy keyword search, not support semantics-based multi-keyword ranked search. In the real search scenario, it is quite common that cloud customers' searching input might be the synonyms of the predefined keywords, not the exact or fuzzy matching keywords due to the possible synonym substitution (reproduction of information content) and/or her lack of exact knowledge about the data. Therefore, synonym-based multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data remains a very challenging problem. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an effective approach to solve the problem of synonym-based multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data. We make contributions mainly in two aspects: synonym-based search for supporting synonym query and multi-keyword ranked search for achieving more accurate search result. Two secure schemes are proposed to meet privacy requirements in two threat models of known ciphertext model and known background model. In enhanced scheme, the sensitive frequency information can be well protected by introducing some dummy keywords, which is not adopted in basic scheme. We give security analysis to justify the correctness and privacy-preserving guarantee of the proposed schemes. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset validate our analysis and show that our proposed solution is very efficient and effective in supporting synonym-based searching.","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742783","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 32nd International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 32nd International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6733443/6742746/06742783.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742783","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742746","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-keyword ranked search supporting synonym query over encrypted data in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742783","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-keyword ranked search supporting synonym query over encrypted data in cloud computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742783/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14117350","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6742783/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-keyword ranked search supporting synonym query over encrypted data in cloud computing","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Session502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094655S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6733443","isNumber":"6742746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6733443","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6742746","articleId":"6742783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6742784,"authors":[{"name":"Saurabh Dey","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science Dalhousie University, Canada"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Dey","id":"37085398516"},{"name":"Srinivas Sampalli","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science Dalhousie University, Canada"],"firstName":"Srinivas","lastName":"Sampalli","id":"37267937900"},{"name":"Qiang Ye","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science University of PEl, Canada"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Ye","id":"37651252700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3214-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3213-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1097-2641"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2374-9628"}],"articleNumber":"6742784","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":453},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","IEEE Xplore","World Wide Web","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cryptography","data integrity","data privacy","mobile computing","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message digest","authentication entity","mobile cloud computing","World Wide Web","WWW","virtualization technologies","software services","platform services","information-rich databases","security issues","privacy issues","integrity issues","innovative authentication scheme","secure authentication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Mobile Cloud Computing","Authentication","Cloud Vulnerabilities","Message Digest"]}],"abstract":"With the development of the World Wide Web (WWW) and virtualization technologies, cloud computing has started to play a key role in the new computation era. Cloud computing can be used to serve a wide range of applications, from personal to organizational, by means of various infrastructure, software, and platform services. However, the ease of access from terminal devices to powerful processing units and information-rich databases makes the cloud susceptible to a variety of different attacks. The widespread use of cloud computing brings with it a hoard of security, privacy and integrity issues. In this paper, we propose an innovative authentication scheme for mobile cloud computing, MDA. The proposed scheme only uses existing hardware and platforms to prevent most of the potential attacks during the authentication process between a mobile device and the cloud. Technically, the encrypted hashed message (i.e. message digest) is employed by MDA to achieve secure authentication. The performance of MDA is evaluated via protocol simulation and security analysis.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Message digest as authentication entity for mobile cloud computing","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 32nd International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","doi":"10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742784","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 32nd International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6733443/6742746/06742784.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCC.2013.6742784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742746","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Message digest as authentication entity for mobile cloud computing","conferenceDate":"6-8 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6742784/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14117367","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Message digest as authentication entity for mobile cloud computing","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"Session503.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061259S","chronDate":"6-8 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6733443","isNumber":"6742746","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6733443","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6742746","articleId":"6742784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6742811,"authors":[{"name":"Helbert Eduardo Espitia","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia"],"firstName":"Helbert Eduardo","lastName":"Espitia","id":"37704120300"},{"name":"Jorge Iv\u00e1n Sofrony","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering, Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas, Bogot\u00e1, Colombia"],"firstName":"Jorge Iv\u00e1n","lastName":"Sofrony","id":"37299744500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2716-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2715-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6742811","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dispersion","Particle swarm optimization","Optimization","Convergence","Propulsion","Mathematical model","Proposals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dispersion behavior","vortex particle swarm optimization","stopping criterion","vorticity features","VPSO","translational movement","circular movement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bio-inspired optimization","PSO","vortex behavior","stoping criterion","dispersion measurement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742811","abstract":"This paper presents a stopping criterion for the optimization algorithm based on particle swarms with vorticity features: Vortex Particle Swarm Optimization (VPSO).

Since exploration is given by the dispersion process, it is important to have a stop criterion based on swarm dispersion.

However, the efficacy of prefetching significantly degrades in the memory hierarchy using the emerging spin-transfer torque random access memory (STT-RAM) as last-level cache (LLC) due to the long write access latency. In this work, we propose two orthogonal but complimentary techniques to improve the prefetching efficacy of STT-RAM based LLC in chip multi-processor (CMP) systems, namely, request prioritization (RP) and hybrid local-global prefetch control (HLGPC). Simulation results show that by combining these two techniques, we can achieve 6.5%~11% system performance improvement and 4.8%~7.3% LLC energy saving in a quadcore system with a 2MB~8MB STT-RAM based LLC, compared to the system with only basic prefetching.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742868","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742868.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prefetching techniques for STT-RAM based last-level cache in CMP systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prefetching techniques for STT-RAM based last-level cache in CMP systems","conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14127372","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6742868/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prefetching techniques for STT-RAM based last-level cache in CMP systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p671C1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050871S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6742869,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The sign-off performance results show 35% improvement compared to the same 2D design.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Three-dimensional displays","Standards","Libraries","Clocks","Capacitance","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer circuits","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit interconnections","silicon-on-insulator","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3DCoB","monolithic 3D integrated circuit design approach","3DMI technology","very high dense vertical interconnects","3DMI design approach","3D cell-on-buffer","transistor-on-transistor integration","cell-on-cell transistor integration","2D tools","FDSOI technology","benchmark circuits","2D design","size 28 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742870","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742870","startPage":"79","endPage":"84","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742870.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742870/","displayDocTitle":"3DCoB: A new design approach for Monolithic 3D Integrated circuits","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14127413","htmlLink":"/document/6742870/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3DCoB: A new design approach for Monolithic 3D Integrated circuits","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p791C3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058108S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742870","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6742873,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad Abdullah Al","lastName":"Faruque","id":"37085938300"},{"name":"Fereidoun Ahourai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Fereidoun","lastName":"Ahourai","id":"37086709703"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2816-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"6742873","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":801},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742873","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microgrids","Mathematical model","MATLAB","Power system dynamics","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","power system simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-based design","cyber-physical energy systems","CPES","model based design","residential microgrid","cosimulation engine GridMat","MATLAB-Simulink toolbox","GridLAB-D","control algorithms"]}],"abstract":"Cyber-Physical Energy Systems (CPES) are an amalgamation of both power gird technology, and the intelligent communication and co-ordination between the supply and the demand side through distributed embedded computing. Through this combination, CPES are intended to deliver power efficiently, reliably, and economically. The design and development work needed to either implement a new power grid network or upgrade a traditional power grid to a CPES-compliant one is both challenging and time consuming due to the heterogeneous nature of the associated components/subsystems. The Model Based Design (MBD) methodology has been widely seen as a promising solution to address the associated design challenges of creating a CPES. In this paper, we demonstrate a MBD method and its associated tool for the purpose of designing and validating various control algorithms for a residential microgrid. Our presented co-simulation engine GridMat is a MATLAB/Simulink toolbox; the purpose of it is to co-simulate the power systems modeled in GridLAB-D as well as the control algorithms that are modeled in Simulink. We have presented various use cases to demonstrate how different levels of control algorithms may be developed, simulated, debugged, and analyzed by using our GridMat toolbox for a residential mi-crogrid.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742873","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742873.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"104","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model-based design of Cyber-Physical Energy Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A model-based design of Cyber-Physical Energy Systems","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6742873/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14117496","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742873/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model-based design of Cyber-Physical Energy Systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p972S2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061403S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6742889,"authors":[{"name":"Louis K.

Driven by the principle of trading tolerable amounts of application accuracy in return for significant resource savings - the energy consumed, the (critical path) delay and the (silicon) area being the resources - this approach has been limited to certain application domains. In this paper, we propose to expand the application scope, error tolerance as well as the energy savings of inexact computing systems through neural network architectures. Such neural networks are fast emerging as popular candidate accelerators for future heterogeneous multi-core platforms, and have flexible error tolerance limits owing to their ability to be trained. Our results based on simulated 65nm technology designs demonstrate that the proposed inexact neural network accelerator could achieve 43.91%-62.49% savings in energy consumption (with corresponding delay and area savings being 18.79% and 31.44% respectively) when compared to existing baseline neural network implementation, at the cost of an accuracy loss (quantified as the Mean Square Error (MSE) which increases from 0.14 to 0.20 on average).","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742890","endPage":"206","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742890.pdf","startPage":"201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging the error resilience of machine-learning applications for designing highly energy efficient accelerators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742890/","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging the error resilience of machine-learning applications for designing highly energy efficient accelerators","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14127412","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6742890/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging the error resilience of machine-learning applications for designing highly energy efficient accelerators","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p2013A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098781S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6742892,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Mariani","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Mariani","id":"37411715200"},{"name":"Gianluca Palermo","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Palermo","id":"37391879400"},{"name":"Roel Meeuws","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology"],"firstName":"Roel","lastName":"Meeuws","id":"37318247800"},{"name":"Vlad-Mihai Sima","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology"],"firstName":"Vlad-Mihai","lastName":"Sima","id":"37583094300"},{"name":"Cristina Silvano","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano"],"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Silvano","id":"37295776300"},{"name":"Koen Bertels","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology"],"firstName":"Koen","lastName":"Bertels","id":"37284722300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2816-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"6742892","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742892","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Kernel","Expert systems","Radio frequency","Field programmable gate arrays","Acceleration","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","decision support systems","expert systems","field programmable gate arrays","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernel mapping","high level code modifications","PowerPC","Virtex5 FPGA","Xilinx-ml510","reconfigurable platform","expert system","application characteristics learning","heterogeneous computing technologies","application requirements","functionality mapping","functionality coding","heterogeneous platforms","application development","designing reconfigurable architectures with decision-making support","DRuiD"]}],"abstract":"Application development for heterogeneous platforms requires to code and map functionalities on a set of different computing elements.

The framework is composed of an expert system that supports the designer in the mapping decision and gives hints on possible code modifications to be applied to make the functionality more suitable for a computing element. The experimental results are tailored for a heterogeneous and reconfigurable platform (the Xilinx-ml510) including two computational elements, i.e. a Virtex5 FPGA and a PowerPC. The expert system identifies 88.9% of the times what are the functionalities that are accelerated efficiently by using the FPGA, without requiring the kernel porting.

In this paper, for the first time, we present an optimal sample preparation algorithm based on a minimum-cost maximum-flow model. By using the proposed model, we can obtain both the optimal cost of sample and buffer usage and the waste amount even for multiple-target concentrations.

A new formulation of the DMFB droplet routing problem is introduced for the continuous domain, which attempts to minimize total energy consumption while meeting a timing constraint.

Pin-count on a DMFB can be reduced by sharing of control pins between electrodes. Most existing works on reducing pin-count are problem specific. Problem specific optimizations result in DMFB that can only perform certain specific bioassays. Cross-Referencing DMFB has a full array layout that is fully reconfigurable for any bioassay. Conventional Cross-Referencing DMFB uses m + n number of pins. We have devised a non-problem specific pin assignment methodology that uses only \u221a2(\u221am + \u221an) number of pins. The resulting DMFB are still fully reconfigurable. We have developed a droplet router specifically for cross-referencing DMFB with shared control pins.

However, these applications in biochemistry require high precision to avoid erroneous assay outcomes, and therefore are vulnerable to contamination between two fluidic flows with different biochemistries. Moreover, to wash contaminated sites, the buffer solution in flow-based biochips has to be guided along pre-etched channel networks. This constraint makes washing in flow-based microfluidics even harder. In this paper, we propose the first approach for automated wash optimization for contamination removal in flow-based microfluidic biochips. The proposed approach targets the generation of washing pathways to clean all contaminated microchannels with minimum execution time. A path dictionary is first established by pre-searching physically implementable paths in a given chip layout. When wash targets and occupied microchannels are defined, the proposed methods determine an optimized path set with the least washing time by calculating the priorities of wash targets. Two fabricated biochips are used to evaluate the proposed washing method. Compared to an ad hoc baseline method, the proposed approach leads to more efficient washing in all cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742897/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6742897/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14117495","conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wash optimization for cross-contamination removal in flow-based microfluidic biochips","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wash optimization for cross-contamination removal in flow-based microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p2443B4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060538S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6742902,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Shafique","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shafique","id":"37408660000"},{"name":"J\u00f6rg Henkel","affiliation":["Chair for Embedded Systems (CES), Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00f6rg","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37277243700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2816-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"6742902","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":536},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tiles","Memory management","Encoding","Video coding","Interpolation","Hardware","Video sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimedia communication","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power design","next-generation high efficiency video coding standard","computational complexity analysis","power consumption","temperature","memory access behavior","power-efficient HEVC-based multimedia system","low-power algorithmic technique","low-power architectural technique","application-specific knowledge","video content characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["low power design","power management","HEVC","video coding","architecture","algorithm","video memory","hardware accelerator","energy efficiency","analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742902","abstract":"This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity, power consumption, temperature, and memory access behavior for the next-generation High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard.

Next, we discuss parallelization of operations, threads with High Level Synthesis for FPGA and software compiler for processors. The main advantage of the former method is it is able to parallelize operations beyond control dependencies while the latter method has to obey control dependencies.

The target network topology is a variant Mesh-of-Trees (MoT), combining a binary fan-out (i.e. routing) network and a binary fan-in (i.e. arbitration) network, which is becoming widely used for multi-core shared-memory interfaces. The two key features are: (i) each fan-in node can resolve its arbitration and pre-allocate the corresponding input channel, before the actual data arrives; and (ii) a lightweight shadow monitoring network fast forwards information as soon as data enters the network without synchronization to a fixed-rate clock, notifying each fan-in node on its path to enable the early arbitration. Simulations of the new arbitration node, using IBM 90nm technology and an ARM standard cell library, indicate latency reductions up to 54.4% over prior designs, while maintaining roughly comparable throughput. Network-level simulations were then performed on eight diverse synthetic benchmarks, comparing the new approach (\"early arbitration\") with two earlier alternative asynchronous MoT networks (\"baseline\" and \"predictive\"), using a mix of random and deterministic traffic. Considerable improvements in system latency were obtained on all benchmarks, ranging from 13.0% to 38.7%, with especially strong benefits for the two most adversarial benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742911","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742911.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-latency asynchronous interconnection network with early arbitration resolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A low-latency asynchronous interconnection network with early arbitration resolution","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6742911/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14117434","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742911/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-latency asynchronous interconnection network with early arbitration resolution","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p3294B2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090764S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6742914,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Fattah","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Fattah","id":"37541714300"},{"name":"Pasi Liljeberg","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Pasi","lastName":"Liljeberg","id":"37320771000"},{"name":"Juha Plosila","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Juha","lastName":"Plosila","id":"37282178600"},{"name":"Hannu Tenhunen","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Hannu","lastName":"Tenhunen","id":"37273474300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2816-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"6742914","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Throughput","Dispersion","Measurement","Program processors","Power dissipation","Energy dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["run-time task allocation","adjustable contiguity","run-time mapping algorithm","CASqA","allocated processor contiguousness","power dissipation","noncontiguous allocation","network costs","energy saving","network on chip"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Processor allocation","Application Mapping","Dynamic Many-Core Systems","Contiguous Task Mapping"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adjustable contiguity of run-time task allocation in networked many-core systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742914","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742914","startPage":"349","endPage":"354","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742914.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a run-time mapping algorithm, CASqA, for networked many-core systems. In this algorithm, the level of contiguousness of the allocated processors (\u03b1) can be adjusted in a fine-grained fashion. A strictly contiguous allocation (\u03b1 = 0) decreases the latency and power dissipation of the network and improves the applications execution time. However, it limits the achievable throughput and increases the turnaround time of the applications. As a result, recent works consider non-contiguous allocation (\u03b1 = 1) to improve the throughput traded off against applications execution time and network metrics. In contradiction, our experiments show that a higher throughput (by 3%) with improved network performance can be achieved when using intermediate \u03b1 values. More precisely, up to 35% drop in the network costs can be gained by adjusting the level of contiguity compared to non-contiguous cases, while the achieved throughput is kept constant. Moreover, CASqA provides at least 32% energy saving in the network compared to other works.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742914/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6742914/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14127361","conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Adjustable contiguity of run-time task allocation in networked many-core systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adjustable contiguity of run-time task allocation in networked many-core systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p3494B5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049013S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6742916,"authors":[{"name":"Boxun Li","affiliation":["Dept. of E.

Users have to first work out the parameters of memristors through digital computing systems and then tune the memristor to the corresponding state. In this work, we introduce a mixed-signal training acceleration framework, which realizes the self-training of memristor-based neural network. We first modify the original stochastic gradient descent algorithm by approximating calculations and designing an alternative computing method. We then propose a mixed-signal acceleration architecture for the modified training algorithm by equipping the original memristor-based neural network architecture with the copy crossbar technique, weight update units, sign calculation units and other assistant units. The experiment on the MNIST database demonstrates that the proposed mixed-signal acceleration is 3 orders of magnitude faster and 4 orders of magnitude more energy efficient than the CPU implementation counterpart at the cost of a slight decrease of the recognition accuracy (<; 5%).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742916/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6742916/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14117477","conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Training itself: Mixed-signal training acceleration for memristor-based neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training itself: Mixed-signal training acceleration for memristor-based neural network","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p3614C2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071529S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6742917,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Zhu","affiliation":["IMETU and TNList, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37072334100"},{"name":"Zhenyu Liu","affiliation":["IMETU and TNList, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37289199400"},{"name":"Dongsheng Wang","affiliation":["IMETU and TNList, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Dongsheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085460419"},{"name":"Qingrui Han","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Qingrui","lastName":"Han","id":"37086651570"},{"name":"Yang Song","affiliation":["Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Song","id":"37293363900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2816-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"6742917","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":704},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Quantization (signal)","Estimation","Engines","Image edge detection","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high definition television","image texture","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high efficiency video coding","TSMC technology","hardwired encoder","RDO processing","image texture","RD-cost","HEVC intraencoder","HDTV1080p","source texture based CU-PU mode predecision","frequency 357 MHz"]}],"abstract":"HEVC doubles the coding efficiency with more than 4x coding complexity as compared to H.264/AVC.

The maximum power point tracking is conventionally performed by an MPPT charger that stores in the energy storage element, and a voltage regulator (typically a DC-DC converter) produces a proper voltage level for the microprocessor. The energy storage element is an energy buffer and makes it possible to perform MPPT of the PV cells and power management of the microprocessor independently. However, the energy storage element, MPPT charger and DC-DC converter cause seriously limited lifetime (when a typical battery is adopted), significant energy loss (typically over 20%), increased weight/volume and high cost, etc. The proposed method enables extremely fine-grain dynamic power management (DPM) in every a few hundred microseconds and performs the MPPT without using an MPPT charger and a DC-DC converter as well as an energy storage element. We achieve 84.5% of energy harvesting efficiency using the proposed setup with huge reduction in cost, weight and volume, and extended lifetime, which is not even numerically comparable with conventional MPPT methods.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742919","endPage":"384","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742919.pdf","startPage":"379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Storage-less and converter-less maximum power point tracking of photovoltaic cells for a nonvolatile microprocessor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742919/","displayDocTitle":"Storage-less and converter-less maximum power point tracking of photovoltaic cells for a nonvolatile microprocessor","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14117494","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6742919/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Storage-less and converter-less maximum power point tracking of photovoltaic cells for a nonvolatile microprocessor","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p3794C5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06235S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6742923,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Ma","affiliation":["School of Computer and Control Engineering, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086086729"},{"name":"Guihai Yan","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beiiing, China"],"firstName":"Guihai","lastName":"Yan","id":"37532486900"},{"name":"Yinhe Han","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beiiing, China"],"firstName":"Yinhe","lastName":"Han","id":"37280848500"},{"name":"Xiaowei Li","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beiiing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Li","id":"37280862300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2816-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"6742923","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742923","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Hardware","Instruction sets","Computational modeling","Multithreading","Mathematical model","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","multiprocessing systems","multi-threading","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Amphisbaena","heterogeneous many-cores","energy efficiency","thread-level parallelism","core heterogeneity","orthogonal function","multithreading","core mapping strategy","heuristic scheduling algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Heterogeneous many-cores can deliver high performance or energy efficiency. There are two orthogonal ways to improve performance: 1) scale-out by exploiting thread-level parallelism, and 2) scale-up by enabling core heterogeneity. Predicting the performance of such architecture is increasingly challenging. We propose a comprehensive performance model Amphisbaena, or \u03a6, built from two orthogonal functions \u03b1 and \u03b2. Function \u03b1 describes the scale-out speedup and function \u03b2 handles the scale-up speedup. The \u03a6 model can clearly tell not only the overall speedup of a given multithreading and core mapping strategy, but also how to improve the multithreading and core mapping, hence should be a promising performance predictor for future heterogenous many-cores. The results show that \u03a6 model's error rate is within 12%, which is lower than state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the application of \u03a6 model by introducing a heuristic scheduling algorithm, which outperforms the baselines by 13% on average.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742923","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742923.pdf","startPage":"394","endPage":"399","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amphisbaena: Modeling two orthogonal ways to hunt on heterogeneous many-cores","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Amphisbaena: Modeling two orthogonal ways to hunt on heterogeneous many-cores","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6742923/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14117482","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742923/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amphisbaena: Modeling two orthogonal ways to hunt on heterogeneous many-cores","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p3945A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066261S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6742924,"authors":[{"name":"Tomoyuki Nakabayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Mie University, Tsu, Mie, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoyuki","lastName":"Nakabayashi","id":"38499789300"},{"name":"Tomoyuki Sugiyama","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Mie University, Tsu, Mie, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoyuki","lastName":"Sugiyama","id":"37086711275"},{"name":"Takahiro Sasaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Mie University, Tsu, Mie, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Sasaki","id":"37855879900"},{"name":"Eric Rotenberg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Rotenberg","id":"37299890400"},{"name":"Toshio Kondo","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Mie University, Tsu, Mie, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshio","lastName":"Kondo","id":"37441824400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2816-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"6742924","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Emulation","Logic gates","Benchmark testing","Transistors","Hardware","Registers","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","cache storage","integrated circuit design","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["streamlining microprocessor development","standard ASIC design flow","processor co-simulation framework","RTL simulation","gate-transistor level simulation","chip evaluation","LSI tester","off-chip system call emulation mechanism","processor design","RTL design","chip fabrication","checkpoint mechanism","pre-created checkpoint","nondeterministic problem","multicore processor","cache warming mechanism"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a practical processor co-simulation framework for not only RTL simulation but also gate/transistor level simulation, and even chip evaluation with an LSI tester.

The most challenging task is how to accurately estimate the extremely small failure probability of memory circuits where the circuit failure is a \u201crare event\u201d. Classic importance sampling has been widely recognized to be inaccurate and unreliable in high dimensions. To address this issue, we propose a fast statistical analysis to estimate the probability of rare events in high dimensions and prove that the estimation is always bounded. This methodology has been successfully applied to the failure analysis of memory circuits with hundreds of variables, which was considered to be very intractable before. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that successfully solves high dimensional \u201crare event\u201d problems without using expensive Monte Carlo and classic importance sampling methods. Experiments on a 54-dimensional SRAM cell circuit show that the proposed approach achieves 1150x speedup over Monte Carlo without compromising any accuracy. It also outperforms the classification based method (e.g., Statistical Blockade) by 204x and existing importance sampling method (e.g., Spherical Sampling) by 5x.

In this paper, we present a novel non-Monte-Carlo (MC) performance bound analysis technique in time domain. The new method consists of several steps. First the symbolic transient modified nodal analysis (MNA) formulation of the circuit matrices of (linearized) analog and interconnect circuits at a time step is formed. Then the closed-form expressions of the interested performance in terms of variational parameters of the circuit matrices of (linearized) analog and interconnect circuits are derived via a graph-based symbolic analysis method. Then time-domain performance response bound of current time step are obtained by a nonlinear constrained optimization process subject to the parameter variations and variational circuit state bounds computed from the previous time step. We study the bounds computed by the proposed against the different sigma bounds by the standard MC method, which shows that the proposed method is more efficient for computing high sigma bounds than the MC method. Experimental results show that the new method can deliver order of magnitudes speedup over the standard Monte Carlo simulation on some typical analog circuits and interconnect circuits with high accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742933/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14127384","htmlLink":"/document/6742933/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Time-domain performance bound analysis for analog and interconnect circuits considering process variations","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-domain performance bound analysis for analog and interconnect circuits considering process variations","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p4555C3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068695S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742933","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6742934,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Song","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Song","id":"38240831200"},{"name":"Manoj P D Sai","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Manoj P D","lastName":"Sai"},{"name":"Hao Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Yu","id":"37275013000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2816-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"6742934","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Random access memory","Safety","Stability analysis","Transistors","Reachability analysis","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","reachability analysis","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte-Carlo method","traditional verification method","SPICE-like simulator","sequential robustness optimizations","SRAM device parameters","safety distance","sensitivity calculation","backward Euler method","zonotope-based reachability analysis","sensitivity-based reachability analysis","SRAM dynamic stability"]}],"abstract":"A robustness optimization of SRAM dynamic stability at nano-scale is developed in this paper by zonotope-based reachability analysis.

As such, sequential robustness optimizations can be performed such that the optimized SRAM designs can depart from unsafe region but converge into safe region. The proposed method is implemented inside a SPICE-like simulator.

The proposed research is motivated by the observation that many of the in-field failures are delay failures and several variability signatures are also delay-related. The origins of temporal delay fluctuations include manufacturing variability, voltage/temperature changes, negative or positive bias temperature instability-related Vth degradation, etc. Since the actual delay changes depend on process variations as well as workload, on-chip monitoring may be the best way of predicting them. There is a need to monitor circuit performance during manufacturing as well as at runtime to predict achievable performance and warn against impending failures. Adaptive mechanisms in hardware and/or software can optimize the trade-off between errors, energy and performance based on the feedback from runtime circuit performance monitors. This paper presents approaches for automated synthesis of design-dependent performance monitors. These monitors can be used to predict impending delay failures relatively inexpensively. For low-overhead monitoring, we propose multiple design-dependent ring oscillators (DDROs) as smart canary structures which can reliably predict achievable chip frequency but with margins for local variations. Early silicon results indicate that DDROs can reduce delay monitoring error by 35% compared to conventional ring oscillators. To further improve the prediction (albeit at a higher overhead), we propose in-situ slack monitors (SlackProbe) which can match local variations as well at overheads much smaller than monitoring all sequential elements. SlackProbe reduces the number of monitors required by over 15X with 5% additional delay margin in several commercial processor benchmarks. Finally, we show an example of software testbed that demonstrates a variability-aware system that utilizes the hardware monitors and operates with both hardware and software adaptation.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742935","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742935.pdf","startPage":"467","endPage":"473","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate and inexpensive performance monitoring for variability-aware systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742935/","displayDocTitle":"Accurate and inexpensive performance monitoring for variability-aware systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14117485","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6742935/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate and inexpensive performance monitoring for variability-aware systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p4676S1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067667S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6742937,"authors":[{"name":"David Lin","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Lin","id":"38000348600"},{"name":"Subhasish Mitra","affiliation":["Depts. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Subhasish","lastName":"Mitra","id":"37276204700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2816-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"6742937","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":488},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer bugs","System-on-chip","Hardware","Design automation","Computers","Multicore processing","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QED post-silicon validation","debug","integrated circuits","IC","multicore SoC","quick error detection","industrial reports","design flaws"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Debug","Post-Silicon Validation","Quick Error Detection","Verification"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QED post-silicon validation and debug: Frequently asked questions","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","endPage":"482","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742937.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742937","startPage":"478","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742937","abstract":"During post-silicon validation and debug, one or more manufactured integrated circuits (ICs) are tested in actual system environments to detect and fix design flaws (bugs).

In this paper, we propose an automatic synthesis approach for quantum circuits that implement Clifford Group operations. These circuits are essential for many quantum applications and cover core aspects of quantum functionality. The proposed approach exploits specific properties of the unitary transformation matrices that are associated to quantum operations.

But in order to keep up with recent physical developments in this domain, new technological constraints have to be considered. Limited interaction distance between gate qubits is one of the most common of these constraints. This led to the development of several strategies aiming at making a given quantum circuit nearest neighbor-compliant by inserting SWAP gates into the existing structure. Usually these strategies are of heuristic nature. In this work, we present an exact approach that enables nearest neighbor-compliance by inserting a minimal number of SWAP gates. Experiments demonstrate the applicability of the approach which enabled a comparison of results obtained by heuristic methods to the actual optimum.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742939","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742939.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal SWAP gate insertion for nearest neighbor quantum circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742939/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal SWAP gate insertion for nearest neighbor quantum circuits","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14127399","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6742939/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal SWAP gate insertion for nearest neighbor quantum circuits","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p4896A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133282S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6742940,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Shafaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Shafaei","id":"37594635400"},{"name":"Mehdi Saeedi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Saeedi","id":"37395918800"},{"name":"Massoud Pedram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA"],"firstName":"Massoud","lastName":"Pedram","id":"37278158100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2816-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"6742940","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":495},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742940","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Computer architecture","Quantum computing","Optimization","Very large scale integration","Linear programming","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","integer programming","quantum gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication overhead minimization","2D quantum architectures","regular local-neighbor topology","quantum circuit latency","qubit-to-qubit interactions","2D grid architectures","mixed integer programming","MIP formulation","qubit placement problem"]}],"abstract":"Regular, local-neighbor topologies of quantum architectures restrict interactions to adjacent qubits, which in turn increases the latency of quantum circuits mapped to these architectures.

In a typical design flow, a netlist of LUTs formed after technology mapping has to be merged into ALMs and then packed into coarse-grained logic blocks (CLBs) before placement and routing. How the LUTs are merged and the ALMs are packed has a significant impact on the quality of the placement. We propose a novel wirelength-driven algorithm to merge the LUTs and pack the ALMs to ensure that it will not adversely affect the final wire-length. Experimental results show that substituting AAPack [8] by our algorithm yields about 14.54% reduction in number of tracks required for routing and 17.97% wirelength improvement for ALM-based FPGA. Applying our algorithm to traditional FPGA, the minimum channel width and wirelength are reduced by 16.59% and 17.57%, respectively, compared to T-VPack.","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742941.pdf","startPage":"501","endPage":"506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel wirelength-driven packing algorithm for FPGAs with adaptive logic modules","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742941","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742941","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742941/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A novel wirelength-driven packing algorithm for FPGAs with adaptive logic modules","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14127380","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6742941/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel wirelength-driven packing algorithm for FPGAs with adaptive logic modules","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p5016A4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079688S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742941","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6742950,"authors":[{"name":"Anders Lansner","affiliation":["Dept. of Computational Biology, Stockholm university and CSC, KTH, Sweden"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Lansner","id":"38109139700"},{"name":"Ahmed Hemani","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Systems, School of ICT, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Hemani","id":"37265609900"},{"name":"Nasim Farahini","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Systems, School of ICT, Sweden"],"firstName":"Nasim","lastName":"Farahini","id":"37061088000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2816-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"6742950","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spiking brain models: Computation, memory and communication constraints for custom hardware implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742950","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Computational modeling","Brain models","Memory management","Mathematical model","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","bioelectric phenomena","biology computing","brain models","computational complexity","neural nets","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spiking brain model computation constraints","spiking brain model memory constraints","spiking brain model communication constraints","custom hardware implementation","human neural information processing","problem complexity","BCPNN model","Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network"]}],"abstract":"We estimate the computational capacity required to simulate in real time the neural information processing in the human brain.

The design of these artificial nervous systems involves both the development of neuromorphic hardware devices and the development neuromorphic simulation tools. In this paper, we describe a simulation environment that can be used to design, construct, and run spiking neural networks (SNNs) quickly and efficiently using graphics processing units (GPUs). We then explain how the design of the simulation environment utilizes the parallel processing power of GPUs to simulate large-scale SNNs and describe recent modeling experiments performed using the simulator. Finally, we present an automated parameter tuning framework that utilizes the simulation environment and evolutionary algorithms to tune SNNs. We believe the simulation environment and associated parameter tuning framework presented here can accelerate the development of neuromorphic software and hardware applications by making the design, construction, and tuning of SNNs an easier task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14127385","htmlLink":"/document/6742952/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"GPGPU accelerated simulation and parameter tuning for neuromorphic applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPGPU accelerated simulation and parameter tuning for neuromorphic applications","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p5707S3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.171227S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6742953,"authors":[{"name":"Nasim Farahini","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Systems, School of ICT, KTH, Sweden"],"firstName":"Nasim","lastName":"Farahini","id":"37061088000"},{"name":"Ahmed Hemani","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Systems, School of ICT, KTH, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Hemani","id":"37265609900"},{"name":"Anders Lansner","affiliation":["Dept. of Computational Biology, School of CSC, KTH, Sweden"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Lansner","id":"38109139700"},{"name":"Fabian Clermidy","affiliation":["Digital design and Architecture Lab, Cea-Leti, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Fabian","lastName":"Clermidy","id":"37086667344"},{"name":"Christer Svensson","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University"],"firstName":"Christer","lastName":"Svensson","id":"37268566200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2816-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"6742953","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A scalable custom simulation machine for the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network model of the brain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742953","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Random access memory","Brain modeling","Computational modeling","Three-dimensional displays","Delays","Aggregates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["belief networks","biomedical electronics","brain","DRAM chips","mainframes","medical computing","neural chips","neurophysiology","parallel machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable custom simulation machine","Bayesian confidence propagation neural network model","multichip custom digital supercomputer","human brain","hybrid memory cube","3D stacked DRAM memories","synaptic weights","custom designed logic chip","BCPNN model","eBrain","general purpose supercomputers","technology node"]}],"abstract":"A multi-chip custom digital super-computer called eBrain for simulating Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) model of the human brain has been proposed.

In this work, we propose Data Pattern Aware (DPA) error protection technique to extend the lifespan of NAND flash based storage systems (NFSS). DPA manipulates the ratio of 1's and 0's in the stored data to minimize occurrence of the data patterns which are susceptible to bit error noise. Consequently, the NAND flash cell bit error rate is reduced, leading to system endurance extension. Our simulation result shows that, with marginal hardware and power overhead, DPA scheme can increase the NFSS lifetime by up to 4\u00d7, offering a complementing solution to other lifetime enhancement techniques like wear-leveling.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742955","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742955","startPage":"592","endPage":"597","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742955.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DPA: A data pattern aware error prevention technique for NAND flash lifetime extension","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742955/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"DPA: A data pattern aware error prevention technique for NAND flash lifetime extension","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14117471","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6742955/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DPA: A data pattern aware error prevention technique for NAND flash lifetime extension","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p5927A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067868S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6742957,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Yen Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University"],"firstName":"Chih-Yen","lastName":"Lai","id":"37086780254"},{"name":"Gung-Yu Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University"],"firstName":"Gung-Yu","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085490150"},{"name":"Hsien-Kai Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University"],"firstName":"Hsien-Kai","lastName":"Kuo","id":"38059767000"},{"name":"Jing-Yang Jou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University"],"firstName":"Jing-Yang","lastName":"Jou","id":"37274764900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2816-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"6742957","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Delays","System performance","Power demand","Degradation","Benchmark testing","Program processors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","multiprocessing systems","power consumption","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power efficiency","multicore systems","modern multicore architectures","DRAM scheduling","read-write reordering","read-write aware throttling"]}],"abstract":"The demand of high performance and low power has increased the importance of power efficiency in multi-core systems. In modern multi-core architectures, DRAM has dominated the power consumption and therefore reordering based DRAM scheduling has been intensively studied to reduce the power. However, the benefit of reordering is not fully explored by the previous studies. To further reduce the power, this paper proposes the read-write reordering and the read-write aware throttling.

At the same time FPGAs are reaching capacities that allow entire systems to be implemented on them. Most of these systems are also DSP-related and make intensive use of the FPGAs' embedded hardmacros (e.g. DSP-blocks). This works presents a method to efficiently allocate DSP-macros in multi-process systems created using HLS in order to minimize the overall area. The proposed method calculates the area sensitivity of each process when its multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations are either mapped onto the FPGA's hardmacro or its configurable resources and allocates the available hardmacros across all processes. Experimental results show that our method creates very good results compared to the optimal solution at a negligible running time.","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742959.pdf","startPage":"616","endPage":"621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Allocation of FPGA DSP-macros in multi-process high-level synthesis systems","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742959","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Allocation of FPGA DSP-macros in multi-process high-level synthesis systems","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14127335","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6742959/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Allocation of FPGA DSP-macros in multi-process high-level synthesis systems","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p6167B1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049738S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6742969,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Kang","affiliation":["Electronics and information engineering, Univ.

Especially the split of read and write paths in SOT-MRAM promises faster access times and lower energy consumption compared to STT-MRAM. In this work, we provide a very detailed analysis of SOT-MRAM at both circuit- and architecture-level. We present a detailed evaluation of performance and energy related parameters and compare the novel SOT-MRAM with several other memory technologies. Our architecture-level analysis shows that with a hybrid-combination of SRAM for the L1-cache and SOT-MRAM for the L2-cache the energy consumption can be reduced by 63 % in average while the performance can be increased by 1 %. In addition, the memory area is 43% lower compared to an SRAM-only configuration.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742972","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742972.pdf","startPage":"700","endPage":"707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architectural aspects in design and analysis of SOT-based memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Architectural aspects in design and analysis of SOT-based memories","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14127403","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6742972/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742972/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectural aspects in design and analysis of SOT-based memories","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p7008S4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119013S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6742973,"authors":[{"name":"Hardik Shah","affiliation":["Department of Informatics VI, Technical University Munich, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Hardik","lastName":"Shah","id":"38058064500"},{"name":"Kai Huang","affiliation":["Department of Informatics VI, Technical University Munich, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Huang","id":"37534912900"},{"name":"Alois Knoll","affiliation":["Department of Informatics VI, Technical University Munich, Garching, Germany"],"firstName":"Alois","lastName":"Knoll","id":"37276234100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2816-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-6961"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-697X"}],"articleNumber":"6742973","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Timing","Equations","Computational modeling","Radiation detectors","Round robin","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","interference","microprocessor chips","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing anomalies","interference analysis","shared resources","M\u0308alardalen WCET benchmark suit","NIOS II multicore architecture","Altera FPGA","timed automata models"]}],"abstract":"Timing anomalies in single-core processors have been theoretically explained and well understood phenomenon.

Recently proposed 3D vertical cross-point ReRAM (3D-VRAM) architecture attracts a lot of attention because it offers a cost-competitive solution as NAND Flash replacement. In this work, we first develop an array-level model which includes the geometries and properties of all the components in the 3D structure. The model is capable of analyzing the read/write noise margin of a 3D-VRAM array in the presence of the sneak leakage current and voltage drop. Then we build a system-level design tool that is able to explore the design space with specified constraints and find the optimal design points with different targets. We also study the impact of different design parameters on the array size, bit density, and overall cost-per-bit. Compared to the state-of-the-art 3D horizontal ReRAM (3D-HRAM), the 3D-VRAM shows great cost advantage when stacking more than 16 layers.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

However, different from conventional 2D spiral inductors, TSV inductors are fully buried in the lossy substrate, thus suffering from low quality factor. In this paper, we propose a novel shield mechanism utilizing the micro-channel, a technique conventionally used for heat removal, to reduce the substrate loss. This technique increases the quality factor and the inductance of the TSV inductor by up to 21x and 17x respectively. It enables us to implement TSV inductors of up to 38x smaller area and 33% higher quality factor, compared with spiral inductors of the same inductance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first proposal on improving quality factor of TSV inductors. We hope our study shall point out a new and exciting research direction for 3D IC designers.","doi":"10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742994","publicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736726/6742831/06742994.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASPDAC.2014.6742994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742831","startPage":"837","endPage":"842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Through-silicon-via inductor: Is it real or just a fantasy?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6742994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Through-silicon-via inductor: Is it real or just a fantasy?","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6742994/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14127396","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6742994/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Through-silicon-via inductor: Is it real or just a fantasy?","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"p8379B4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07293S","chronDate":"20-23 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736726","isNumber":"6742831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736726","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6742831","articleId":"6742994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6742997,"authors":[{"name":"Smruti R.

With the Fresnel approximation, the problem of nearfield wideband beamforming can be readily transformed to a corresponding farfield issue, and the well-established farfield design method of CMRBs can be used. To reduce the design complexity of nearfield wideband beamformer under different focal distances, a set of FIR filters are designed to accurately compensate the fractional propagation delay originated from the curvature term. The representative design examples are presented to demonstrate the encouraging beamforming performance under nearfield condition.","doi":"10.1109/ICEMI.2013.6743012","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 11th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731716/6742999/06743012.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMI.2013.6743012","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 11th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","startPage":"170","endPage":"175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient design method of nearfield wideband beamformer for underwater radiated noise measurement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6743012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Efficient design method of nearfield wideband beamformer for underwater radiated noise measurement","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6743012/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6743012/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14127217","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","conferenceDate":"16-19 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient design method of nearfield wideband beamformer for underwater radiated noise measurement","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"ICEMI0048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083127S","chronDate":"16-19 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6731716","isNumber":"6742999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6731716","xplore-issue":"6742999","articleId":"6743012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6743028,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Diessel","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Diessel","id":"37299225700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0759-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0757-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0758-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6743028","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunities and challenges for dynamic FPGA reconfiguration in electronic measurement and instrumentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6743028","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Instruments","Computer bugs","Testing","Integrated circuit modeling","Tunneling magnetoresistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised instrumentation","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexibility","circuit implementation","field-programmable gate arrays","electronic instrumentation","electronic measurement","dynamic FPGA reconfiguration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamically reconfigurable systems","FPGA","modular reconfiguration","simulation","SEU mitigation"]}],"abstract":"Reconfigurable systems based on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can offer performance and power advantages over processor-based systems as well as cost and flexibility advantages over custom integrated circuit solutions.

Currently, the calibration using the standard instrument is the most important means, which severely restricts the test environment of the simulator. In order to meet the test requirements of the GPS signal simulator for diversified situation, this paper proposes a design of the calibration receiver using the direct RF sampling technology and gives the design scheme. Based on the bandpass sampling theorem, the determination method of the sampling frequency for multiband signal is analyzed and the sampling frequency of the calibration receiver is determined. In addition, the range accuacy is the critical factor influencing on the test performance of the calibration receiver, and the sampling noise becomes the main error source for the calibration receiver using the direct RF sampling technology, so the range error caused by the sampling noise is analyzed in detail. The results show that the range error caused by the sampling noise tends to be constant when the CNR is over 85dB-Hz. For L1 P code, L2 P code and L5 P code, the range error generated by the calibration receiver doesn't exceed 5.2 mm, 4.3mm and 4.1mm, respectively, when the CNR of the test signal generated by the GPS simulator is set to 85dB-Hz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6743110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6743110/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14116631","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Choice of sampling frequency for Gps signal simulator calibration receiver and influence on spread-spectrum ranging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Choice of sampling frequency for Gps signal simulator calibration receiver and influence on spread-spectrum ranging","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"S090815.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053048S","chronDate":"16-19 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6731716","isNumber":"6742999","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6731716","xplore-issue":"6742999","articleId":"6743110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6743116,"authors":[{"name":"Li Ying","affiliation":["The State Key Laboratory of Complex Electromagnetic Environmental Effects on Electronics & Information System, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"p":["Li Ying was born in Yongzhou, Hunan, China, in 1977.

In order to eliminate the cross-range resolution degradation when the antenna beam radiates to the burden surface in nonperpendicular angle, MIMO antenna arrays with elliptical cross-section beam are specially designed. To suppress the high side lobe level of these designed MIMO arrays, two MIMO array sparse methods by symmetrically sparse the arrays with denser elements in the centre and sparse elements around are presented and analyzed. Patterns of the designed MIMO arrays are simulated, which verified the effectiveness of the MIMO arrays for burden surface imaging.","doi":"10.1109/ICEMI.2013.6743171","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 11th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 11th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731716/6743112/06743171.pdf","startPage":"895","endPage":"900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMI.2013.6743171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6743112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of 2-D MIMO antenna arrays for high resolution burden surface imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6743171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6743171/","displayDocTitle":"Design of 2-D MIMO antenna arrays for high resolution burden surface imaging","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14116699","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6743171/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of 2-D MIMO antenna arrays for high resolution burden surface imaging","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"S090666.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070148S","chronDate":"16-19 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6731716","isNumber":"6743112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6731716","xplore-issue":"6743112","articleId":"6743171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6743180,"authors":[{"name":"San Ye","affiliation":["Control and Simulation Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"p":["San Ye was born in 1951.

The existing MIMO radar waveform design method is almost design complex, large amount of calculation, it is difficult to produce in large quantities. In order to solve this problem, this paper applies pseudo randomness, sensitivity to initial conditions, easy to produce and other characteristics of continuous chaotic signal(CCFMS), the proposed MIMO radar signal is based on continuous chaotic FM signal. First, CCFMS ambiguity function is deduced, then the distance and Doppler resolution performance of the signal is analyzed. On this basis, the cross correlation is analyzed, and the influence of the different continuous chaos system on the signal performance is compared. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the signal has approximately \"thumbtack type\" ambiguity function, excellent quasi-orthogonal and low interception capabilities, and the signal is easy to generate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 11th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731716/6743112/06743227.pdf","startPage":"781","endPage":"785","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 11th International Conference on Electronic Measurement & Instruments","doi":"10.1109/ICEMI.2013.6743227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEMI.2013.6743227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6743112","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6743227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO radar signal design based on continuous chaos","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","Chaos","Correlation","Signal resolution","Doppler effect","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","correlation theory","CW radar","Doppler radar","FM radar","MIMO radar","radar resolution","random sequences","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-orthogonal","thumbtack type ambiguity function","continuous chaos system","cross correlation","Doppler signal resolution performance","distance performance","CCFMS ambiguity function","continuous chaotic FM signal","pseudo randomness","MIMO radar signal waveform design method","radar waveform orthogonality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","CCFMS","orthogonal","radar"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6743227/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"MIMO radar signal design based on continuous chaos","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6743227/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14116682","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","conferenceDate":"16-19 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO radar signal design based on continuous chaos","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"S090816.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048377S","chronDate":"16-19 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6731716","isNumber":"6743112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6731716","xplore-issue":"6743112","articleId":"6743227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6743241,"authors":[{"name":"Kuojun Yang","affiliation":["UESTC, College of automation engineering, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Kuojun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086745087"},{"name":"Shulin Tian","affiliation":["UESTC, College of automation engineering, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Shulin","lastName":"Tian","id":"37409308100"},{"name":"Jinpeng Song","affiliation":["UESTC, College of automation engineering, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jinpeng","lastName":"Song","id":"37086420547"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2716-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2715-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6743241","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time measurement","Jitter","Measurement uncertainty","Temperature measurement","Distortion measurement","Field programmable gate arrays","Oscilloscopes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","filtering theory","jitter","measurement errors","oscilloscopes","random processes","signal reconstruction","signal sampling","time measurement","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed random equivalent sampling method","time stretch factor analysis","measuring error","jitter","waveform reconstruction","average filter effectiveness","distortion reduction","digital oscilloscope","equivalent sampling rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["equivalent sampling","time stretch","average filter","time measurement"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A high speed random equivalent sampling method based on time-stretch","doi":"10.1109/IMSNA.2013.6743241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742799","endPage":"162","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Symposium on Instrumentation and Measurement, Sensor Network and Automation (IMSNA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Symposium on Instrumentation and Measurement, Sensor Network and Automation (IMSNA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732241/6742799/06743241.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMSNA.2013.6743241","startPage":"159","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6743241","abstract":"Random equivalent sampling is realized based on time stretch in this paper.

The numerical result shows that for vertically stratified ground when the vertical interface is not far away from the lightning channels, the NFDTD has higher precision than the TFDTD within the range of 50m from the lightning channels, and the results using the NFDTD and the TFDTD tend to come together beyond the range. It is shown that the NFDTD presented in this paper has a great advantage over the TFDTD and the NFDTD has a wide applicability in calculating the lightning electromagnetic

But low power and low noise TIAs are still a challenge for the scientists despite of rapid advances in complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. This paper proposes a three-stage nested miller compensated (NMC) based design of low noise low power transimpedance amplifier for stable wideband operation. The circuit is designed in the 0.18\u03bcm CMOS technology by using Mentor Graphics environment. The simulation results show that the proposed TIA can operate at frequency 20 KHz and produces an output of 1.4265V for \u00b11.2 V input voltages dissipating only 2.9206 mW power at 27\u00b0C temperature. The complete layout of the TIA is only 0.005 \u03bcm2. This shunt-feedback TIA can be a better choice for high-resolution, low-to mid frequency applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6743369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-24 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6743369/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14129780","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Shunt-feedback transimpedance amplifier in 0.18\u03bcm CMOS technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shunt-feedback transimpedance amplifier in 0.18\u03bcm CMOS technology","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"APART170IMSNAZEE548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048841S","chronDate":"23-24 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732241","isNumber":"6742799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732241","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6742799","articleId":"6743369","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6743383,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Liang","affiliation":["Wuhan Second Ship Design and Research Institute, Wuhan, Hubei, P.R.

Simulated annealing is the best-known method applied to this problem due to the good quality of result (QoR), but its computation time seems not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a parallel placement algorithm named MPP-SA (Multi-core Parallel Placement algorithm based on Simulated Annealing). Our goal is to provide a fast placement algorithm with high QoR. MPP-SA has the same annealing schedule as the traditional simulated annealing, but it uses the parallel approach to move blocks concurrently by multiple threads that are run on different cores of the same processor. To ensure the correctness of the results, MPP-SA also uses synchronization technology and lock mechanism, which brings some overheads. However, experiment results show that these overheads have not seriously affected the performance of our algorithm, especial for large circuits. Compared with the placement algorithm of T_VPlace in VPR5.0, MPP-SA is able to decrease the run-time of 5 different size benchmark circuits by an average of 32%-42% without losing QoR.","doi":"10.1109/IMSNA.2013.6743419","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMSNA.2013.6743419","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Symposium on Instrumentation and Measurement, Sensor Network and Automation (IMSNA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Symposium on Instrumentation and Measurement, Sensor Network and Automation (IMSNA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732241/6742799/06743419.pdf","startPage":"884","endPage":"889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742799","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6743419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Application of multi-core parallel computing in FPGA placement","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-24 Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14129843","htmlLink":"/document/6743419/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of multi-core parallel computing in FPGA placement","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"APART220IMSNAZEE651.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069541S","chronDate":"23-24 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732241","isNumber":"6742799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732241","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6742799","articleId":"6743419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6743436,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Shanghai Maritime University Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086718474"},{"name":"Hua Bo","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Shanghai Maritime University Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Bo","id":"37561464500"},{"name":"Qiang Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Sun","id":"37086720515"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2716-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2715-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6743436","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"abstract":"Block Compressed Sensing (BCS) is one of the fundamental theories for image reconstruction. Compared with the traditional Compressed Sensing (CS) technique, it reduces the computational complexity and improves the efficiency of the reconstruction. However, the reconstruction quality of BCS is deteriorated to some degree. In order to improve the reconstruction quality of BCS, a new method based on human visual characteristics is proposed following the analysis of the DCT coefficients of an image. In the new method is introduced the contrast sensitivity in Watson visual model, indicating that the human eyes have different sensitivity to different DCT coefficients. To each element of the observation matrix in the same image block is assigned different weights based on visual characteristics. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can not only effectively improve the image reconstruction quality, but also have better subjective visual effect.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Symposium on Instrumentation and Measurement, Sensor Network and Automation (IMSNA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732241/6742799/06743436.pdf","startPage":"951","endPage":"954","publicationTitle":"2013 2nd International Symposium on Instrumentation and Measurement, Sensor Network and Automation (IMSNA)","doi":"10.1109/IMSNA.2013.6743436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMSNA.2013.6743436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6743436","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block compressed sensing based on human visual for image reconstruction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Compressed sensing","Visualization","Discrete cosine transforms","Sensitivity","Sparse matrices","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","computational complexity","discrete cosine transforms","image reconstruction","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block compressed sensing","image reconstruction","BCS","computational complexity","human visual characteristics","DCT coefficients","contrast sensitivity","Watson visual model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block Compressed Sensing","DCT Sparse Coefficient","Watson Visual Model","Contrast Sensitivity","Weighted Observation Matrix"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6743436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-24 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Block compressed sensing based on human visual for image reconstruction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6743436/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14129839","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","conferenceDate":"23-24 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block compressed sensing based on human visual for image reconstruction","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"APART237IMSNAZEE801.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081598S","chronDate":"23-24 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732241","isNumber":"6742799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732241","xplore-issue":"6742799","articleId":"6743436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6743438,"authors":[{"name":"Shasha Meng","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Lab of Mobile Communications, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications(CQUPT), Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Shasha","lastName":"Meng","id":"37086682288"},{"name":"Demin Zhang","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Lab of Mobile Communications, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications(CQUPT), Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Demin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37898265000"},{"name":"Bei Chen","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Lab of Mobile Communications, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications(CQUPT), Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Bei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37078328800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2716-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2715-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6743438","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6743438","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Complexity theory","Signal processing algorithms","Digital signal processing","Algorithm design and analysis","OFDM","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","digital signal processing chips","least mean squares methods","Long Term Evolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSP","LMMSE algorithm","QR decomposition","channel estimation","receiver","TD-LTE system","pilot signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","pilot signal","algorithm","DSP realization"]}],"abstract":"Channel estimation is an important link in the receiver of TD-LTE system, it's accuracy that directly affects the system performance.

The tracking technique and object appearance model play a critical role in the success of a tracker. This work presents a new methodology for object tracking `IS-ObjTrack', which utilizes a computational intelligence based tracking algorithm, employing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. PSO provides robustness and time efficiency. The major advantage of the proposed IS-ObjTrack is the utilization of histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) for the development of an object appearance model. The proposed HOG based appearance model is readily exploited by PSO for fast i.e. real-time object tracking. HOG belongs to the class of gradient based filters, hence shows excellent results for objects with distinguished edges. The appearance model is designed for adaptation, whereby the parameters are updated in this work in an online manner.

It is an under-constraint problem hence a user interaction is required to identify the definite foreground, background and semi-transparent pixels. In general the information in the definite foreground and background regions is modeled locally to estimate the foreground and background color of the pixels in the semi-transparent region which are then used to estimate opacity values. A global non-parametric sampling based approach is presented which incorporates not only the color information in the foreground and background regions but also utilizes the local structure of an image to improve the quality of the estimate matte. This global sampling approach reduces the segmentation mis-classification that is incorporated in the resulting alpha matte by considering only the local color information. The results obtained are comparable to the state of the art image matting techniques on a standard dataset.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Mathematical model","Optimization","Equations","Estimation","Robustness","Wires"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image sampling","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matting techniques","local color information","alpha matte","segmentation misclassification","background color","foreground color","background regions","definite foreground","semitransparent pixels","opacity values","foreground objects","global nonparametric sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alpha matte","Non-parametric","Global sampling method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICET.2013.6743541","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Emerging Technologies (ICET)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Emerging Technologies (ICET)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732147/6743478/06743541.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6743478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICET.2013.6743541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A global non-parametric sampling based image matting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6743541","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A global non-parametric sampling based image matting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6743541/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6743541/","accessionNumber":"14117035","conferenceDate":"9-10 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A global non-parametric sampling based image matting","confLoc":"Islamabad, Pakistan","sourcePdf":"ICET2013Camera274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049187S","chronDate":"9-10 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732147","isNumber":"6743478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732147","xplore-issue":"6743478","articleId":"6743541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6743544,"authors":[{"name":"Kashif Shahzad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, College of Electrical & Mechanical Engineering, NUST, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Kashif","lastName":"Shahzad","id":"37086695770"},{"name":"Azhar Hussain","affiliation":["Department of Modem DSP, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Azhar","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37086723421"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3457-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3456-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6743544","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Spread spectrum communication","Equalizers","Modulation","Fading","Signal to noise ratio","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","fading channels","mobile ad hoc networks","mobile handsets","multipath channels","optimisation","quadrature amplitude modulation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high data rate operation","QAM modulation","multipath fading effects","datapath","word lengths","power tradeoffs","area tradeoffs","mobile consumer devices based communication system","ad hoc settings","WCDMA","wideband code division multiple access","power aware implementation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WCDMA","Low Power","Ad hoc","QAM"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the use of WCDMA techniques in mobile consumer devices based communication system used in ad hoc settings.

Image transposition and generalized sorting of multidimensional arrays are other interesting applications of bit-reversal algorithms. In this paper, we propose an efficient bit-reversal permutation algorithm, namely the swapping algorithm, that has a time complexity of O(\u221an).

Basically, this technique uses a number of past sequential data values and then makes a calculation to yields a value for the next unseen data. The system using this technique requires a prediction model which had to be trained first. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) is widely used as a prediction model for various time series prediction system. The training process of the ANN model is commonly done by using Back Propagation (BP) algorithm. But, there are many other alternative algorithms that can be applied to train the ANN model. One of them is by using an optimization algorithm. Evolution Strategies (ES) is one of the optimization algorithms that can be used as the training algorithm for the ANN prediction model. ES is one of the Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) that has successfully solved many optimization problems. ES is expected to be faster in providing the optimal solution and in determining the optimal weights set for the prediction model. In this research, a prediction system is applied to forecast the order module of SLMA module: COS P / N S3081O-Q815-Xl15. The system is needed in order to predict the number of ordered modules, so that it can be used as consideration in the provision of modules. In the case of this research, it shows that the ES algorithm is able to be the alternative algorithm to train the ANN model in order to gain the optimal weights. It was shown in the training results that BP algorithm yields a bit better than ES algorithm. Meanwhile, in the testing results, the error yielded by the ES algorithm is less than the BP algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6743594/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14117407","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6743594/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","conferenceDate":"25-27 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evolution strategies for weight optimization of Artificial Neural Network in time series prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolution strategies for weight optimization of Artificial Neural Network in time series prediction","confLoc":"Jogjakarta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"ROB13T5A3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052237S","chronDate":"25-27 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6733779","isNumber":"6743559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6733779","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6743559","articleId":"6743594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6743679,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The BER performance of Polar-STBC system is discussed by numerical simulation under different polar code length, different polar code rates, and different coding methods of STBC.

We use the update rule proposed by Gallager in the decoding algorithm of low density parity check (LDPC) codes to replace the node update rules used in successive cancellation (SC) algorithm for polar codes. To simplify the logarithmic and the exponential operations in the Gallager's approach node updates rule for polar codes, we further utilize a piece-wise linear algorithm to approximate the involution transform function, where the piece-wise linear algorithm only uses multiplication and addition operation.

The numerical simulations show that our proposed SC algorithm (Piece-wise approx.) has a lower implementation complexity for polar code decoding, but at the cost about 0.7dB degradation in the bit-error-rate (BER) performance in comparison with the SC algorithm proposed by Arikan when the BER is 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n.

Power allocation (PA) between the local signal and relay signal is crucial for the performance of SMC. An Adaptive Orthogonal Superposition Modulation Cooperation (OSMC) Scheme is designed based on the bit-level Mutual Information (MI) model to minimize the average outage probability of the three-node cooperation system.

Least square method is adopted to determine calibration curves and then get calibration coefficients.

The recently adopted MFB in industrial standards is called Perfect Reconstructed Cosine Modulated Filter-Banks (PR-CMFB). There are three types of structure for its implementation, Extended Lapped Transform (ELT), Lattice structure, and Polyphase structure. The ELT defeats the Polyphase and Lattice structures because it is suitable for Very Large Scale Integrated-Circuit (VLSI) implementation. However, there is no difference in computational complexity between them. This paper optimizes the ELT structure to bring out its potential in the VLSI implementation. The proposed ELT reduces the required number of multipliers by half. The implementation on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is done to approve that. The simulation results show the proposed ELT has doubled throughput and one thirds of logic elements (LEs) are reserved when comparing to the conventional ELT.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2013.6743916","publicationTitle":"2013 6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731781/6743849/06743916.pdf","startPage":"1520","endPage":"1524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2013.6743916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6743849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized extended lapped transform and novel FPGA implementation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6743916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xploreNote":"Please be advised that the paper you have accessed is a draft of the final paper that was presented at the conference.

CBFM generates sets of high-level basis functions, i.e. the characteristic basis function (CBF), defined over macro domains of the object under discussion, to significantly reduce the matrix size and storage and make the reduced linear system easily manageable and solvable. In the conventional fulfillment, to generate the CBF, a series of matrix equations need to be solved repeatedly with various excitations of multiple incident angles and different polarizations. With the help of CS, much fewer excitations are necessary to solve the matrix equations, and one can obtain the measurements of the induced currents accordingly. Finally, the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) method is used to reconstruct the real induced currents and from which the CBF is generated. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2013.6743938","publicationTitle":"2013 6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731781/6743849/06743938.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2013.6743938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6743849","startPage":"1633","endPage":"1637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing electromagnetic scattering using characteristic basis function method with compressed sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6743938","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing electromagnetic scattering using characteristic basis function method with compressed sensing","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xploreNote":"Please be advised that the paper you have accessed is a draft of the final paper that was presented at the conference.

Over time, however, the existing data sets used for evaluation of a HIDS have lost most of their relevance due to the substantial development of computer systems. To fill this gap, ADFA Linux data set (ADFA-LD) is recently released, which is composed of thousands of system call traces collected from a contemporary Linux local server and expects to be a new benchmark for evaluating a HIDS. In this paper, we perform a preliminary analysis of ADFA-LD, in an attempt to extract useful information for developing new host-based anomaly detection systems (HADSs). In accordance with the general concerns arising from the community, some typical features are analysed particularly against ADFA-LD, such as length, common pattern and frequency. Furthermore, we implement a simple k nearest neighbour (kNN)-based HADS to be evaluated using ADFA-LD. The experimental results show that, although an acceptable performance can be acquired for a few types of attack, there is still a long way to fully understand the complex behaviour resulting from a modern computer system and, finally, realise more intelligent HADSs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating host-based anomaly detection systems: A preliminary analysis of ADFA-LD","publicationTitle":"2013 6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2013.6743952","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731781/6743849/06743952.pdf","startPage":"1711","endPage":"1716","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2013.6743952","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6743849","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6743952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6743952/","xploreNote":"Please be advised that the paper you have accessed is a draft of the final paper that was presented at the conference.

However, there is a weak anomaly detection problem among the existing system call based intrusion detection systems: the pattern value range of abnormal system call sequences generated by attacks always overlaps to that by normal behaviors so it is difficult to accurately classify the sequences falling into the overlap area by a unique threshold. Instead of using fuzzy inference, we innovatively solve this problem by proposing a top-k prediction based multi-module (abbreviated as TkPMM) anomaly detection system to enlarge patterns of sequences falling into the overlap area and make them more classifiable. We further develop a scalable linear algorithm called top-k variation of the Viterbi algorithm (called TkVV algorithm) to efficiently predict the top-k most probable future system call sequences. Extensive experimental studies show that TkPMM greatly enhances the intrusion detection accuracy of the existing intrusion detection system by up to 25% in terms of hit rates under small false alarm rate bounds and the complexity of our TkVV algorithm is exponential better than that of the baseline method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731781/6743849/06743958.pdf","startPage":"1748","endPage":"1753","publicationTitle":"2013 6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2013.6743958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2013.6743958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6743849","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6743958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Top-k future system call prediction based multi-module anomaly detection system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Prediction algorithms","Predictive models","Markov processes","Training","Accuracy","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["top-k future system call prediction","multimodule anomaly detection system","computer networks","system protection","system call based intrusion detection systems","abnormal system call sequences","sequence classification","top-k prediction based multimodule","scalable linear algorithm","top-k variation","Viterbi algorithm","TkVV algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Top-k Prediction","Multi-module System","Intrusion Detection","Viterbi Algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6743958/","xploreNote":"Please be advised that the paper you have accessed is a draft of the final paper that was presented at the conference.

A major challenge in CS is its quality improvement of recovered signal when noise exists. To reduce noise in the recovered images, filters are usually employed.

Considering desirability of the block-based recovery in practical usages, the proposed hybrid filter is investigated not only for the frame-based recovery but also for the block-based recovery.

For DWT, high-performance line-based lifting implementation supporting both 5/3 reversible and 9/7 irreversible filters is used to gain higher computational accuracy under lower hardware overhead constraints. For the block encoder, the bitplane parallel EBCOT architecture and efficient MQ coder scheme are adopted to increase parallelism and hardware utility.

First, edges are determined by integrating the grayscale changes of the image window and calculating the maximal eigenvalue of the result matrix. Then the eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector are used to model the grayscale distribution inside the edge pixel. The adaptive weights are determined both by the Euclidean distance of the interpolation position to the neighboring pixels and the edge strength of the neighboring pixels, where smooth pixels are given larger weights. Finally, the interpolated pixel value is obtained by weighted linear summation of the neighborhood pixels.

Emerging safety standards will soon require PV system to include arc fault detection equipment. Arc faults can cause fires, shock hazard, and system failure. Existing techniques that rely on pattern recognition in the time domain, or amplitude detection in the frequency domain by using a Fourier Transform, don't work well for arcs because the signal to noise ratio is low and the arc signal is not periodic. Instead, wavelet transform analysis provides a time and frequency approach to analyze target signals with multiple resolutions. In this paper, a new approach using wavelet transform for arc fault detection in DC systems is proposed. Simulation models are established to study the theoretical results of the proposed methodology and traditional FFT analysis of arcing faults. Experimental data from an arcing AC system shows the efficacy is not limited to only dc power systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 39th Photovoltaic Specialists Conference

The dc circuit model explains the observed I-V hysteresis and most importantly allows scaling and optimization. A transient circuit model of memristive system is developed, based upon the dynamics, incorporating underlying electrochemistry that suggests SET and RESET transitions for a 50-nm TiO2-based memristor take approximately 120 ps to stabilize. A faster READ/WRITE operation would require appropriate conditioning circuitry. RF analysis suggests for a maximum allowable frequency of 7.5 GHz beyond which memristors can no longer be used as RRAM.

The proposed MSHE-PWM method optimizes both the dc-voltage levels and the switching angles, enabling more harmonics to be eliminated without affecting the structure of the inverter circuit. The method provides constant switching angles and linear pattern of dc-voltage levels over the modulation index range. This in turns eliminates the tedious steps required for manipulating the offline calculated switching angles and therefore, easing the implementation of the MSHE-PWM for dynamic systems. Although the method relies on the availability of the variable dc-voltage levels which can be obtained by various topologies, however, the rapid growth and development in the field of power semiconductor devices led to produce high-efficiency dc-dc converters with a relatively high-voltage capacity and for simplicity, a buck dc-dc converter is considered in this paper. Current and voltage closed loop controllers are implemented for both the STATCOM and the buck converter to meet the reactive power demand at different loading conditions. The technique is further compared with an equivalent conventional carrier-based pulse-width modulation to illustrate its enhanced characteristics. The effectiveness and the theoretical analysis of the proposed approach are verified through both simulation and experimental studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6744576/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","volume":"29","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2014","accessionNumber":"14514083","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6744576/","isStaticHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"SHE\u2013PWM Cascaded Multilevel Inverter With Adjustable DC Voltage Levels Control for STATCOM Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SHE\u2013PWM Cascaded Multilevel Inverter With Adjustable DC Voltage Levels Control for STATCOM Applications","sourcePdf":"tpel-dahidah-2306455-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1045S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6877756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"6877756","articleId":"6744576","onlineDate":"19 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6744580,"authors":[{"name":"Di-An Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7014337/6744580/li-2301458-small.gif","p":["Di-An Li received the bachelor's degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, and master's and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA.","He was a Research Assistant with VLSI CAD Lab, University of California, Santa Barbara, from 2008 to 2013.

In this paper, we first demonstrate that EM reliability analysis of a power grid can be converted to analyzing EM reliability of the grid vias. We develop a model for calculating EM lifetime of via-arrays and observe that making power grid EM-immortal carries a huge metal area overhead and possibly makes routing of both power and signal networks too difficult to complete. We propose a method for trading off power grid integrity and reliability to minimize the total metal area overhead needed to achieve the desired grid life time under power integrity constraints. Experimental results show that using our method, both EM reliability and power integrity can be met, while the additional metal area used is significantly reduced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6744580/","volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6744580/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14869979","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Method for Improving Power Grid Resilience to Electromigration-Caused via Failures","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"SRC through IBM Corporation","grantNumber":"2178.001"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-115663"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method for Improving Power Grid Resilience to Electromigration-Caused via Failures","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-li-2301458-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080666S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7014337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7014337","articleId":"6744580","onlineDate":"19 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6744586,"authors":[{"name":"Szu-Chi Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7014337/6744586/chung-2303489-small.gif","p":["Szu-Chi Chung (S'14) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronics engineering.","His current research interests include VLSI implementation of security systems."]},"firstName":"Szu-Chi","lastName":"Chung","id":"37085580688"},{"name":"Jing-Yu Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7014337/6744586/wu-2303489-small.gif","p":["Jing-Yu Wu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.","She is currently with MediaTek Inc., as a Digital Hardware Engineer.

The match between the simulated and experimental results suggests that the proposed antenna can be a good candidate for application in UWB communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2014.2306812","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/6719497/06744598.pdf","startPage":"396","endPage":"399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2014.2306812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compact Microstrip-Fed Triple Band-Notched UWB Monopole Antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6744598","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6744598/","displayDocTitle":"A Compact Microstrip-Fed Triple Band-Notched UWB Monopole Antenna","volume":"13","publicationDate":"2014","accessionNumber":"14142397","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6744598/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compact Microstrip-Fed Triple Band-Notched UWB Monopole Antenna","sourcePdf":"lawp-sarkar-2306812-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063605S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6719497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"162","xplore-issue":"6719497","articleId":"6744598","onlineDate":"19 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6744601,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Geyer","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research, Baden-D\u00e4ttwil, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6877756/6744601/6744601-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tobias Geyer (M\u201908\u2013SM\u201910) received the Dipl.-Ing. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","From 2006 to 2008, he was with the High Power Electronics Group, GE's Global Research Centre, Munich, Germany, where he focused on control and modulation schemes for large electrical drives.

However, basic optical devices, which are the key components in constructing ONoCs, experience inevitable crosstalk noise and power loss; the crosstalk noise from the basic devices accumulates in large-scale ONoCs and considerably hurts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as restricts the network scalability. For the first time, this paper presents a formal system-level analytical approach to analyze the worst-case crosstalk noise and SNR in arbitrary fat-tree-based ONoCs. The analyses are performed hierarchically at the basic optical device level, then at the optical router level, and finally at the network level. A general 4 \u00d7 4 optical router model is considered to enable the proposed method to be adaptable to fat-tree-based ONoCs using an arbitrary 4\u00d74 optical router. Utilizing the proposed general router model, the worst-case SNR link candidates in the network are determined. Moreover, we apply the proposed analyses to a case study of fat-tree-based ONoCs using an optical turnaround router (OTAR). Quantitative simulation results indicate low values of SNR and scalability constraints in large scale fat-tree-based ONoCs, which is due to the high power of crosstalk noise and power loss. For instance, in fat-tree-based ONoCs using the OTAR, when the injection laser power equals 0 dBm, the crosstalk noise power is higher than the signal power when the number of processor cores exceeds 128; when it is equal to 256, the signal power, crosstalk noise power, and SNR are -17.3, -11.9, and -5.5 dB, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fat-Tree-Based Optical Interconnection Networks Under Crosstalk Noise Constraint","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2300534","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7014337/06744606.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2300534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7014337","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6744606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6744606/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Fat-Tree-Based Optical Interconnection Networks Under Crosstalk Noise Constraint","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6744606/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14869977","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"GRF","grantNumber":"620911 and 620512"},{"fundingName":"DAG","grantNumber":"11EG05S"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fat-Tree-Based Optical Interconnection Networks Under Crosstalk Noise Constraint","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-nikdast-2300534-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073751S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7014337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7014337","articleId":"6744606","onlineDate":"19 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6744608,"authors":[{"name":"Maria Paola Clarizia","affiliation":["Atmospheric, Oceanic and Space Sciences (AOSS), National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, MI, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6823767/6744608/clari-2303831-small.gif","p":["\nMaria Paola Clarizia received the M.S. degree in telecommunications\nengineering (summa cum laude) in 2007 from the University of Sannio, Benevento, Italy, and the Ph.D.\ndegree in GNSS-reflectometry from the School of Ocean and Earth Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K.","She has worked as a Research Engineer in the field of SAR altimetry and GNSS-Reflectometry for Starlab Barcelona\n(SL), and as a Research Scientist in the field of GNSS-Reflectometry for the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)\nat the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) in Southampton.

The MV estimator exploits the partial decorrelation that is present between residual errors in the five individual wind retrievals. In particular, the RMS error in the MV estimator, at 1.65 m/s, is lower than that of each of the individual retrievals. Although they are derived from the same DDM, the partial decorrelation between their retrieval errors demonstrates that there is some unique information contained in them.

On this basis, the nearest level control is applied as the modulation method and an optimized control strategy based on the dynamic redundancy for the modular multilevel converter (MMC) is proposed. One of the main innovations is that the reference value of the capacitor voltage is derived according to the maximum output voltage of each converter arm and the safety margin which can be adjusted artificially. Unlike previous strategies, the redundancy can be adjusted dynamically, and the utilization ratio of the submodules can be effectively improved. In addition, the capacitor voltage and the inner stress are reduced, and the fault ride-through capability of the system can be enhanced. In particular, the strategy under abnormal operating conditions is also detailed in this paper. A model of two-terminal MMC-high-voltage direct current system is built in PSCAD/EMTDC, and the simulation result proves the validity and the feasibility of the proposed strategy.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2305663","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6883248/06744615.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2305663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6883248","startPage":"339","endPage":"348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Control Strategy Based on Dynamic Redundancy for the Modular Multilevel Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6744615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Control Strategy Based on Dynamic Redundancy for the Modular Multilevel Converter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6744615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14543419","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6744615/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Control Strategy Based on Dynamic Redundancy for the Modular Multilevel Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-liu-2305663-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075378S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6883248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6883248","articleId":"6744615","onlineDate":"19 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6744616,"authors":[{"name":"David R.

Here, we demonstrate that onboard analysis can excise cloud-contaminated scenes, reducing data volumes while preserving science return. We calculate optimal cloud-screening parameters in advance, exploiting stable radiometric calibration and foreknowledge of illumination and viewing geometry. Channel thresholds expressed in raw instrument values can be then uploaded to the sensor where they execute in real time at gigabit-per-second (Gb/s) data rates. We present a decision theoretic method for setting these instrument parameters and characterize performance using a continuous three-year image archive from the \u201cclassic\u201d Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-C). We then simulate the system onboard the International Space Station, where it provides factor-of-two improvements in data volume with negligible false positives. Finally, we describe a real-time demonstration onboard the AVIRIS Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) flight platform during a recent science campaign. In this blind test, cloud screening is performed without error while keeping pace with instrument data rates.","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/6823767/06744616.pdf","startPage":"6779","endPage":"6792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6823767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2014.2302587","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2014.2302587","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6744616","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Instruments","Brightness","Real-time systems","Snow","Imaging","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft instrumentation","calibration","decision theory","image sensors","infrared imaging","infrared spectroscopy","optimisation","radiometers","space vehicles","spectral analysis","visible spectrometers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AVIRIS-NG flight","AVIRIS next generation","International Space Station","AVIRIS-C","classic airborne visible-infrared imaging spectrometer","continuous three-year image archive","sensor","International Space Station","performance characterization","decision theoretic method","raw instrument value","channel threshold","radiometric calibration","optimal cloud screening parameter optimisation","cloud contaminated scene","communication resource optimisation","storage optimization","unprecedented data volume generation","next generation orbital imaging spectrometer","rapid spectral cloud screening onboard spacecraft","rapid spectral cloud screening onboard aircraft"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud screening","imaging spectroscopy","lossy compression","pattern recognition","real-time systems"]},{"kwd":["Cloud screening","imaging spectroscopy","lossy compression","pattern recognition","real-time systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6744616/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Rapid Spectral Cloud Screening Onboard Aircraft and Spacecraft","accessionNumber":"14333156","dateOfInsertion":"30 May 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6744616/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"52","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000104","fundingName":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid Spectral Cloud Screening Onboard Aircraft and Spacecraft","sourcePdf":"tgrs-thompson-2302587-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.157213S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6823767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6823767","articleId":"6744616","onlineDate":"19 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6744627,"authors":[{"name":"Mehran Mirjafari","affiliation":["Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503869/6800010/6744627/6744627-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mehran Mirjafari received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2002, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering, power electronics, and electric machines from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree in power electronics from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA, in 2013.","He is currently an Advanced Technology Engineer for Dell Inc.

For the first time, we investigate the circuit performance such as that of static RAMs (SRAMs), based on the proposed dual- k spacer FinFETs. The proposed structure enhances SRAMs performance in terms of robustness, access times, and the leakage power during all possible modes of operation. The hold, read, and write-margin increases by 8.7%, 9.4%, and 10.4%, respectively, as compared with conventional FinFET SRAM. Furthermore, the read and write access times reduces by 56% and 17.1%, respectively.

While the impact of spin-based devices on general-purpose computing platforms has been studied, they are yet to be explored in the context of domain-specific computing, where the characteristics of the devices can be matched to application characteristics through architectural customization, so as to maximize the benefits. We present the design and evaluation of a many-core domain-specific processor for the emerging application domains of Recognition and Mining (RM) using spin-based memories. The domain-specific processor has a two-level on-chip memory hierarchy consisting of a streaming access first-level memory and a random access second-level memory. Based on the memory access characteristics, we suggest the use of Domain Wall Memory (DWM) and Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) to realize the first and second levels, respectively. We develop architectural models of DWM and STT-MRAM, and use them to evaluate the proposed design and explore various architectural tradeoffs in the domain-specific processor. We evaluate the proposed design by comparing it to a CMOS-based baseline at the same technology node. For three representative RM algorithms (support vector machine, k-means clustering, and generalized learning vector quantization), the spin-memory-based design achieves an energy-delay product improvement of 1.5 \u00d7-4 \u00d7 over the CMOS baseline at iso-area. Our results suggest that spin-based memory technologies can enable significant improvements in energy efficiency and performance for highly parallel, data-intensive workloads. Our study also highlights the importance of synergistic architectural exploration along with the use of emerging devices rather than simply considering them as drop-in replacements.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2014.2306958","startPage":"881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/6891503/06744659.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2014.2306958","endPage":"894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6891503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Domain-Specific Many-core Computing using Spin-based Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6744659/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Domain-Specific Many-core Computing using Spin-based Memory","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6744659/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14564368","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Domain-Specific Many-core Computing using Spin-based Memory","sourcePdf":"tnano-venkatesan-2306958-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109068S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6891503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6891503","articleId":"6744659","onlineDate":"19 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6744678,"authors":[{"name":"Diego Pardo","affiliation":["Signal, System and Radiocommunications Department, Technical University of Madrid, E.T.S.I.

However, in specific \u03bcW power-harvesting applications, the Schottky diode technique fails to provide a satisfactory RF-dc conversion efficiency mainly because of its high zero-bias junction resistance. This paper examines the state-of-the-art low-power microwave-to-dc energy conversion techniques. A comprehensive picture of the state-of-the-art on this aspect is given graphically, which compares different technologies such as transistor, diode, and CMOS schemes. Subsequent to the highlighted limitations of current devices, this work introduces, for the first time, a nonlinear component for low-power rectification based on a recent discovery in spintronics, namely, the spindiode. Along with an analysis of the role of nonlinearity and zero bias resistance in the rectification process of the spindiode, it is shown how the spindiode could enhance the rectification efficiency even at a very low-power level and how this technique would shift the design paradigms of diode-based devices and circuits.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/6782344/06744680.pdf","startPage":"965","endPage":"976","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2014.2305134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2014.2305134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782344","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6744680","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Low-Power High-Efficiency RF and Microwave Energy Harvesting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schottky diodes","Radio frequency","Resistance","Junctions","Microwave circuits","Microwave devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","low-power electronics","magnetoelectronics","microwave power transmission","MMIC","power convertors","rectification","rectifying circuits","Schottky diode mixers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RF energy harvesting","microwave energy harvesting","microwave integrated techniques","RF integrated techniques","rectifying circuit","mixing circuit","Schottky diode technique","RF-DC conversion efficiency","zero bias junction resistance","low power microwave-to-DC energy conversion technique","nonlinear component","low-power rectification efficiency","spintronics","nonlinearity analysis","rectification process","spindiode","diode-based device","diode-based circuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-power and high-efficiency energy harvesting","magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)","microwave power transmission","rectifier","Schottky diode","signal detection","spin polarized transport"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6744680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Towards Low-Power High-Efficiency RF and Microwave Energy Harvesting","volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6744680/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14209909","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Low-Power High-Efficiency RF and Microwave Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"tmtt-hemour-2305134-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144281S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6782344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"6782344","articleId":"6744680","onlineDate":"19 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6744684,"authors":[{"name":"Run Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering \u2013 Electrophysics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6803076/6744684/6744684-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Run Chen (S'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

It utilizes synchronized samples captured during transients from both ends of the transmission line to detect, classify, and locate transmission-line faults and can verify that the tripped line has indeed experienced a fault. The proposed method is tested for several faults simulated on an IEEE 118-bus test system and it has been concluded that it can detect and classify a fault using prefault and postfault recorded samples within 7 ms of fault inception and can accurately locate a fault with 3% accuracy. This time response performance is highly desirable since with the increasing use of modern circuit breakers, which can open the faulty line in less than two cycles, the time window of the captured waveforms is significantly reduced due to the unavailability of measurement signals after breakers open.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Transmission line measurements","Fault detection","Voltage measurement","Power transmission lines","Reactive power","Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit breakers","fault location","power transmission faults","power transmission protection","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission-line fault analysis","synchronized sampling","IEEE 118-bus test system","prefault classification","postfault classification","fault inception","circuit breakers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electromagnetic transients","fault detection","fault location","power system faults","power system protection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2296788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/6776443/06744686.pdf","startPage":"942","endPage":"950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2013.2296788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission-Line Fault Analysis Using Synchronized Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6744686","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transmission-Line Fault Analysis Using Synchronized Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6744686/","volume":"29","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6744686/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14181397","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission-Line Fault Analysis Using Synchronized Sampling","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-dutta-2296788-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074205S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"6776443","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6776443","articleId":"6744686","onlineDate":"19 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":6744690,"authors":[{"name":"Maheshwar Pd.

In particular, they exhibit all of the fingerprints of memristors, including the characteristic pinched hysteresis Lissajous figures in the voltage-current plane, whose loop areas shrink as the frequency of the periodic excitation signal increases. Moreover, the pinched hysteresis loops for the potassium ion-channel memristor, and the sodium ion-channel memristor, from the Hodgkin-Huxley axon circuit model are unique for each periodic excitation signal. An in-depth circuit-theoretic analysis and characterizations of these two classic biological memristors are presented via their small-signal memristive equivalent circuits, their frequency response, and their Nyquist plots. Just as the Hodgkin-Huxley circuit model has stood the test of time, its constituent potassium ion-channel and sodium ion-channel memristors are destined to be classic examples of locally-active memristors in future textbooks on circuit theory and bio-physics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6744690/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2014","publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6744690/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14112153","volume":"14","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Brains Are Made of Memristors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brains Are Made of Memristors","sourcePdf":"14mcas01-sah-2296414-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127357S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7384","isNumber":"6744672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7384","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6744672","articleId":"6744690","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6745070,"authors":[{"name":"Eirini Gkoutioudi","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Sweden"],"firstName":"Eirini","lastName":"Gkoutioudi","id":"37086752856"},{"name":"Panagiotis Bakas","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Sweden"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Bakas","id":"37688457100"},{"name":"Antonios Marinopoulos","affiliation":["ABB Corporate Research, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, Sweden"],"firstName":"Antonios","lastName":"Marinopoulos","id":"37671234800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3299-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3298-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0160-8371"}],"articleNumber":"6745070","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":980},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Conductors","Power cables","Photovoltaic systems","Electric potential"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conductors (electric)","invertors","photovoltaic power systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PV array system","photovoltaic array system","maximum permissible DC voltage","inverter input specifications","inverter maximum voltage rating","combiner box","CB","conductor mass saving","voltage 1000 kV","voltage 1500 kV","power 800 kW","power 1.5 MW","power 3 MW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Photovoltaics (PV)","PV array design","PV array sizing","PV low voltage cables","PV system voltage","cost reduction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6745070","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of PV systems with maximum DC voltage 1000V and 1500V","doi":"10.1109/PVSC.2013.6745070","startPage":"2873","endPage":"2878","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 39th Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 39th Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731006/6744078/06745070.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6744078","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2013.6745070","abstract":"The purpose of this work is the comparison of two different photovoltaic (PV) arrays with different maximum permissible voltage from a technical point of view. In addition, inverter input specifications are taken into account since they affect the PV array design. The comparative cases include PV arrays with inverters of 1000 and 1500 V maximum input voltage. The most commonly used are those with 1000V maximum voltage, but it is claimed that by using those with 1500 V maximum voltage there is potential for more cost effective PV systems. One of the PV array design parameters that are affected by the inverter's maximum voltage rating is the number of PV modules that can be connected in series. In this study it is shown how the ratio of number of PV modules per string (Nms ratio) between the two comparative cases is related to the reduction of the PV array cabling and number of combiner boxes (CB). In addition the comparison was iterated for various Nms ratios and for three inverter power ratings of 800kW, 1.5MW and 3MW. Finally, the savings in conductor mass and number of CB of the PV array with respect to the Nms ratio of the two comparative studies are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745070/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-21 June 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14116311","publicationDate":"June 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6745070/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-21 June 2013","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of PV systems with maximum DC voltage 1000V and 1500V","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of PV systems with maximum DC voltage 1000V and 1500V","confLoc":"Tampa, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"799.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029156S","chronDate":"16-21 June 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6731006","isNumber":"6744078","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6731006","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6744078","articleId":"6745070","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6745077,"authors":[{"name":"Mehran Mirjafari","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX"],"firstName":"Mehran","lastName":"Mirjafari","id":"37293840800"},{"name":"Robert S.

Thus, a new method that can locate and detect nucleus effectively is proposed in this paper. As a precursor to accurate segmentation, shape modeling of cells is required. Our method incorporates a priori knowledge about cell shape. That is, an elliptical cell contour model is introduced to describe the boundary of the cell. Our method consists of the following components: Firstly, the initial segmented regions are obtained by using C-means clustering algorithm. Secondly, locate the center of cells accurately through the RANSAC (random sample consensus) method. Finally, a reformed level set evolution is introduced to extract the edge of nucleus. The experiment result shows that, nucleus can be located accurately; even if the cell image has a complex background and is obscured by other objects.

It is defined as on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable resources (e.g. network). The main idea of cloud is to provide on-demand computing services with high reliability, scalability and availability in a distributed environment. Outsourcing and extension of business through cloud has provided customer an ease of the local data storage and maintenance. However, the customer no longer has physical possession of the possibly large size of outsourced data. This draws a security concern on the data integrity protection in cloud computing especially for customers with constrained computing resources and capabilities. Security is one of the major factor that hampers the growth of cloud computing. An estimation of security risks in cloud computing systems is an essential part of the process of security measures. For a proper estimation of security risk requires a good knowledge about the probability distributions of different upcoming events. This paper focuses on security measures and simulation of security risk in cloud computing. Probability distribution model is used for simulation of possible security risk in cloud services.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud computing and security measure","publicationTitle":"2013 6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)","doi":"10.1109/CISP.2013.6745284","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 6th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6731781/6745201/06745284.pdf","startPage":"852","endPage":"857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CISP.2013.6745284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6745201","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6745284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745284/","xploreNote":"Please be advised that the paper you have accessed is a draft of the final paper that was presented at the conference.

Modern field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is a suitable candidate for implementing any reasonably complex architecture within minimal design time. Apart from the logic resources, most of the FPGAs contain hard-macro elements. By using a fixed-point data path, the available FPGA macro elements can be used to design an architecture that is much more complex. The realization of the complex arithmetic elements can be simpler by using a logarithmic number system. In this paper, a novel architecture and the FPGA realization of an antilogarithmic computing circuit is proposed. The proposed antilogarithmic circuit uses piecewise linear approximation method. The same architecture works for both the positive and negative binary numbers. A unique barrel-shifter is designed which shifts the input data to the left or right by the required amount. The proposed architecture is implemented in the Xilinx Virtex-5 xc5vfx70t device. The device utilization shows that the architecture utilizes a minimal FPGA resource. We have also performed error analysis of the approximation result. The error analysis shows that error associated with the positive numbers is 0.16% while that for the negative numbers is 0.8%. The error can be further minimized by taking more bits for the fractional bit representation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14117518","htmlLink":"/document/6745340/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","conferenceDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-Based Novel Architecture for the Fixed-Point Binary Antilogarithmic Computation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-Based Novel Architecture for the Fixed-Point Binary Antilogarithmic Computation","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"2102a023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046338S","chronDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6745199","isNumber":"6745317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745199","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6745317","articleId":"6745340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6745344,"authors":[{"name":"A.P.

The complexity of the system increases with the increase in antenna configuration or the constellation size. Some pre-processing is a fundamental prerequisite in iterative detectors to reduce the system complexity by focusing the received signal energy to reduce the effect of inter-symbol interference. The QR Decomposition (QRD) of communication channel matrices in the pre-processor stage is an important issue to ensure good performance of the subsequent steps of decoding thus a QRD) is commonly used in many MIMO detection algorithms. A sorted QR decomposition (SQRD) is an advanced algorithm that improves the performance of MIMO detection. In this paper the efficiency of QRD and SQRD methods in terms of computational complexity, error rate performance and the FPGA resources utilized is presented. The main contribution of this work is a comparison of hardware implementations of the QRD and SQRD system. QRD for 4x4 MIMO system is implemented on various target FPGA platforms to compare their area utilization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of QR Decomposition for MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Electronic Systems, Signal Processing and Computing Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ICESC.2014.20","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Electronic Systems, Signal Processing and Computing Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745199/6745317/06745348.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"73","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICESC.2014.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6745317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6745348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of QR Decomposition for MIMO Systems","conferenceDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6745348/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14117532","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of QR Decomposition for MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"2102a069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082117S","chronDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6745199","isNumber":"6745317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745199","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6745317","articleId":"6745348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6745350,"authors":[{"name":"M.S.

But the smartphones have some resource constraints like processing power, battery capacity, limited bandwidth for connecting to the Internet, etc. Therefore, to improve the performance of smartphone in terms of processing power, battery and memory, the technology namely, augmented execution is the best solution in the mobile cloud computing (MCC) scenario. Mobile cloud computing works as the combination of mobile computing and cloud computing. Augmented execution alleviates the problem of resource scarcity of smartphone. To get the benefits from the resource-abundant clouds, massive computation intensive tasks are partitioned and migrated to the cloud side for the execution. After executing the task at the cloud side, the results are sent back to the smartphone. This method is called as the computation offloading. The given survey paper focuses on the partitioning techniques in mobile cloud computing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Augmented Execution in Mobile Cloud Computing: A Survey","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Electronic Systems, Signal Processing and Computing Technologies","doi":"10.1109/ICESC.2014.46","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Electronic Systems, Signal Processing and Computing Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745199/6745317/06745380.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICESC.2014.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6745317","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6745380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745380/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Augmented Execution in Mobile Cloud Computing: A Survey","conferenceDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6745380/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14127423","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Augmented Execution in Mobile Cloud Computing: A Survey","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"2102a237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11756S","chronDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6745199","isNumber":"6745317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745199","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6745317","articleId":"6745380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6745396,"authors":[{"name":"Mayank Agrawal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Mayank","lastName":"Agrawal","id":"37604968200"},{"name":"Ratnakar Dash","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, Odisha, India"],"firstName":"Ratnakar","lastName":"Dash","id":"37411838000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2102-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6745396","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":416},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Discrete wavelet transforms","Interpolation","PSNR","Visualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image enhancement","image reconstruction","image resolution","interpolation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution enhancement","stationary wavelet transform","lifting wavelet transform","high frequency sub-band interpolation","LWT","input low resolution image","SWT","edge enhancement","inverse lifting wavelet transformation","ILWT","high resolution image","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lifting wavelet transform","Stationary wavelet transform","Surface Fitting","Inverse Lifting wavelet transform"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a technique for enhancing resolution of images by interpolating high frequency sub-bands generated using lifting wavelet transform (LWT) and spatial information of input low resolution (LR) image.

The generated HF sub-bands are interpolated further. Different high frequency sub-bands obtained through SWT are added to correct the estimated HF sub-bands. The input LR image is interpolated in parallel. All these sub-bands and estimated LR image are reconstructed by inverse lifting wavelet transformation (ILWT) to produce high resolution image.

Although the detection of edits is fundamental to any kind of video analysis since it segments a video into its basic components, the shots, only few comparative investigations on early shot boundary detection algorithms have been published. A vast number of proposed techniques exist for shot boundary detection but the major criticisms to them are their inefficiency and lack of reliability. The reliability of the scene change detection stage is a very significant requirement because it is the first stage in any video retrieval system. This paper gives a comparative study of Block Matching Algorithm (BMA) and Complex Wavelet Transform (CWT) algorithm. BMA uses motion vectors to detect shot transition in videos and CWT uses edges of the objects, are invariant to illumination changes. The algorithm performance is measured in terms of hit rate, number of false hits, and miss rate for hard cuts, fades, and dissolves over a large and diverse set of video sequences.","doi":"10.1109/ICESC.2014.85","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Electronic Systems, Signal Processing and Computing Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Electronic Systems, Signal Processing and Computing Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745199/6745317/06745421.pdf","startPage":"450","endPage":"455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICESC.2014.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6745317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative Study of Block Matching Algorithm and Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform for Shot Detection in Videos","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6745421","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745421/","displayDocTitle":"Comparative Study of Block Matching Algorithm and Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform for Shot Detection in Videos","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14117515","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6745421/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative Study of Block Matching Algorithm and Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Transform for Shot Detection in Videos","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"2102a450.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056768S","chronDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6745199","isNumber":"6745317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745199","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6745317","articleId":"6745421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6745423,"authors":[{"name":"Nirmal S.

The major problem observed in cellular structure is to provide the proper service to the users at the boundary of the cell. To increase the capacity of cell, it is essential to put the multiple antenna systems at the base station and even at user equipments. Space-time block codes are a remarkable modulation scheme discovered recently for the multiple antenna wireless channels. Multiple transmit and receive antennas can be used in wireless systems to achieve high data rate communication. Recently, efficient space-time codes have been developed that utilize a large portion of the available capacity. These codes are designed under the assumption that the transmitter has no knowledge about the channel. Multi-antenna systems can be used for increased capacity or for increasing diversity order, but the cost paid for deriving these benefits is increased hardware complexity due to multiple antennas and the number of RF (Radio Frequency) chains. This paper focuses on to implement the MIMO system in cellular structure at both base station and user equipment in order to boost the overall capacity of the system. It is seen that the capacity of the system increases with increase in number of antennas at the BTS end.","doi":"10.1109/ICESC.2014.87","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Electronic Systems, Signal Processing and Computing Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Electronic Systems, Signal Processing and Computing Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745199/6745317/06745423.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICESC.2014.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6745317","startPage":"465","endPage":"467","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Space-Time Block Coded MIMO Systems for Cell Edge Users in Rayleigh Fading Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6745423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Space-Time Block Coded MIMO Systems for Cell Edge Users in Rayleigh Fading Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745423/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14127446","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6745423/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Space-Time Block Coded MIMO Systems for Cell Edge Users in Rayleigh Fading Channel","confLoc":"Nagpur, India","sourcePdf":"2102a465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041846S","chronDate":"9-11 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6745199","isNumber":"6745317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745199","xplore-issue":"6745317","articleId":"6745423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6745443,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The vector rotation in the x/y plane can be realized by rotating a vector through a series of elementary angles. These elementary angles are chosen such that the vector rotation through each of them may be approximated easily with a simple shift and add operation, and their algebraic sum approaches the required rotation angle. This can be exercised by CORDIC (CO-ordinate Rotation Digital Computer) algorithm in rotation mode. Pipelined architecture by pre computation of direction of micro rotation, radix-4 number representation, and the angle generator has been processed in terms of hardware complexity, iteration delay and memory reduction. The proposed algorithm also exercises an addressing scheme and the associated angle generator logic in order to eliminate the ROM usage for bottling the twiddle factors. It incorporates parallelism and pipe line processing. The latency of the system is n/2 clock cycles. The throughput rate is one valid result per eight clock cycles. The approached architecture for radix-4, 16-bit precision and 16-point FFT was implemented on FPGA platform virtex 5 and simulated to validate the results.

Cognitive Radio acts as a solution to the problem of spectrum under-utilization. Spectrum sensing is the most important feature of Cognitive Radio. Cooperative spectrum sensing improves sensing performance by including a number of cognitive users rather than a single one. In cooperative spectrum sensing, each cognitive radio performs individual spectrum sensing by any of the available methods and individual sensing results are combined according to certain rules. We propose a novel method where signal to noise ratio, credibility and position information of secondary users are used for spectrum sensing. They are much important factors that affect the sensing, but were not considered in previous works. The performance of this scheme is investigated by simulation results and is much better than the traditional ones. Significant improvement in detection probabilities are achieved reducing false alarm rates even in situations including malicious users and hidden primary user.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14117320","htmlLink":"/document/6745444/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach in cooperative spectrum sensing for cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach in cooperative spectrum sensing for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Trivandrum, India","sourcePdf":"RAICS20131569804511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064068S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732240","isNumber":"6745433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732240","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6745433","articleId":"6745444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6745445,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering National Institute of Technology Calicut, India-673601"],"lastName":"Abhishek"},{"name":"Sudhish N George","affiliation":["National Institute of Technology Calicut, Calicut, Kerala, IN"],"firstName":"Sudhish N","lastName":"George"},{"name":"P.

Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) schemes, when incorporated into WiMAX helps the system to react dynamically to the channel variations thereby providing higher data rates and improve BER performance. Based on the channel state information, both the modulation and coding rates can be varied so as to achieve higher throughput and improve spectral efficiency. This work proposes an efficient adaptive modulation coding technique, which maximizes the throughput, while maintaining a target BER. It proposes to select a particular modulation coding scheme along with the corresponding coding rates based on the given threshold.

This paper proposes the use of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based radio to sense the environment. Our solution uses an OFDM wireless transmitter, such as the one from Wi-Fi, on the robot to transmit a signal which is then reflected back by obstacles, and the reflected signal is captured with an onboard receiver. The receiver analyzes the incoming signal for multipath delay and angles of arrival of each of these resolvable multipath components. The angle of arrival estimation is achieved without using a large antenna array at the receiver, but with an iterative angle estimation mechanism that can work with just two receive antennas. The resulting range sensor can detect obstacles at multiple directions and multiple distances by analyzing just one received Wi-Fi packet. The generated obstacle map is then improved by combining different map instances estimated by the robot from different positions. Advantages of this sensor includes very fast scan time and, since we can reuse the ubiquitous Wi-Fi radio to transmit the OFDM signal on air, the sensor cost is much lower compared to traditional range sensors.","doi":"10.1109/RAICS.2013.6745447","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems (RAICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems (RAICS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732240/6745433/06745447.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"63","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAICS.2013.6745447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6745433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM radio based range and direction sensor for robotics applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6745447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745447/","displayDocTitle":"OFDM radio based range and direction sensor for robotics applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14117286","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6745447/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM radio based range and direction sensor for robotics applications","confLoc":"Trivandrum, India","sourcePdf":"RAICS20131569809275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040829S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732240","isNumber":"6745433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732240","xplore-issue":"6745433","articleId":"6745447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6745466,"authors":[{"name":"P.

With the aid of CE-BEM we need to estimate only the basis expansion coefficients instead of actual impulse responses of the channels. Our proposed scheme make use of a line search method based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) criteria. The complete set of parameters, which includes both CFO and basis coefficients for all the users, are updated in each iteration by minimizing the error between the successive iterations.

The approach is based on sparse and redundant representations over trained dictionaries. The method involves identifying a dictionary that represents high resolution patches in a sparse manner. Extra information from similar structures that exist in remote sensing images can be introduced to dictionary in the CS framework. K-SVD method is used for finding the dictionary and TV Minimization method is used for finding the sparse representation coefficients. Instead of using the HR patches from an external database, the proposed method uses the patches from the interpolated version of the LR image for training the dictionary. The method is compared with other single image super resolution algorithms that use sparse recovery methods such as Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm.

In this method the relationship between low resolution (LR) patches is learnt by fuzzy c-means clustering. By choosing a suitable overcomplete dictionary, LR patch can be represented as a sparse linear combination of the elements from the dictionary. So we are finding a sparse representation for each LR patch and use the coefficient to generate the corresponding high resolution (HR) patch. When an input LR patch is given LR training patches in the selected cluster are sorted based on the decreasing value of membership, which is used for finding the neighbors. Then Robust-SLO algorithm and k/K nearest neighbor selection are used for finding optimal weights and neighboring HR training patches for each LR input patch. The experimental results show that the proposed method gives better results quantitatively and subjectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Clustering algorithms","Training data","Image resolution","PSNR","Robustness","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","image resolution","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["example based super-resolution","single-image super resolution","sparse neighbor embedding","sparse signal representation","LR patch","low resolution patch","fuzzy c-means clustering","overcomplete dictionary","high resolution patch","HR patch","membership value","Robust-SLO algorithm","k-K nearest neighbor selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy clustering","Histogram of oriented gradients (HoG)","sparse representation","neighbor embedding (NE)","Robust-SLO algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RAICS.2013.6745482","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems (RAICS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Recent Advances in Intelligent Computational Systems (RAICS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732240/6745433/06745482.pdf","startPage":"251","endPage":"256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6745433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAICS.2013.6745482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Example based super-resolution using fuzzy clustering and sparse neighbor embedding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6745482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Example based super-resolution using fuzzy clustering and sparse neighbor embedding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745482/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6745482/","accessionNumber":"14117289","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Example based super-resolution using fuzzy clustering and sparse neighbor embedding","confLoc":"Trivandrum, India","sourcePdf":"RAICS20131569818483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053334S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6732240","isNumber":"6745433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6732240","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6745433","articleId":"6745482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6745490,"authors":[{"name":"Archana Aniyan","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering Department, College of Engineering, Chengannur, Alappuzha, India"],"firstName":"Archana","lastName":"Aniyan","id":"37086757003"},{"name":"J.

The behavior of Pd at the Au wire-Al pad bonding interface during the thermal aging, and the effect of Pd on Au/Al interfacial reactions were investigated.

The ESM has to be disseminated within a specified area with stringent delay and delivery ratio requirements, while the PBM does not need to meet these requirements. For exchanging the safety messages in Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET), Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) is necessary whose de facto standard is Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC). However, the effective transmission range in the DSRC-based IVC is short since a signal can be attenuated due to blocking by obstacles. In order to cover a large dissemination area in the DSRC-based IVC, multi-hop dissemination is required, which however causes channel collision and network congestion. Moreover, the coexistence with PBMs aggravates the collision and the congestion, which make it hard to satisfy the requirements of the ESM dissemination. To overcome the limitation of the DSRC, we utilize an extra TV White Space (TVWS) band that has a large communication range for ESM disseminations, and exploit a DSRC band for 1) the exchange of control data and 2) the compensation of ESM reception errors. In this paper, we propose and analyze a distributed channel usage framework that exploits advantages of DSRC and TVWS bands for ESM dissemination under the existence of PBMs. Our scheme employs TVWS Channel Rendezvous Algorithm (TCRA), ensuring that vehicles within a dissemination area select the same channel with the ESM sender. To compensate ESM reception failures in a TVWS band, our scheme adopts Two-Way Recovery Algorithm (TWRA) that uses DSRC and TVWS bands for ESM retransmission. Further, we establish an analytical delivery ratio model that considers a delay bound of an ESM for optimal parameter selections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose a distributed channel usage scheme that leverages the strengths of TVWS and DSRC bands for safety message dissemination. Through an in-depth simulation study, we show that the proposed scheme satisfies ESM requirements for latency and packet delivery ratio, and outperforms previous approaches in various vehicular scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.1411RP02","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06745898.pdf","startPage":"2117","endPage":"2133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.1411RP02","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interplay Between TVWS and DSRC: Optimal Strategy for Safety Message Dissemination in VANET","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6745898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745898/","displayDocTitle":"Interplay Between TVWS and DSRC: Optimal Strategy for Safety Message Dissemination in VANET","volume":"32","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2014","accessionNumber":"14811241","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6745898/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interplay Between TVWS and DSRC: Optimal Strategy for Safety Message Dissemination in VANET","sourcePdf":"2117jsac1114lim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0782S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6745898","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6745900,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Shu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Oakland University, Rochester, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6985733/6745900/6745900-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tao Shu received his Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from The University of Arizona in Dec. 2010.

A resource-constrained CR relies on sequential channel sensing and probing to resolve spectrum uncertainty and search for good transmission opportunities in real time. We are interested in maximizing the effective throughput the CR can achieve with a desired confidence (success probability) under a spectrum access delay constraint. This quantity can be interpreted as the QoS-compliant (e.g., min-rate and delay) capacity of the CR link under the uncertain spectrum environment. The optimization is formulated as a finite-horizon optimal stopping problem under the objective of maximizing a given percentile of the rate of return at the stopping time. This formulation cannot be directly solved by classical optimal stopping theory, because the latter only supports a mean-reward objective function. A novel transformation is developed to convert the problem into solving a series of sub problems, each of which optimizes a transformed mean-reward of the original problem and therefore can be solved using classical optimal stopping method. We prove the monotonicity of the sub problems, based on which we develop a fast algorithm to efficiently find the unique solution to the original problem. To account for different MAC mechanisms used in practice, our analysis considers both non-recall and recall channel decision strategies. Extensive simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness and significance of the optimization. We show that significant gains (e.g., over 30%) on the QoS-compliant capacity can be achieved by the proposed algorithm when compared with the counterparts.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.1411RP04","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","startPage":"2013","endPage":"2025","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06745900.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Compliant Sequential Channel Sensing for Cognitive Radios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6745900/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"QoS-Compliant Sequential Channel Sensing for Cognitive Radios","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2014","accessionNumber":"14811243","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-Compliant Sequential Channel Sensing for Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"2013jsac1114shu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101715S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6745900","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6745901,"authors":[{"name":"Navid Tadayon","affiliation":["Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS-EMT), University of Quebec, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6985733/6745901/6745901-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Navid Tadayon (S'10) received his B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering, Telecommunications, from Ferdowsi University, Mashhad, Iran, in 2006, and his M.Sc. degree from University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, USA, in 2011.

This model enables us to conduct a performance analysis in the most general form by the derivation of the probability mass function (PMF) of queue length at the secondary users (SUs). In the second part, a reverse problem is considered to answer the important top-down question of whether a service requirement can be satisfied in a multi-channel CRN knowing the network parameters and traffic situation with respect to the SUs and the primary users (PUs). Terming this problem as the network synthesis, a precise conservation law is obtained, which relates the packet waiting times of both types of users, and based on which the achievable region of the network is also determined. Lastly, by the introduction of a mixed strategy, the conditions for the existence of an optimal trade-off between the interference onto the PUs and the quality-of-service of the SUs is shown, and the optimal mixed strategy is obtained when those conditions are satisfied.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.1411RP06","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06745901.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.1411RP06","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"2065","endPage":"2074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks: Modeling, Analysis and Synthesis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6745901","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks: Modeling, Analysis and Synthesis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745901/","volume":"32","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6745901/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2014","accessionNumber":"14811242","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks: Modeling, Analysis and Synthesis","sourcePdf":"2065jsac1114tadayon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076767S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6745901","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6745902,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoshi Song","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6985733/6745902/6745902-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoshi Song (S'08) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2008.

Two threshold-based OSA schemes, namely the primary receiver assisted (PRA) protocol and the primary transmitter assisted (PTA) protocol, are investigated. Under the PRA/PTA protocols, a secondary transmitter (ST) is allowed to access the spectrum only when the maximum signal power of the received beacons/pilots sent from the active primary receivers/transmitters (PRs/PTs) is lower than a certain threshold. To measure the resulting transmission opportunity for the secondary users by the proposed OSA protocols, the concept of spatial opportunity, which is defined as the probability that an arbitrary location in the primary network is detected as a spatial spectrum hole, is introduced and then evaluated by applying tools from stochastic geometry. Based on spatial opportunity, the coverage (non-outage transmission) performance in the overlay CR network is analyzed. With the obtained results of spatial opportunity and coverage probability, we finally characterize the spatial throughput, which is defined as the average spatial density of successful transmissions in the primary/secondary network, under the PRA and PTA protocols, respectively.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.1411RP05","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","startPage":"2190","endPage":"2204","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06745902.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial Throughput Characterization in Cognitive Radio Networks with Threshold-Based Opportunistic Spectrum Access","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6745902/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spatial Throughput Characterization in Cognitive Radio Networks with Threshold-Based Opportunistic Spectrum Access","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November 2014","accessionNumber":"14811248","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"11","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial Throughput Characterization in Cognitive Radio Networks with Threshold-Based Opportunistic Spectrum Access","sourcePdf":"2190jsac1114song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133032S","chronDate":"November  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6985733","articleId":"6745902","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6745903,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Zhang","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Wee Peng Tay","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Wee Peng","lastName":"Tay"},{"name":"Kwok Hung Li","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Kwok Hung","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Dominique Gaiti","affiliation":["Universite de Technologie de Troyes, Troyes, FR"],"firstName":"Dominique","lastName":"Gaiti"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"6745903","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Throughput","Minimization","Cognitive radio","Interference","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","distributed algorithms","estimation theory","least squares approximations","message passing","radio spectrum management","signal detection","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares support vector machine approach","estimation error","message passing","secondary users","primary user","cognitive radio networks","spectrum sensing","distributed boundary estimation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","boundary estimation","spectrum sensing"]}],"abstract":"In a cognitive radio network, a primary user (PU) shares its spectrum with secondary users (SUs) temporally and spatially, while allowing for some interference.

We propose a distributed boundary estimation algorithm that allows SUs to estimate the boundary of the no-talk region collaboratively through message passing between SUs, and analyze the trade-offs between estimation error, communication cost, setup complexity, throughput and robustness. Simulations suggest that our proposed scheme has better estimation performance and communication cost trade-off compared to several other alternative benchmark methods, and is more robust to SU sensing errors, except when compared to the least squares support vector machine approach, which however incurs a much higher communication cost.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.1411RP08","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6985733/06745903.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6985733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.1411RP08","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"1961","endPage":"1973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Boundary Estimation for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6745903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Boundary Estimation for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6745903/","volume":"32","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"November 2014","accessionNumber":"14818095","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Boundary Estimation for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"1961jsac1114zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038658S","chronDate":"November  2014","isNumber":"6985733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"8","articleId":"6745903","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6746001,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjun Lu","affiliation":["Google, Mountain View, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/6705689/6746001/6746001-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wenjun Lu received the B.S.E.

Preserving confidentiality of online personal data while offering efficient functionalities thus becomes an important and pressing research issue. In this paper, we study the problem of content-based search of image data archived online while preserving content confidentiality. The problem has different settings from those typically considered in the secure computation literature, as it deals with data in rank-ordered search, and has a different security-efficiency requirement. Secure computation techniques, such as homomorphic encryption, can potentially be used in this application, at a cost of high computational and communication complexity. Alternatively, efficient techniques based on randomizing visual feature and search indexes have been proposed recently to enable similarity comparison between encrypted images. This paper focuses on comparing these two major paradigms of techniques, namely, homomorphic encryption-based techniques and feature/index randomization-based techniques, for confidentiality-preserving image search. We develop novel and systematic metrics to quantitatively evaluate security strength in this unique type of data and applications. We compare these two paradigms of techniques in terms of their search performance, security strength, and computational efficiency.

In this letter, we introduce a simple model of the cloaked PEC cylinder, of noninfinitesimal electrical size, by replacing it with an omnidirectional electric-line scatterer and a bipolar magnetic one. The analysis of the results shows that the optimal cloaking regime corresponds to the frequency point where the total electric moment is drastically mitigated; in the vicinity of this regime, we observe a behavior similar to Huygens' pairs. This explains the cloaking effect and shows that the radiation patterns of the device are directly controllable through the material parameters of the configuration, a feature that is useful in practical applications.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719497","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2014.2307015","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/6719497/06746011.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"406","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2014.2307015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Minimal Scattering Response of PEC Cylinders in a Dielectric Cloak","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","displayDocTitle":"On the Minimal Scattering Response of PEC Cylinders in a Dielectric Cloak","volume":"13","htmlLink":"/document/6746011/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2014","accessionNumber":"14142399","dateOfInsertion":"07 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746011/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Minimal Scattering Response of PEC Cylinders in a Dielectric Cloak","sourcePdf":"lawp-valagiannopoulos-2307015-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103579S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6719497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6719497","articleId":"6746011","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6746019,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We demonstrate reduction of the LO frequency drift and linewidth after wavelength switching by compensation using the phase section of the laser and achieve negligible BER penalty with burst-mode reception for single-mode fiber transmission up to 1280 km. We also measure the sensitivity of the receiver to LO detuning when multiple wavelength-division multiplexed channels are received simultaneously as in a broadcast-and-select network architecture.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2014.2306594","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/6776431/06746025.pdf","startPage":"813","endPage":"816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2014.2306594","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast-Tuning Coherent Burst-Mode Receiver for Metropolitan Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746025/","displayDocTitle":"Fast-Tuning Coherent Burst-Mode Receiver for Metropolitan Networks","volume":"26","issue":"8","publicationDate":"April15, 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6746025/","dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast-Tuning Coherent Burst-Mode Receiver for Metropolitan Networks","sourcePdf":"lpt-simsarian-2306594-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058901S","chronDate":"April15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"6776431","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6776431","articleId":"6746025","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6746034,"authors":[{"name":"Alan H.

Without using any additional coupling elements between these closely mounted antennas, both high isolation ( > 17 dB) and low envelope correlation coefficient (ECC <; 0.05 ) are achieved.

In this paper, we introduce a model and perform simulations to elucidate the recently discovered successful operation of this new PON source. The results are in agreement with experiments; the formation of a narrow laser spectrum with a relatively constant output power is seen despite a relatively broad passband window of the waveguide grating router. We further study mode competition and mode partition noise. It is shown that proper chromatic dispersion management can overcome mode partition noise limitations. The quality of the RSOA fiber cavity laser does not degrade when being directly modulated and as a result these highly multimode lasers offer an economic way to transport Gbit/s upstream data over kilometers of fiber in a wavelength division multiplexing-PON.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cavity resonators","Optical fiber dispersion","Fiber lasers","Mathematical

and quadrature-amplitude modulated (QAM) signals, including Nyquist pulse shaping. It is based on phase-stable optical time-division multiplex (OTDM) of two tributaries, which are modulated at half the target symbol rate, optical Nyquist filtering, and a broadband digital coherent receiver. The system is analyzed in back-to-back experiments with binary PSK (BPSK) modulation, quadrature-PSK (QPSK) modulation, as well as with 16-ary QAM. Compared to all-ETDM implementations, the transmitter is based on independent electro-optical modulation of two time-division multiplex tributaries and subsequent optical interleaving after modulation. Although this scheme implies increased hardware complexity, it enables lower penalties with respect to theory compared to all-ETDM experiments presented so far. This is due to the reduced hardware speed requirements. The measured penalties at bit-error ratios of 1 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-3</sup>\n are 0.5, 1.5, and 6 dB for single-polarization BPSK, QPSK, and 16QAM, respectively.

Cloud Txn is a multilayer transmission system like layered-division multiplexing. The transmitted signal is formed by superimposing a number of independent signals at desired power levels to form a multilayered signal. The signals of different layers can have different coding, bit rate, and robustness. The upper layer system parameters are chosen to provide very robust transmission that can be used for high-speed mobile broadcasting. The bit rate is traded for powerful coding and robustness so that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold at the receiver is in the range of -2 to -3 dB. The top layer is designed to withstand combined noise, co-channel interference and multipath distortion power levels higher than the desired signal power. The lower-layer signal can be a DVB-T2 signal or another new system to deliver HDTV/UHDTV to fixed receivers. The system concept is open to technological advances that might come in the future: BICM/non uniform-QAM, rotated constellations, time frequency slicing or MIMO techniques can be implemented in the Cloud Txn lower (high data rate) layer. The system can have backward compatible future extensions, adding more lower layers for additional services without impact legacy services.

The interactive duty ratio changes between sub-converters are also avoided due to the fast recovery during load transition periods. Cross-regulation effect is thus minimized. The SIMO power converter is fabricated with 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS process. The input voltage is 3 V and two output voltages are regulated at 1.8 V and 1.2 V, respectively, with a switching frequency of 500 kHz. The peak efficiency is measured at 82.8% with 102-mW load power. A 50.3-ns transient response time is achieved with 270-mW load change. No observable cross-regulation is found during load transient measurements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast-Response Hybrid SIMO Power Converter with Adaptive Current Compensation and Minimized Cross-Regulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2014.2304497","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/6803076/06746125.pdf","startPage":"1242","endPage":"1255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2014.2304497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803076","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746125/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Fast-Response Hybrid SIMO Power Converter with Adaptive Current Compensation and Minimized Cross-Regulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6746125/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14251308","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast-Response Hybrid SIMO Power Converter with Adaptive Current Compensation and Minimized Cross-Regulation","sourcePdf":"jssc-ma-2304497-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159044S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6803076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6803076","articleId":"6746125","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6746128,"authors":[{"name":"Xiongbin Rao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE), The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6774528/6746128/6746128-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiongbin Rao (S'13) received the B.Eng. degree in electronics and information engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2010.","He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the Department of ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

However, most existing IA designs require full channel state information (CSI) at the transmitters, which could lead to significant CSI signaling overhead. There are two techniques, namely CSI quantization and CSI feedback filtering, that reduce CSI feedback overhead. In this paper, we consider IA processing with CSI feedback filtering in MIMO cellular networks. We introduce a novel metric, namely the feedback dimension, to quantify the first order CSI feedback cost associated with the CSI feedback filtering. The CSI feedback filtering poses several important challenges in IA processing. First, there is a hidden partial CSI knowledge constraint in IA precoder design, which cannot be handled using conventional IA design methodology. Furthermore, existing results on the feasibility conditions of IA cannot be applied due to the partial CSI knowledge. Finally, it is very challenging to find out how much CSI feedback is actually needed to support IA processing. We shall address the above challenges and propose a new IA feasibility condition under partial CSIT knowledge in MIMO cellular networks. Based on this, we consider the CSI feedback dimension minimization subject to the degrees of freedom requirements, and further propose an asymptotically optimal solution and derive closed-form trade-off results between the CSI feedback cost and IA performance in MIMO cellular networks.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2307283","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6774528/06746128.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2307283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774528","startPage":"2100","endPage":"2110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Alignment With Partial CSI Feedback in MIMO Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746128","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference Alignment With Partial CSI Feedback in MIMO Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746128/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"8","publicationDate":"April15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14180800","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6746128/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Alignment With Partial CSI Feedback in MIMO Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-rao-2307283-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084555S","chronDate":"April15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6774528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6774528","articleId":"6746128","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6746132,"authors":[{"name":"Sedigheh Hashemi","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6803076/6746132/6746132-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sedigheh Hashemi received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 2005 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 2012, all in electrical engineering.","She was a postdoctoral scholar in the Communication Circuits Laboratory at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 2013, focusing on the analysis and design of high-speed data converters.

The proposed technique is based on spectral expansions of the elements' constitutive equations (I-V characteristics) into polynomial chaos series and applies to arbitrary circuit components, both linear and nonlinear. By application of a stochastic Galerkin method, the stochastic problem is cast in terms of an augmented set of deterministic constitutive equations relating the voltage and current spectral coefficients. These new equations are given a circuit interpretation in terms of equivalent models that can be readily implemented in SPICE-type simulators, as such allowing to take full advantage of existing algorithms and available built-in models for complex devices, like diodes and MOSFETs. The pertinent statistical information of the entire nonlinear network is retrieved via a single simulation. This approach is both accurate and efficient with respect to traditional techniques, such as Monte Carlo sampling. Application examples, including the analysis of a diode rectifier, a CMOS logic gate and a low-noise amplifier, validate the methodology and conclude the paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

Due to the pulsating output power of the downstream inverter, an ac current at twice the output frequency, which is called second harmonic current (SHC), arises in the input side of the downstream inverter. This SHC will penetrate to the front-end dc-dc converter, leading to reduced conversion efficiency. This paper first analyzes the propagation mechanism of the SHC and load transient response of two-stage single-phase inverters from the viewpoint of output impedance. Then, based on the current mode control and load current feed forward, two control methods to achieve low SHC in the front-end dc-dc converter and fast dynamic performance during load transient are proposed in this paper. Finally, a 2-kW two-stage single-phase inverter prototype has been constructed and tested, and the experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control methods.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2307092","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6917239/06746166.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2307092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6917239","startPage":"1028","endPage":"1041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Reduction of Second Harmonic Current and Improvement of Dynamic Response for Two-Stage Single-Phase Inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746166","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Reduction of Second Harmonic Current and Improvement of Dynamic Response for Two-Stage Single-Phase Inverter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746166/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14648187","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6746166/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"50837003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Reduction of Second Harmonic Current and Improvement of Dynamic Response for Two-Stage Single-Phase Inverter","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhu-2307092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104582S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6917239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6917239","articleId":"6746166","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6746169,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Cheng","affiliation":["CSIRO Computational Informatics, Clayton South VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085416983"},{"name":"Zhuo Chen","affiliation":["CSIRO Computational Informatics, Clayton South VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhuo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278563800"},{"name":"Yun Rui","affiliation":["Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yun","lastName":"Rui","id":"37606353200"},{"name":"Y.

We find that the conventional precoder selection criteria are not applicable to the full stream transmission mode with linear [zero forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE)] receivers. To solve this issue, a novel singular value decomposition (SVD)-based precoder selection criterion optimizing the bit error rate (BER) performance is proposed in this paper. The proposed criterion features a unified structure for both linear receivers and it can be calculated based on fast matrix computation algorithms. Its effectiveness in the full stream transmission mode is verified by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2306985","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6923505/06746169.pdf","startPage":"4092","endPage":"4096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2306985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Limited Feedback Unitary Precoding for MIMO Full Stream Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746169/","displayDocTitle":"Limited Feedback Unitary Precoding for MIMO Full Stream Transmission","volume":"63","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665035","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6746169/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology","grantNumber":"2011ZX03001-007-03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61302093 and 61362013"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory of Southeast University","grantNumber":"2013D07"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Limited Feedback Unitary Precoding for MIMO Full Stream Transmission","sourcePdf":"tvt-guizani-2306985-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096089S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6923505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6923505","articleId":"6746169","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6746172,"authors":[{"name":"Amr A.

In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm for scheduling and spectrum allocation with the objective of maximizing the network's throughout subject to a delay constraint. During each time slot, the scheduling and spectrum allocation problems involve selecting a subset of links to be activated, and based on spectrum sensing outcomes, allocate the available resources to these links. This problem is addressed as an aggregate utility maximization problem. Since the throughput of any data flow is limited by the throughput of the weakest link along its end-to-end path, the utility of each flow is chosen as a function of this weakest link's throughput. The throughput and delay performance of the network are characterized using a queueing theoretic analysis, and throughput is maximized via the application of Lagrangian duality theory. The dual decomposition framework decouples the problem into a set of subproblems that can be solved locally, hence, it allows us to develop a scalable distributed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the fast convergence rates of the proposed algorithm, as well as significant performance gains compared to conventional design methods.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2013.82","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/6868326/06746172.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6868326","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2013.82","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","startPage":"1967","endPage":"1980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Throughput Maximization in Cognitive Radio Wireless Mesh Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746172","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Throughput Maximization in Cognitive Radio Wireless Mesh Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746172/","volume":"13","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6746172/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14485790","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Decentralized Throughput Maximization in Cognitive Radio Wireless Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-mohamed-82-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118744S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6868326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6868326","articleId":"6746172","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6746174,"authors":[{"name":"Botao Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6742656/6746174/6746174-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Botao Wang received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering, from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

However, it faces the challenges from inter and intraclass diversity, as well as distortions caused by viewpoints, poses, deformations, and so on. To solve object variations, this paper constructs a structure kernel and proposes a multiscale part-based model incorporating the discriminative power of kernels. The structure kernel would measure the resemblance of part-based objects in three aspects: 1) the global similarity term to measure the resemblance of the global visual appearance of relevant objects; 2) the part similarity term to measure the resemblance of the visual appearance of distinctive parts; and 3) the spatial similarity term to measure the resemblance of the spatial layout of parts. In essence, the deformation of parts in the structure kernel is penalized in a multiscale space with respect to horizontal displacement, vertical displacement, and scale difference. Part similarities are combined with different weights, which are optimized efficiently to maximize the intraclass similarities and minimize the interclass similarities by the normalized stochastic gradient ascent algorithm. In addition, the parameters of the structure kernel are learned during the training process with regard to the distribution of the data in a more discriminative way.

The robotic fish is composed of two links connected by an actuated joint; the frontal link is rigid and acts as the robotic fish body, while the rear link serves as the tail. The latter comprises a rigid element connected to a flexible caudal fin, whose underwater vibration is responsible for propulsion. The dynamics of the frontal link are described using Kirchhoff's equations of motion for rigid bodies in quiescent fluids. The tail vibration is modeled using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and the effect of the encompassing fluid is described using the Morison equation. The thrust production is assessed from static thrust data in terms of the fin-tip displacement; other salient model parameters are estimated through a nonlinear least squares technique. The model is validated against experimental data on circular and S-shaped trajectories. The model can be used for simulation, prediction, design optimization, and control, as it allows for the description of the robot's motion as a function of the unique input of the system, that is, the servomotor angle. Within the latter application, a heading control algorithm, in which the controller is tuned on the basis of the dynamic model, is presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6746185/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14863999","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"40","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Modeling of a Robotic Fish Propelled by a Compliant Tail","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CMMI-0745753"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Modeling of a Robotic Fish Propelled by a Compliant Tail","sourcePdf":"joe-porfiri-2294891-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138086S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"7005546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7005546","articleId":"6746185","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":6746186,"authors":[{"name":"Lingli Xia","affiliation":["Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6822663/6746186/6746186-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lingli Xia received the B.S. degree in electronics science and technology in 2005 from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, and the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics and solid-state electronics in 2010 from Fudan University, Shanghai, China.","She is currently a postdoctor in electrical engineering at Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA.

An efficiency tracking loop is proposed that adjusts the rectifier's threshold voltage to maximize the wireless harvesting operation, resulting in a minimum RF sensitivity better than -20 dBm at 904.5 MHz. Each SoC node is injection-locked and time-synchronized with the broadcasted RF basestation power (up to a sensitivity of -33 dBm) using an injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD). Hence, every sensor node is phase-locked with the basestation and all nodes can wirelessly transmit TDMA sensor data concurrently. Designed in a 65 nm-CMOS process, the fabricated sensor SoC contains the energy harvesting rectifier and bandgap, duty-cycled ADC, digital logic, as well as the multi-node wireless clock synchronization and MICS-band transmitter. For a broadcasted basestation power of 20 dBm (30 dBm), experimental measurements verify correct powering, sensor reading, and wireless data transfer for a distance of 3 m (9 m).

These techniques often employ execution offloading schemes that migrate a process between machines during its execution. In execution offloading, code regions to be executed on the server are decided statically or dynamically based on the complex analysis on execution time and process state transfer costs of every region. Expectedly, the transfer cost is a deciding factor for the success of execution offloading. According to our analysis, it is dominated by the total size of heap objects transferred over the network. But previous work did not try hard to minimize this size. Thus in this paper, we introduce novel techniques based on compiler code analysis that effectively reduce the transferred data size by transferring only the essential heap objects and the stack frames actually referenced in the server. The experiments exhibit that the reduced size positively influences not only the transfer time itself but also the overall effectiveness of execution offloading, and ultimately, improves the performance of our mobile cloud computing significantly in terms of execution time and energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2014.2307293","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/6913596/06746190.pdf","startPage":"2648","endPage":"2660","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2014.2307293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6913596","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Techniques to Minimize State Transfer Costs for Dynamic Execution Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746190/","displayDocTitle":"Techniques to Minimize State Transfer Costs for Dynamic Execution Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","volume":"13","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6746190/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2014","accessionNumber":"14648276","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Techniques to Minimize State Transfer Costs for Dynamic Execution Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tmc-paek-2307293-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065935S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6913596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6913596","articleId":"6746190","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6746191,"authors":[{"name":"Sina Lashgari","affiliation":["Cornell University, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Sina Lashgari received his B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology in 2010.

The converse builds upon our development of a general lemma that shows that, if two distributed transmitters employ linear strategies, the ratio of the dimensions of received linear subspaces at the two receivers cannot exceed 3/2, due to delayed CSIT. As a byproduct, we also apply this general lemma to the three-user interference channel with delayed CSIT, thereby deriving a new upper bound of 9/7 on its linear DoF.

The solution is based on the use of the file delivery over unidirectional transport (FLUTE) protocol in multicast networks, which reduce considerably the bandwidth when there are many users interested in the same contents. Specifically, the system proposed reduces the average download time of clients within the coverage area, thus improving the Quality of Experience. To that extent, clients send periodically feedback messages to the server reporting the losses they are experiencing. With this information, the server decides which is the optimum application layer-forward error correction (AL-FEC) code rate that minimizes the average download time, taking into account the channel bandwidth, and starts sending data with that code rate. The system proposed is evaluated in various scenarios, considering different distributions of losses in the coverage area.

The evolutions of the electrical variables are determined by the state-dependent switchings, which complicate the mathematical modeling of controlled power converters. Differently from the complementarity models previously presented in the literature, the model proposed in this paper allows to represent as a linear complementarity system also closed-loop power converters, without requiring the a priori knowledge of the converter modes. A model construction procedure, not dependent on the specific converter topology, is presented. The discretization of the continuous-time model allows to formulate mixed linear complementarity problems for the computation of the control-to-output frequency response and the evolutions of both transient and steady-state currents and voltages. As illustrative examples, Z-source, boost, and buck dc-dc power converters under voltage-mode control and current-mode control operating both in continuous and discontinuous conduction modes are considered.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6877756/06746199.pdf","startPage":"6821","endPage":"6835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2306975","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2306975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6877756","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Complementarity Model for Closed-Loop Power Converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit modeling","Vectors","Switches","Mathematical model","Computational modeling","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","DC-DC power convertors","electric current control","frequency response","semiconductor diodes","switches","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-loop power converters","complementarity model","linear circuits","diodes","controlled electronic switches","electrical variables","state-dependent switchings","controlled power converters","linear complementarity system","model construction procedure","continuous-time model","mixed linear complementarity problems","control-to-output frequency response","transient currents","steady-state currents","transient voltages","steady-state voltages","Z-source power converters","boost dc-dc power converters","buck dc-dc power converters","voltage-mode control","current-mode control","discontinuous conduction modes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circuit modeling","closed-loop systems","dc\u2013dc power conversion","discrete time systems","switching circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Complementarity Model for Closed-Loop Power Converters","volume":"29","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6746199/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14514059","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Complementarity Model for Closed-Loop Power Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-sessa-2306975-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091074S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6877756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6877756","articleId":"6746199","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6746203,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Yang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6923505/6746203/yang-2306986-small.gif","p":["\nPing Yang received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from the University of\nElectronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, where he is currently\nworking toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include multiple-input\u2013multiple-output systems, space\u2013time coding, and\ncommunication signal processing."]},"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Yang","id":"37575465800"},{"name":"Yue Xiao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6923505/6746203/xiao-2306986-small.gif","p":["\nYue Xiao received the Ph.D. degree in communication and information\nsystems from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2007.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

In this paper, we conceive new star-quadrature amplitude modulation (star-QAM)-aided SM schemes. Our goal is to minimize the system's average bit error probability (ABEP). More specifically, a new class of star-QAM constellations is introduced for SM, which is capable of flexibly adapting ring ratios of the amplitude levels. Then, under a specific MIMO configuration and a predetermined transmission rate, a simple and efficient ring-ratio optimization algorithm is proposed to minimize the ABEP. Moreover, to improve further the performance of our star-QAM-aided SM scheme, a diagonal precoding technique is proposed, and a low-complexity minimum-distance-based approach is conceived for extracting the precoding parameters. Our numerical results show that the proposed star-QAM-aided SM arrangement provides beneficial system performance improvements compared with the identical-throughput maximum-minimum distance (MMD) QAM and phase-shift keying (PSK) benchmarkers. Moreover, our precoding scheme is capable of further improving the attainable system performance at a modest feedback requirement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Star-QAM Signaling Constellations for Spatial Modulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2306986","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6923505/06746203.pdf","startPage":"3741","endPage":"3749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2306986","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Star-QAM Signaling Constellations for Spatial Modulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6746203/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665049","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chinese Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"KFKT-2012102"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61101101"},{"fundingName":"Foundation Project of the National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications","grantNumber":"9140C020404120C0201"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Star-QAM Signaling Constellations for Spatial Modulation","sourcePdf":"tvt-hanzo-2306986-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101411S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6923505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6923505","articleId":"6746203","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6746209,"authors":[{"name":"Liming Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Liming Wang (S'08\u2013M'11) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2006, M.S. degree in mathematics and Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago, both in 2011.

The gradient is with respect to the measurement matrix in a compressive-sensing setting, and mutual information is considered for signal recovery and classification. Existing gradient-of-mutual-information results for scalar Poisson models are recovered as special cases, as are known results for the vector Gaussian model. The Bregman-divergence generalization yields a Bregman matrix, and this matrix induces numerous matrix-valued metrics. The metrics associated with the Bregman matrix are detailed, as are its other properties. The Bregman matrix is also utilized to connect the relative entropy and mismatched minimum mean squared error. Two applications are considered: 1) compressive sensing with a Poisson measurement model and 2) compressive topic modeling for analysis of a document corpora (word-count data). In both of these settings, we use the developed theory to optimize the compressive measurement matrix, for signal recovery and classification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746209/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14264295","isOpenAccess":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6746209/","displayDocTitle":"A Bregman Matrix and the Gradient of Mutual Information for Vector Poisson and Gaussian Channels","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency through the KeCom Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Bregman Matrix and the Gradient of Mutual Information for Vector Poisson and Gaussian Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-carin-2307068-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152964S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6800061","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6800061","articleId":"6746209","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6746210,"authors":[{"name":"Weiqiang Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Radar Imaging and Microwave Photonics, College of Electronic and Information Engineering Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/6810833/6746210/6746210-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weiqiang Liu (S\u201910\u2013M\u201912) received the B.Sc. degree in information engineering from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), Nanjing, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the Queen's University Belfast (QUB), Belfast, U.K., in 2006 and 2012, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor in the College of Electronic and Information Engineering, NUAA.

Circuit designs in QCA have been extensively studied. However, how to properly evaluate the QCA circuits has not been carefully considered. To date, metrics and area-delay cost functions directly mapped from CMOS technology have been used to compare QCA designs, which is inappropriate due to the differences between these two technologies. In this paper, several cost metrics specifically aimed at QCA circuits are studied. It is found that delay, the number of QCA logic gates, and the number and type of crossovers, are important metrics that should be considered when comparing QCA designs. A family of new cost functions for QCA circuits is proposed. As fundamental components in QCA computing arithmetic, QCA adders are reviewed and evaluated with the proposed cost functions. By taking the new cost metrics into account, previous best adders become unattractive and it has been shown that different optimization goals lead to different \u201cbest\u201d adders.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2014.2306754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2014.2306754","startPage":"476","endPage":"487","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/6810833/06746210.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6810833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A First Step Toward Cost Functions for Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata Designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"A First Step Toward Cost Functions for Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata Designs","volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14281942","publicationDate":"May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6746210/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A First Step Toward Cost Functions for Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata Designs","sourcePdf":"tnano-liu-2306754-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098879S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6810833","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"6810833","articleId":"6746210","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":6746215,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Mo","affiliation":["Wireless Networking and Communications Group, The University of Texas, Austin, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6782402/6746215/6746215-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianhua Mo (s'12) received his BS and MS degree in Electronic Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2010 and 2013 respectively.

The relay acts as both an essential signal forwarder and a potential eavesdropper. Both two-phase and three-phase two-way relay strategies are considered. Our goal is to jointly optimize the source and relay beamformers for maximizing the secrecy sum rate of the two-way communications. We first derive the optimal relay beamformer structures. Then, iterative algorithms are proposed to find source and relay beamformers jointly based on alternating optimization. Furthermore, we conduct asymptotic analysis on the maximum secrecy sum-rate. Our analysis shows that when all transmit powers approach infinity, the two-phase two-way relay scheme achieves the maximum secrecy sum rate if the source beamformers are designed such that the received signals at the relay align in the same direction. This reveals an important advantage of signal alignment technique in against eavesdropping. It is also shown that if the source powers approach zero, the three-phase scheme performs the best while the two-phase scheme is even worse than direct transmission. Simulation results have verified the efficiency of the proposed secure beamforming algorithms as well as the analytical findings.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6782402/06746215.pdf","startPage":"2185","endPage":"2199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2307276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2307276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Beamforming for MIMO Two-Way Communications With an Untrusted Relay","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Array signal processing","Educational institutions","Security","MIMO","Physical layer","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","array signal processing","iterative methods","MIMO communication","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO two way communications","secure beamforming design","multiple antenna three node system","source nodes","untrusted relay node","signal forwarder","eavesdropper","optimal relay beamformer structures","iterative algorithms","asymptotic analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical layer security","signal alignment","two-way relaying","untrusted relay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Secure Beamforming for MIMO Two-Way Communications With an Untrusted Relay","volume":"62","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6746215/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14210072","dateOfInsertion":"02 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Beamforming for MIMO Two-Way Communications With an Untrusted Relay","sourcePdf":"tsp-tao-2307276-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161036S","chronDate":"May1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6782402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"6782402","articleId":"6746215","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6746217,"authors":[{"name":"Jose M.

Our algorithm starts by creating a set of putative correspondences which can contain a very large number of false correspondences, or outliers, in addition to a limited number of true correspondences (inliers). Next, we solve for correspondence by interpolating a vector field between the two point sets, which involves estimating a consensus of inlier points whose matching follows a nonparametric geometrical constraint. We formulate this a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of a Bayesian model with hidden/latent variables indicating whether matches in the putative set are outliers or inliers. We impose nonparametric geometrical constraints on the correspondence, as a prior distribution, using Tikhonov regularizers in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. MAP estimation is performed by the EM algorithm which by also estimating the variance of the prior model (initialized to a large value) is able to obtain good estimates very quickly (e.g., avoiding many of the local minima inherent in this formulation). We illustrate this method on data sets in 2D and 3D and demonstrate that it is robust to a very large number of outliers (even up to 90%). We also show that in the special case where there is an underlying parametric geometrical model (e.g., the epipolar line constraint) that we obtain better results than standard alternatives like RANSAC if a large number of outliers are present. This suggests a two-stage strategy, where we use our nonparametric model to reduce the size of the putative set and then apply a parametric variant of our approach to estimate the geometric parameters. Our algorithm is computationally efficient and we provide code for others to use it. In addition, our approach is general and can be applied to other problems, such as learning with a badly corrupted training data set.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","volume":"23","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"14142710","pubMedId":"24808341","publicationDate":"April 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6746218/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Point Matching via Vector Field Consensus","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273279"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Point Matching via Vector Field Consensus","sourcePdf":"tip-tian-2307478-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124513S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6742656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"328","xplore-issue":"6742656","articleId":"6746218","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6746226,"authors":[{"name":"Irshaad Fatadin","affiliation":["National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, U.K."],"firstName":"Irshaad","lastName":"Fatadin","id":"37393336700"},{"name":"David Ives","affiliation":["Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Ives","id":"37393336800"},{"name":"Seb J.

For effective saliency measurement, the original image is first simplified using adaptive color quantization and region segmentation to partition the image into a set of primitive regions. Then, three measures, i.e., global contrast, spatial sparsity, and object prior are integrated with regional similarities to generate the initial regional saliency for each primitive region. Next, a saliency-directed region merging approach with dynamic scale control scheme is proposed to generate the saliency tree, in which each leaf node represents a primitive region and each non-leaf node represents a non-primitive region generated during the region merging process. Finally, by exploiting a regional center-surround scheme based node selection criterion, a systematic saliency tree analysis including salient node selection, regional saliency adjustment and selection is performed to obtain final regional saliency measures and to derive the high-quality pixel-wise saliency map. Extensive experimental results on five datasets with pixel-wise ground truths demonstrate that the proposed saliency tree model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art saliency models.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6779706/06746240.pdf","startPage":"1937","endPage":"1952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2307434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2307434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6779706","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Saliency Tree: A Novel Saliency Detection Framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Merging","Image segmentation","Materials","Electronic mail","Histograms","Quantization (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image resolution","image segmentation","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["saliency tree generation","novel saliency detection framework","saliency measurement","adaptive color quantization","region segmentation","global contrast","spatial sparsity","object prior","regional similarities","initial regional saliency generation","primitive region","saliency-directed region merging approach","dynamic scale control scheme","nonleaf node","regional center-surround scheme","salient node selection criterion","systematic saliency tree analysis","regional saliency adjustment","regional saliency selection","high-quality pixel-wise saliency map"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Saliency tree","saliency detection","saliency model"]},{"kwd":["Saliency tree","saliency detection","saliency model","saliency map","regional saliency measure","region merging","salient node selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Saliency Tree: A Novel Saliency Detection Framework","volume":"23","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6746240/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14209101","pubMedId":"24710397","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Saliency Tree: A Novel Saliency Detection Framework","sourcePdf":"tip-liu-2307434-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120977S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6779706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"6779706","articleId":"6746240","onlineDate":"20 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6746245,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmet Gokceoglu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6746242/6746245/6746245-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmet Hasim Gokceoglu was born in Ankara, Turkey, in 1986.

Such receivers are, however, also very sensitive to various radio frequency (RF) impairments such as IQ imbalance, which can considerably limit the spectrum sensing capabilities. Most of the existing spectrum sensing studies in literature assume an ideal RF receiver and hence neglect the impacts of such practical RF hardware limitations. In this article, we study energy detection (ED) based spectrum sensing in both single-channel and multi-channel direct-conversion receiver scenarios impaired by IQ imbalance. With complex Gaussian primary user (PU) signal models, we first derive the detection and false alarm probabilities in closed-form for both receiver scenarios. The analytical results, confirmed through extensive simulations, show that while the single-channel receiver scenario is fairly robust to IQ imbalance, the wideband multi-channel sensing receiver is very sensitive to the image channel crosstalk induced by IQ imbalance. More specifically, it is shown that the false alarm probability of multi-channel energy detection increases significantly, compared to ideal RF receiver case, and the exact performance depends on the image channel power level and IQ imbalance values. In order to prevent such degradation in the ability to identify free spectrum, a waveform level interference cancellation method is then proposed to mitigate the image channel crosstalk. The optimum cancellation coefficient yielding interference-free signal is first derived, being also complemented with a practical coefficient sample estimator. An explicit condition is also derived for which the proposed cancellation scheme deploying the practical coefficient sample estimator provides performance gain in the sensing decisions compared to uncompensated energy detection. Extensive computer simulations with various signal and imbalance conditions are provided which demonstrate that the proposed enhanced energy detection can suppress the image channel crosstalk efficiently, yielding detection and false alarm probabilities essentially identical to those of an ideal RF receiver.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.1403001","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6746242/06746245.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"424","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.1403001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Detection under IQ Imbalance with Single- and Multi-Channel Direct-Conversion Receiver: Analysis and Mitigation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746245/","displayDocTitle":"Energy Detection under IQ Imbalance with Single- and Multi-Channel Direct-Conversion Receiver: Analysis and Mitigation","volume":"32","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14115580","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6746245/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Detection under IQ Imbalance with Single- and Multi-Channel Direct-Conversion Receiver: Analysis and Mitigation","sourcePdf":"411jsac0314gokceoglu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067698S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6746242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6746242","articleId":"6746245","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6746246,"authors":[{"name":"Xianghui Cao","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6746242/6746246/6746246-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xianghui Cao (S'08-M'11) received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in control science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.

It has been shown that the estimation performance strongly depends on the wireless communication quality. To enhance the estimation performance, we apply the cognitive radio technique to the system and propose a CHAnnel seNsing and switChing mEchanism (CHANCE) to explore opportunistic accessibility of multiple channels. We consider two types of wireless channels, i.e., one unlicensed channel which can be accessed freely and several licensed channels which have been pre-assigned to primary users. For the single-licensed-channel case, we develop a necessary condition for the estimation stability based on the physical process dynamics, channel quality and the channel sensing accuracy. This condition becomes also sufficient under certain conditions. We also derive the conditions under which the estimation performance is guaranteed to be improved by CHANCE. The above results are then extended to multi-licensed-channel cases. Simulations based on a particular linear system show that, the long-run mean estimation error covariance with CHANCE is at least 63% less than that without CHANCE. It is also shown that CHANCE outperforms the existing RANDOM mechanism in terms of estimation performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6746242/06746246.pdf","startPage":"489","endPage":"502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.1403002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.1403002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746246","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio Based State Estimation in Cyber-Physical Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Packet loss","Stability analysis","State estimation","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","covariance analysis","state estimation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio-based state estimation","cyber-physical systems","dynamical physical process","wireless sensor","remote state estimator","wireless communication quality","estimation performance","cognitive radio technique","channel sensing-switching mechanism","multiple-channel opportunistic accessibility","CHANCE","wireless channels","unlicensed channel","primary users","estimation stability","single-licensed-channel","physical process dynamics","channel quality","channel sensing accuracy","multilicensed-channel","linear system","long-run mean estimation error covariance","RANDOM mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","cyber physical system","state estimation","stability condition","performance bounds"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746246/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio Based State Estimation in Cyber-Physical Systems","volume":"32","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6746246/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14115567","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio Based State Estimation in Cyber-Physical Systems","sourcePdf":"489jsac0314cao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117822S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6746242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6746242","articleId":"6746246","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6746247,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY"],"bio":{"p":["Qiang Liu is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer engineering at Stony Brook University.

To study the multi-channel cooperative spectrum access, cooperation over single channel is investigated first, which involves a PU selecting the suitable SU and granting a period of access time to the selected SU as a reward, considering trustworthiness of SUs. The above procedure is modeled as a Stackelberg game, through which access time allocation and power allocation are obtained. Based on the above results, cooperation over multiple channels is studied from the perspectives of the primary network and secondary network, respectively. Two schemes are proposed accordingly: the primary network-centric matching (PCM) scheme and the secondary network-centric cluster-based (SCC) scheme. In PCM scheme, cooperating SU for each channel is determined to maximize the total utility of the primary network, which is formulated as a maximum weight matching problem. In SCC scheme, SUs first form a cluster to share the channel state information (CSI), and the best SUs are selected for cooperation with PUs over different channels to obtain the maximum aggregate access time for the secondary network. Then, SUs share the obtained resource using congestion game and quadrature signalling. Numerical results demonstrate that, with the proposed schemes, PUs can achieve higher throughput, while SUs can obtain longer average access time, compared with the random channel access approach.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.1403004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6746242/06746248.pdf","startPage":"516","endPage":"527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.1403004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Risk-Aware Cooperative Spectrum Access for Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746248/","displayDocTitle":"Risk-Aware Cooperative Spectrum Access for Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"32","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14115581","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6746248/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Risk-Aware Cooperative Spectrum Access for Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"516jsac0314zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08089S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6746242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6746242","articleId":"6746248","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6746249,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Xiong","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6746242/6746249/6746249-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cong Xiong received his B.S.E degree from the School of Telecommunication Engineering and M.S.E degree from the School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.

In this paper, we study energy-efficient opportunistic spectrum access strategies for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based CR network with multiple secondary users (SUs). Both worst EE and average EE are considered and optimized for different emphases and application scenarios. Since the original optimization issues belong to nonconvex integer combinatorial fractional program and are essentially NP-hard for an optimal solution, we use continuous and convex relaxation to modify the problems for somewhat better mathematical tractability. For the relaxed worst-EE-based spectrum access problem, we first demonstrate the joint quasiconcavity of EE on subchannel and power allocation matrices and then develop a framework to find the optimal solution based on efficient root finding and convex optimization. We also develop a low-complexity alternative for suboptimal solution. The relaxed average-EE-based spectrum access problem is still NP-hard and may have many local optima. We first transform the problem into an equivalent form and introduce a general concave envelope based branch-and-bound (B&B) approach to find the global optimal solution. We then exploit the underlying properties of the energy-efficient transmission to speed up the convergence of the B&B approach. Besides, we develop a low-complexity heuristic approach to find a suboptimal solution. Simulation results show that the energy-efficient spectrum access strategies significantly boost EE compared with the conventional spectral-efficient spectrum access ones while the low-complexity suboptimal approaches can well balance the performance and complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radios","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.1403005","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6746242/06746249.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.1403005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746249/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radios","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6746249/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14115563","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Spectrum Access in Cognitive Radios","sourcePdf":"550jsac0314xiong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080417S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6746242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6746242","articleId":"6746249","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6746250,"authors":[{"name":"Ryan K.

This paper studies the joint optimization problem for a spectrum pooling system with both PUs and SUs. We develop a novel hierarchical game theoretic model which consists of an overlapped coalition formation game model to analyze the pricing cooperation/competition strategy among PUs and a non-cooperative game model to investigate the resource competition among SUs. These two game models are interrelated in a hierarchical game structure, in which we also study the interaction between SUs and PUs. Our model does not require SUs to have information about spectrum access scheduling of PUs. Furthermore, we propose a simple distributed joint optimization algorithm that can optimize the coalition formation of PUs as well as the sub-band allocation and transmit powers of SUs. To study different fairness criteria and their effects on the payoff divisions among PUs, we derive the optimal payoff division schemes of two popular fairness criteria, namely Nash bargaining solution and Shapley value fairness.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746242","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2014.1403007","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6746242/06746251.pdf","startPage":"572","endPage":"588","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2014.1403007","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secondary Users Entering the Pool: A Joint Optimization Framework for Spectrum Pooling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Secondary Users Entering the Pool: A Joint Optimization Framework for Spectrum Pooling","volume":"32","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6746251/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14115562","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746251/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secondary Users Entering the Pool: A Joint Optimization Framework for Spectrum Pooling","sourcePdf":"572jsac0314xiao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096705S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6746242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6746242","articleId":"6746251","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6746321,"authors":[{"name":"Brett Byram","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/6746310/6746321/6746321-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Brett Byram received the B.S. degree in biomedical engineering and math from Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, in 2004.

Additionally, based on recent studies, multipath scattering also causes significant image degradation. To reduce degradation from both sources, we propose a model-based signal decomposition scheme. The proposed algorithm identifies spatial frequency signatures to decompose received wavefronts into their most significant scattering sources. Scattering sources originating from a region of interest are used to reconstruct decluttered wavefronts, which are beamformed into decluttered RF scan lines or A-lines. To test the algorithm, ultrasound system channel data were acquired during liver scans from 8 patients. Multiple data sets were acquired from each patient, with 55 total data sets, 43 of which had identifiable hypoechoic regions on normal B-mode images. The data sets with identifiable hypoechoic regions were analyzed. The results show the decluttered B-mode images have an average improvement in contrast over normal images of 7.3 \u00b1 4.6 dB. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) changed little on average between normal and decluttered Bmode, -0.4 \u00b1 5.9 dB. The in vivo speckle SNR decreased; the change was -0.65 \u00b1 0.28. Phantom speckle SNR also decreased, but only by -0.40 \u00b1 0.03.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/6746310/06746321.pdf","startPage":"428","endPage":"440","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2014.2928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2014.2928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746310","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasonic multipath and beamforming clutter reduction: a chirp model approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Transducers","Array signal processing","Clutter","Degradation","Nonhomogeneous media","In vivo"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomedical transducers","biomedical ultrasonics","data acquisition","image reconstruction","liver","medical image processing","phantoms","speckle","ultrasonic imaging","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic multipath scattering","beamforming clutter reduction","chirp model approach","in vivo ultrasonic imaging","transducer arrays","image degradation","beamforming limitations","diffraction-limited beamforming","beamforming degradation","tissue inhomogeneity","model-based signal decomposition scheme","spatial frequency signatures","received wavefront decomposition","decluttered wavefront reconstruction","decluttered RF scan lines","decluttered RF A-lines","ultrasound system channel data acquisition","liver scans","hypoechoic regions","normal B-mode images","contrast-to-noise ratio","in vivo speckle SNR","phantom speckle SNR"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Computer Simulation","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Models, Theoretical","Phantoms, Imaging","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Ultrasonography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746321/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic multipath and beamforming clutter reduction: a chirp model approach","volume":"61","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6746321/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14128364","pubMedId":"24569248","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic multipath and beamforming clutter reduction: a chirp model approach","sourcePdf":"t1430428.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072201S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"6746310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6746310","articleId":"6746321","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6746328,"authors":[{"name":"Sivaram N.

Sparse array element configurations are required to fully exploit the potential benefits of 2-D phased arrays. This paper applies the conformal mapping technique as a means of designing sparse 2-D array layouts for NDE applications. Modeling using both Huygens' field prediction theory and 2-D fast Fourier transformation is employed to study the resulting new structure. A conformal power map was used that, for fixed beam width, was shown in simulations to have a greater contrast than rectangular or random arrays. A prototype aperiodic 2-D array configuration for direct contact operation in steel, with operational frequency ~3 MHz, was designed using the array design principle described in this paper.

Genetic algorithms have been used recently for prototype selection and showed good performance, however, they have some drawbacks such as the deteriorated running effect, slow convergence for the large datasets. The goal of designing good prototype selection algorithm is to maximize prediction classification accuracy and minimize the reduction ratio simultaneously. According to this goal, a two objective optimization model is set up for prototype selection problem. To make the model easier to be solved, the model is transformed to a single objective optimization model by the division of the two objectives. To solve the problem efficiently, a new prototype selection algorithm based on genetic algorithm and the divide-and-conquer partition is presented. The divide-and-conquer partition can divide the whole dataset into some random subsets, and thus make the problems more easier. Then, the genetic algorithm is specifically designed on these divided random subsets. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can obtain smaller reduction ratio and higher classification efficiency, or at least comparable to those of some existing compared algorithms. This illustrates that the proposed algorithm is an expedient method in design nearest neighbor classifiers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746398/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14128843","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6746398/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2014","conferenceDate":"14-15 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Nearest Prototype Selection Algorithm Using Multi-objective Optimization and Partition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nearest Prototype Selection Algorithm Using Multi-objective Optimization and Partition","confLoc":"Emeishan, China","sourcePdf":"2548a264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068952S","chronDate":"14-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6733782","isNumber":"6746335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6733782","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6746335","articleId":"6746398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6746411,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Long","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Long","id":"37086749115"},{"name":"Lan Yuqing","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Yuqing","id":"37544115700"},{"name":"Xia Qingxin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xia","lastName":"Qingxin","id":"37086749689"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2549-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2548-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6746411","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1296},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Cloud computing","Power demand","Resource management","Servers","Educational institutions","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","digital simulation","power aware computing","profitability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CloudSim","cloud computing environment","future Internet of services","service providers","user requirement","energy consumption","energy-efficiency mechanism","datacenter","profit-making applications","cloud infrastructure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloudsim","cloud computing","simulation","energy effective","green computing"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing will be a major technology in the development of the future Internet of Services. Service providers want to remove the bottle neck of the cloud computing system in order to satisfy user requirement. And in order to save energy consumption they also need to apply new energy-efficiency mechanism and observe its effects on a data center. As it is difficult to test new mechanism in real cloud computing environment and researchers often cannot reach the real cloud environment, simulation to model the mechanism and evaluate the results is necessary. Simulating a data center avoids spending time and effort to configure a real testing environment. Moreover, as real machines are not used for testing purposes, their computational power can be allocated to profit-making applications. This paper introduces a simulation framework called CloudSim which provides simulation, power to manage services and modeling of cloud infrastructure. And we have also discussed about how to extend it to simulation your own mechanism in cloud computing.","doi":"10.1109/CIS.2013.75","publicationTitle":"2013 Ninth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Ninth International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/6733782/6746335/06746411.pdf","startPage":"323","endPage":"328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIS.2013.75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using CloudSim to Model and Simulate Cloud Computing Environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746411","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746411/","displayDocTitle":"Using CloudSim to Model and Simulate Cloud Computing Environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14128980","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6746411/","conferenceDate":"14-15 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using CloudSim to Model and Simulate Cloud Computing Environment","confLoc":"Emeishan, China","sourcePdf":"2548a323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073989S","chronDate":"14-15 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6733782","isNumber":"6746335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6733782","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6746335","articleId":"6746411","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6746415,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Xin Ling","affiliation":["School of Sciences South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wei-Xin","lastName":"Ling","id":"38237965600"},{"name":"Zhen Xing","affiliation":["School of Sciences South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Xing","id":"37086776370"},{"name":"Zhuo-Ming Chen","affiliation":["The Centre of Language Disorder, The First Affiliated Hospital Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zhuo-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086187806"},{"name":"Da-Jun Tang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Da-Jun","lastName":"Tang","id":"37086776456"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2549-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2548-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6746415","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Fuzzy systems","Pattern recognition","Sociology","Statistics","Iris recognition","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","signal classification","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy classifier design","genetic algorithm","Chinese vowel recognition","fuzzy pattern recognition","GA-FPC","optimization method","classification rate","recognition accuracy","UCI datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","fuzzy membership function","classifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746415","abstract":"This paper studies the structure and algorithm of fuzzy pattern recognition, and proposes some improvements with its inherent limitations.

In this paper, the traditional classification scheme of neural network is adapted to learn ordinal ranks. The model proposed imposes monotonicity constraints on the weights connecting the hidden layer with the output layer. To do so, the weights are transcribed using padding variables. This reformulation leads to the so-called inequality constrained least squares (ICLS) problem. Its numerical solution can be obtained by several iterative methods, for example, trust region or line search algorithms. In this proposal, the optimum is determined analytically according to the closed-form solution of the ICLS problem estimated from the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions. Furthermore, following the guidelines of the extreme learning machine framework, the weights connecting the input and the hidden layers are randomly generated, so the final model estimates all its parameters without iterative tuning. The model proposed achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art neural networks methods for OR.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2304976","startPage":"2075","endPage":"2085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2304976","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6924821","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6924821/06746640.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ordinal Neural Networks Without Iterative Tuning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746640/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Ordinal Neural Networks Without Iterative Tuning","volume":"25","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6746640/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14665098","pubMedId":"25330430","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ordinal Neural Networks Without Iterative Tuning","sourcePdf":"tnnls-fernandeznavarro-2304976-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105008S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6924821","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6924821","articleId":"6746640","onlineDate":"21 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6746642,"authors":[{"name":"JianHui Wu","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"JianHui","lastName":"Wu","id":"37291828800"},{"name":"JiaFeng Zhu","affiliation":["National ASIC System Engineering Research Center, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"JiaFeng","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37065800100"},{"name":"YingCheng Xia","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"YingCheng","lastName":"Xia","id":"37086628699"},{"name":"Na Bai","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Anhui University, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Bai","id":"38242018800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6746642","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":848},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746642","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Standards","Random access memory","Quantization (signal)","Inverters","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","CMOS memory circuits","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS technology","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company","SRAM access time","timing addition circuit","RBL delay","replica cells","static random access memory","SRAM sense amplifiers","timing variation","multiple-stage parallel replica-bitline delay addition technique","voltage 0.8 V","size 65 nm","storage capacity 16 Kbit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Process variation","replica-bitline (RBL) delay","sense amplifier (SA)","static random access memory (SRAM)","timing variation"]},{"kwd":["Process variation","replica-bitline (RBL) delay","sense amplifier (SA)","static random access memory (SRAM)","timing variation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2014.2304893","endPage":"268","startPage":"264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/6798683/06746642.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2014.2304893","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6798683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiple-Stage Parallel Replica-Bitline Delay Addition Technique for Reducing Timing Variation of SRAM Sense Amplifiers","abstract":"A multiple-stage parallel replica-bitline (RBL) delay addition technique for reducing the timing variation of static random access memory (SRAM) sense amplifiers (SAs) is proposed.

An eavesdropper which can intercept the data transmission from both the source and relay nodes is considered to threaten the security of transmission. Finite size data buffers are assumed to be available at every relay in order to avoid having to select concurrently the best source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links. A new max-ratio relay selection policy is proposed to optimize the secrecy transmission by considering all the possible source-to-relay and relay-to-destination links and selecting the relay having the link which maximizes the signal to eavesdropper channel gain ratio. Two cases are considered in terms of knowledge of the eavesdropper channel strengths: exact and average gains, respectively. Closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability for both cases are obtained, which are verified by simulations. The proposed max-ratio relay selection scheme is shown to outperform one based on a max-min-ratio relay scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746659/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","volume":"9","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14155814","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6746659/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Max-Ratio Relay Selection in Secure Buffer-Aided Cooperative Wireless Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K014307/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Max-Ratio Relay Selection in Secure Buffer-Aided Cooperative Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tifs-chen-2307672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090177S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6755552","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"6755552","articleId":"6746659","onlineDate":"21 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6746665,"authors":[{"name":"Jerdvisanop Chakarothai","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6819486/6746665/6746665-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jerdvisanop Chakarothai (S\u201906\u2013M\u201910) received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Akita University, Japan, in 2003, and the M.E. and D.E. degrees from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 2005 and 2010, respectively, both in electrical and communication engineering.","He was a Research Associate at Tohoku University in 2010.

First, the RC with a dipole or a helical antenna is designed numerically to function properly at 2 GHz.

All subsystems within these MIMO nonlinear systems are of completely nonaffine pure-feedback form and allowed to have different orders. To deal with the nonaffine appearance of the control variables, the mean value theorem is employed to transform the systems into a block-triangular strict-feedback form with control coefficients being couplings among various inputs and outputs. A systematic procedure is proposed for the design of a new singularity-free adaptive neural tracking control strategy. Such a design procedure can remove the couplings among subsystems and hence avoids the possible circular control construction problem. As a consequence, all the signals in the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded.

At these frequency bands, rain attenuation is the dominant fading mechanism. In this paper, a novel channel model, a synthesizer for generating rain attenuation time series for satellite links operating at 10GHz and above is presented. The proposed channel model modifies Maseng-Bakken (M-B) model since it generates rain attenuation time series that follow the Weibull distribution. The new stochastic dynamic model is based on the first-order Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and considers rain attenuation induced on a slant path as a Weibull-based stochastic process. Moreover, the theoretical expressions for the computation of the exceedance probability of hitting time random variable are presented. The hitting time statistics may be employed for the optimum design of Fade Mitigation Techniques (FMTs). The synthesizer is verified in terms of the exceedance probability and the theoretical CCDF of hitting time comparing to these derived from the simulations in the numerical results section.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6798887/06746728.pdf","startPage":"568","endPage":"571","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.013114.131950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.013114.131950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6798887","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6746728","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Model for Satellite Communication Links Above 10GHz Based on Weibull Distribution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Attenuation","Rain","Weibull distribution","Time series analysis","Stochastic processes","Synthesizers","Satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential equations","fading","rain","satellite links","time series","tropospheric electromagnetic wave propagation","Weibull distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCDF","probability","fade mitigation techniques","hitting time statistics","hitting time random variable","first-order stochastic differential equations","stochastic dynamic model","Maseng-Bakken model","rain attenuation time series","frequency bands","satellite communication networks","Weibull distribution","satellite communication links","channel model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Rain attenuation","satellite communications","Weibull distribution","stochastic differential equations","hitting time statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Channel Model for Satellite Communication Links Above 10GHz Based on Weibull Distribution","volume":"18","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6746728/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14239278","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Model for Satellite Communication Links Above 10GHz Based on Weibull Distribution","sourcePdf":"568-cl1404-sotir.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069749S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6798887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6798887","articleId":"6746728","onlineDate":"21 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6746730,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Macau, Macau"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086643565"},{"name":"Shaodan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Macau, Macau"],"firstName":"Shaodan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37280187300"},{"name":"C.

The object to be localized is passive, i.e., it is neither a transmitter nor a receiver. Unlike prior TOA-based algorithms, no perfect synchronization between the transceivers is assumed here. A two-step linear algorithm is proposed to jointly estimate the location of the passive object and the unknown time offset between the transceivers. The Bayesian Cramer-Rao lower bound (BCRB) for quasi-synchronous networks is then given for comparison.

The new method is composed of two parts. The first approach proposed is based on mapping the panorama generation problem onto a Markov Random Field (MRF) and then estimating posterior probabilities from initial likelihoods. The novelty of approach is based on extracting the prior evidence from the registration information of multiple cameras and estimating expected value on an undirected graph. The second part of the method is a geometrical approach targeting a better estimation for the initial priors, which is also not applied before. The aim of both approaches is to decrease the parallax errors and ghosting effects which occur due to the nature of multi camera systems. It is shown that instead of directly using independent intensity coefficients extracted from registration information, applying a neighborhood based local probability distribution for each pixel of panorama utilizing the registration information as prior gives better results. Visual comparisons are provided to show the achieved quality enhancement in terms of seamless and more natural panoramic image with less ghosting effects. Since the registration priors are used effectively with a single iteration step in a 4 connected neighborhood, the need for an intensity based loopy and iterative inference method is prohibited. Hence, the proposed methods are suitable for real-time hardware implementation. A hardware implementation of the method for real-time operation is proposed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746787/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14129047","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6746787/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2014","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Spherical Panorama Construction Using Multi Sensor Registration Priors and Its Real-Time Hardware","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spherical Panorama Construction Using Multi Sensor Registration Priors and Its Real-Time Hardware","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5140a171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047688S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6744523","isNumber":"6746450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6744523","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6746450","articleId":"6746787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6746799,"authors":[{"name":"Timothy M.

Different search paradigms such as text search, query-by-example, or query-by-sketch need to be seamlessly combined and integrated to support different information needs and to allow users to start (and subsequently refine) queries with any type of object. In this paper, we present QUEST (Query by Example, Sketch and Text), a novel flexible multi-modal content-based image retrieval (CBIR) framework. QUEST seamlessly integrates and blends multiple modes of image retrieval, thereby accumulating the strengths of each individual mode. Moreover, it provides several implementations of the different query modes and allows users to select, combine and even superimpose the mode(s) most appropriate for each search task. The combination of search paradigms is by itself done in a very flexible way: either sequentially, where one query mode starts with the result set of the previous one (i.e., for incrementally refining and/or extending a query) or by supporting different paradigms at the same time (e.g., creating an artificial query image by superimposing a query image with a sketch, thereby directly integrating query-by-example and query-by-sketch). We present the overall architecture of QUEST and the dynamic combination and integration of the query modes it supports. Furthermore, we provide first evaluation results that show the effectiveness and the gain in efficiency that can be achieved with the combination of different search modes in QUEST.","doi":"10.1109/ISM.2013.84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISM.2013.84","startPage":"433","endPage":"438","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6744523/6746450/06746836.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QUEST: Towards a Multi-modal CBIR Framework Combining Query-by-Example, Query-by-Sketch, and Text Search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"QUEST: Towards a Multi-modal CBIR Framework Combining Query-by-Example, Query-by-Sketch, and Text Search","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6746836/","accessionNumber":"14129089","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746836/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QUEST: Towards a Multi-modal CBIR Framework Combining Query-by-Example, Query-by-Sketch, and Text Search","confLoc":"Anaheim, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"5140a433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056933S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6744523","isNumber":"6746450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6744523","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6746450","articleId":"6746836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6746852,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo-Shiuan Peng","affiliation":["Dept. of Power Mechanical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuo-Shiuan","lastName":"Peng","id":"37086722884"},{"name":"Fang-Cheng Lin","affiliation":["Dept. of Photonics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fang-Cheng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37398409900"},{"name":"Yi-Pai Huang","affiliation":["Dept. of Photonics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yi-Pai","lastName":"Huang","id":"37278785100"},{"name":"Han-Ping D.

Developing an automatic computer-aided detection system to alleviate the burden of clinicians is required. In this paper, we proposed a new hookworm image detection algorithm. A new gradient space, named Hybrid Color Gradient (HCG) for hookworm detection is developed by analyzing the characteristics of hookworm infection images.

Continuous monitoring of patient's postures in the bed can be helpful for caregivers in order to keep track of patient's movements and quality of their repositioning during a day. This information allows hospitals to plan an effective repositioning schedule for each patient. In this paper, a high speed and robust posture classification algorithm is proposed that can be employed in any pervasive patient's monitoring system. First, a whole-body pressure image is recorded using a commercial pressure mat system. Image enhancement is then applied to the raw pressure images and a binary signature for each different posture is constructed. Finally, using a binary pattern matching technique, a given posture can be classified to one of the known posture classes. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm is able to predict in-bed postures with more than 97% average accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreNote":"Please be advised that the paper you have accessed is a draft of the final paper that was presented at the conference.

Sample genes (dimensionalities) play a fundamental role in classification. Feature selection technologies used to reduce gene numbers and find informative genes have been presented in recent years. But the performance of feature selection in gene classification research is still controversial. In this study, a classification algorithm based on the two-layer particle swarm optimization (TLPSO) is established to classify the uncertain training sample sets obtained from three gene expression datasets which contain the leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and multi-class tumors dataset respectively with the exponential increasing of gene numbers. Compared the results obtained by using the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the classification stability and accuracy of the results based on the proposed TLPSO classification algorithm is improved significantly and more information to clinicians for choosing more appropriate treatment can extracted.","doi":"10.1109/BMEI.2013.6746997","startPage":"524","endPage":"529","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 6th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732178/6746887/06746997.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 6th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2013.6746997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative study of two-layer particle swarm optimization and particle swarm optimization in classification for tumor gene expression data with different dimensionalities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Tumors","Training","Prediction algorithms","Accuracy","Particle swarm optimization","Gene expression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood","cancer","feature selection","genetic algorithms","genetics","medical computing","particle swarm optimisation","pattern classification","tumours"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification accuracy","classification stability","multiclass tumors dataset","diffuse large B cell lymphoma","leukemia","uncertain training sample sets","classification algorithm","gene number reduction","feature selection technologies","molecular biology level","tumor samples","tumor gene expression data classification","two-layer particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["classification","comparison","tumor","gene","TLPSO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6746997/","xploreNote":"Please be advised that the paper you have accessed is a draft of the final paper that was presented at the conference.

It has been found that the individual neural networks created by NCL are less different than those by BEL although NCL often displayed better performance than BEL on noisy data sets.

In this paper, we propose to jointly optimize the durations for spectrum sensing and data transmission by maximizing the throughput while keeping the probabilities of interference to a primary user (PU) and false alarm under certain thresholds. The optimal sensing and transmission durations are obtained by the differential evolution algorithm. Numerical results show that the optimal time durations for sensing and transmission vary under different thresholds for interference probability to the PU and different primary activity distributions.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2013.6747048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746887","startPage":"792","endPage":"796","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 6th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732178/6746887/06747048.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint design of spectrum sensing and data transmission for cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreNote":"Please be advised that the paper you have accessed is a draft of the final paper that was presented at the conference.

However, tumors sometimes cannot be removed clearly with LT in limited conditions. The therapeutic efficiency of HCC is often evaluated by comparing 2D fusion images of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between the preoperation and the postoperation. However, judgment about whether the tumors exist in the treated margin after LT by using 2D slices sometimes is difficult. It is desirable to develop a suitable image registration algorithm to automatically align the two volumes in order to transform the treated margin of the postoperative volume to the tumor of the preoperative volume to assess the therapeutic efficiency after treatment of HCC. With taking these into consideration, this paper proposed an automatic 3D fusion imaging approach for medical image by using the nonrigid registration method that aligning an ablative margin - that is the treated margin after LT, onto the locations of HCC. In our registration algorithm, a rigid global transformation combined with localized B-spline is used to estimate the significant nonrigid motions of the liver between before and after LT. Our proposed approach can ensure the feasibility, the accuracy and the efficacy to assess the treated margin for HCC. Furthermore, this method can be adapted to register multi-modality medical images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing the difference criterions of fusion evaluation on medical images. The results clearly indicate that our method extremely useful in the evaluation of the treated margin, in addition, it remain the motion and local deformation of the volume.","doi":"10.1109/BMEI.2013.6747052","publicationTitle":"2013 6th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 6th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732178/6746887/06747052.pdf","startPage":"811","endPage":"816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2013.6747052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonrigid registration for evaluating locoregional therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2013","xploreNote":"Please be advised that the paper you have accessed is a draft of the final paper that was presented at the conference.

In this research, we aim to construct a auto-recognition system of food images and keep the daily food-log records which will contribute to manage dietary life. With the easily available food images taken by mobile phone, it prospects to give the insight about the daily dietary of users with our constructed food recognition system. In order to achieve the acceptable recognition performance of the food images, we propose to apply a sparse model for coding a local descriptor extracted from the food images. Sparse coding: an extension of vector quantization for local descriptors, which is popularly used in Bag-of-Features (BoF) for image representation in generic object recognition, can represent the local descriptors more efficient, and then abtain more discriminant feature for food image representation. Moreover, in order to introduce spatial information, a hierarchic spatial structure is explored to extract the feature based sparse model. Experiments validate that the proposed strategy can greatly improve the recognition rates compared with the conventional BOF model on two databases: our constructed RFID and the public PFID.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 6th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6732178/6746887/06747060.pdf","startPage":"851","endPage":"855","publicationTitle":"2013 6th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics","doi":"10.1109/BMEI.2013.6747060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BMEI.2013.6747060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6746887","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747060","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse model in hierarchic spatial structure for food image recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Image recognition","Educational institutions","Image representation","Radiofrequency identification","Visualization","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical communication","feature extraction","image coding","image representation","medical image processing","mobile radio","object recognition","radiofrequency identification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["support vector machines","public PFID","RFID","hierarchic spatial structure","food image representation","generic object recognition","bag-of-feature extration","local descriptors","vector quantization","sparse coding model","food-log system","food image extraction","mobile phone","food image autorecognition system","liver trouble","heart stroke","unhealthy diets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["formatting","sparse coding","food","image recognation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747060/","xploreNote":"Please be advised that the paper you have accessed is a draft of the final paper that was presented at the conference.

However, such potentially large execution histories do not include any hints to failure causes. For that reason, developers are forced to ascertain unexpected state properties and wrong behavior completely on their own. Without deep program understanding, back-in-time debugging can end in countless and difficult questions about possible failure causes that consume a lot of time for following failures back to their root causes. In this paper, we present state navigation as a debugging guide that highlights unexpected state properties along execution histories. After deriving common object properties from the expected behavior of passing test cases, we generate likely invariants, compare them with the failing run, and map differences as state anomalies to the past execution. So, developers obtain a common thread through the large amount of run-time data which helps them to answer what causes the observable failure. We implement our completely automatic state navigation as part of our test-driven fault navigation and its Path tools framework. To evaluate our approach, we observe eight developers during debugging four non-trivial failures. As a result, we find out that our state navigation is able to aid developers and to decrease the required time for localizing the root cause of a failure.","doi":"10.1109/CSMR-WCRE.2014.6747162","publicationTitle":"2014 Software Evolution Week - IEEE Conference on Software Maintenance, Reengineering, and Reverse Engineering (CSMR-WCRE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Software Evolution Week - IEEE Conference on Software Maintenance, Reengineering, and Reverse Engineering (CSMR-WCRE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6736725/6747152/06747162.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSMR-WCRE.2014.6747162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747152","startPage":"124","endPage":"133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Follow the path: Debugging state anomalies along execution histories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747162","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Follow the path: Debugging state anomalies along execution histories","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Feb. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747162/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-6 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14130236","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6747162/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Follow the path: Debugging state anomalies along execution histories","confLoc":"Antwerp, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p124perscheid.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078991S","chronDate":"3-6 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6736725","isNumber":"6747152","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6736725","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6747152","articleId":"6747162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6747210,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Ge","affiliation":["NC State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Ge","id":"37892966100"},{"name":"David Shepherd","affiliation":["ABB Inc, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Shepherd","id":"38300312200"},{"name":"Kostadin Damevski","affiliation":["Virginia State University, Petersburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Kostadin","lastName":"Damevski","id":"37427233100"},{"name":"Emerson Murphy-Hill","affiliation":["NC State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Emerson","lastName":"Murphy-Hill","id":"38330554900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3752-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6747210","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":58},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Thesauri","Software","Indexing","Software engineering","Tag clouds","Search engines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["query processing","recommender systems","software maintenance","software tools"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information retrieval algorithms","relevant code snippet retrieval","local codebase","local code search tool","Sando search tool","query recommendation techniques"]}],"abstract":"Developers spend a significant amount of time searching their local codebase.

Often different words are used to express the same meaning and thus measuring similarities using exact matching of words is insufficient. To solve this problem, past studies have shown the need to measure the similarities between pairs of words. To meet this need, the natural language processing community has built WordNet which is a manually constructed lexical database that records semantic relations among words and can be used to measure how similar two words are. However, WordNet is a general purpose resource, and often does not contain software-specific words. Also, the meanings of words in WordNet are often different than when they are used in software engineering context. Thus, there is a need for a software-specific WordNet-like resource that can measure similarities of words. In this work, we propose an automated approach that builds a software-specific WordNet like resource, named WordSim\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">SE</sup>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DB</sub>\n, by leveraging the textual contents of posts in StackOverflow. Our approach measures the similarity of words by computing the similarities of the weighted co-occurrences of these words with three types of words in the textual corpus. We have evaluated our approach on a set of software-specific words and compared our approach with an existing WordNet-based technique (WordNet\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">res</sup>\n) to return top-k most similar words.

In this paper, we extend the research over BS switching operations, which should match up with traffic load variations. Instead of depending on the dynamic traffic loads which are still quite challenging to precisely forecast, we firstly formulate the traffic variations as a Markov decision process. Afterwards, in order to foresightedly minimize the energy consumption of RANs, we design a reinforcement learning framework based BS switching operation scheme. Furthermore, to speed up the ongoing learning process, a transfer actor-critic algorithm (TACT), which utilizes the transferred learning expertise in historical periods or neighboring regions, is proposed and provably converges.

In this paper, we propose a non-uniform SCN deployment scheme. The small cell base stations (BSs) in this scheme will not be utilized in the region within a prescribed distance away from any macrocell BSs, defined as the inner region. Based upon the analytical framework provided in this work, the downlink coverage and single user throughput are precisely characterized. Provided that the inner region size is appropriately chosen, we find that the proposed non-uniform SCN deployment scheme can maintain the same level of cellular coverage performance even with 50% less small cell BSs used than the uniform SCN deployment, which is commonly considered in the literature. Furthermore, both the coverage and the single user throughput performance will significantly benefit from the proposed scheme, if its average small cell density is kept identical to the uniform SCN deployment. This work demonstrates the benefits obtained from a simple non-uniform SCN deployment, thus highlighting the importance of deploying small cells selectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06747281.pdf","startPage":"2047","endPage":"2059","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.022014.130855","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.022014.130855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage and Throughput Analysis with a Non-Uniform Small Cell Deployment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Macrocell networks","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniform small cell deployment","data-traffic demand","SCN deployment scheme","BS","analytical framework","downlink coverage","cellular coverage performance","single user throughput performance","small cell density"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Small cell networks","non-uniform deployment","coverage","throughput","stochastic geometry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Coverage and Throughput Analysis with a Non-Uniform Small Cell Deployment","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6747281/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252185","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage and Throughput Analysis with a Non-Uniform Small Cell Deployment","sourcePdf":"2047-tw1404-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070935S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6747281","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6747282,"authors":[{"name":"Tianming Li","affiliation":["WINLAB, Rutgers University, North Brunswick, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6747282/6747282-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tianming Li received his B.E. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China in 2006 and M.S. degree from University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, USA in 2008, both in Electrical Engineering.

The fundamental principle behind such models and much of game theory has been the reliance on Expected Utility Theory (EUT). Motivated by the increasing amount of end-user control afforded in programmable radio devices, we envision a scenario where end-user actions essentially \"interfere\" with the underlying engineered system design. As an exemplary scenario, we consider in this paper wireless random access where players follow the precepts of Prospect Theory (PT), a theory developed by Kahneman and Tversky to explain real-life decision making that often deviates from the behavior expected under EUT. Specifically, we consider a game where selfish players adjust their transmission probabilities over a random access channel under throughput rewards, delay penalties and energy costs. By analyzing the Nash Equilibrium achieved, we prove under mild conditions that deviations from EUT results in degradation of system throughput while increasing delay and energy consumption. Finally, we consider a data pricing model and study the impact of end-user decision-making (i.e., players service choices) at the NE on wireless network performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06747282.pdf","startPage":"1888","endPage":"1907","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.021214.130472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.021214.130472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"When Users Interfere with Protocols: Prospect Theory in Wireless Networks using Random Access and Data Pricing as an Example","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Pricing","Wireless networks","Decision making","Delays","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","game theory","pricing","probability","protocols","radio access networks","telecommunication network management","utility theory","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocol","game theoretic model","radio resource management algorithm","engineered system design","cellular network","ad hoc network","wireless sensor network","expected utility theory","EUT","end-user control","programmable radio device","wireless random access channel network","prospect theory","PT","decision making","transmission probability","Nash equilibrium","energy consumption","data pricing model","NE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Prospect theory","game theory","data pricing","wireless networks","random access"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"When Users Interfere with Protocols: Prospect Theory in Wireless Networks using Random Access and Data Pricing as an Example","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6747282/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252145","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"When Users Interfere with Protocols: Prospect Theory in Wireless Networks using Random Access and Data Pricing as an Example","sourcePdf":"1888-tw1404-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098316S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6747282","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6747283,"authors":[{"name":"Chin Keong Ho","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6747283/6747283-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chin Keong Ho received the B.

The complementary network is either a small-cell network that shares the same resources as the cellular network, or a WiFi network that uses orthogonal resources. For a given demand served in a cellular network, the load, or the level of resource usage, of each cell depends in a non-linear manner on the load of other cells due to the mutual coupling of interference seen by one another. With load coupling, we optimize the demand to be served in the cellular or the complementary networks, so as to maximize a utility function. We consider three representative utility functions that balance, to varying degrees, the revenue from serving the users vs the user fairness. We establish conditions for which the optimization problem has a feasible solution and is convex, and hence tractable to numerical computations. Finally, we propose a strategy with theoretical justification to constrain the load to some maximum value, as required for practical implementation. Numerical studies are conducted for both under-loaded and over-loaded networks.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.021214.130809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06747283.pdf","startPage":"1921","endPage":"1931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.021214.130809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Offloading in Load Coupled Networks: A Utility Maximization Framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747283/","displayDocTitle":"Data Offloading in Load Coupled Networks: A Utility Maximization Framework","volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252142","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6747283/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Offloading in Load Coupled Networks: A Utility Maximization Framework","sourcePdf":"1921-tw1404-ho.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084149S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6747283","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6747284,"authors":[{"name":"Ebrahim Bedeer","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University, NL, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6747284/6747284-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ebrahim Bedeer received the B.Sc.

For such a scenario, we solve the problem of jointly maximizing the CR system throughput and minimizing its transmit power, subject to constraints on both SU and PUs. The optimization problem imposes predefined interference thresholds for the PUs, guarantees the SU quality of service in terms of a maximum bit-error-rate (BER), and satisfies a transmit power budget and a maximum number of allocated bits per subcarrier. Unlike most of the work in the literature that considers perfect SU spectrum sensing capabilities, the problem formulation takes into account errors due to imperfect sensing of the PUs bands. Closed-form expressions are obtained for the optimal bit and power allocations per SU subcarrier. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate the superiority of the MOOP approach when compared to single optimization approaches presented in the literature, without additional complexity. Furthermore, results show that the interference thresholds at the PUs receivers can be severely exceeded due to the perfect spectrum sensing assumption or due to partial channel information on links between the SU and the PUs receivers. Additionally, the results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm approaches that of an exhaustive search for the discrete optimal allocations with a significantly reduced computational effort.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747284/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252157","htmlLink":"/document/6747284/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Multiobjective Optimization Approach for Optimal Link Adaptation of OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems with Imperfect Spectrum Sensing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiobjective Optimization Approach for Optimal Link Adaptation of OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems with Imperfect Spectrum Sensing","sourcePdf":"2339-tw1404-bedeer.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090454S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6747284","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6747285,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The second one is estimating the system gain and phase imbalance values before and after calibrating the system to determine the quality of the manufacturing and calibrating processes (testing). State-of-the-art techniques for both objectives should involve three main aspects to be optimized: computational complexity, reliability and performance. In addition, a framework to use a single technique for both calibration and testing has not been proposed yet. This paper presents a low-complexity and statistically-efficient WLS parameters estimation technique based on the auto-correlation property of Golay complementary sequences (GCS). The proposed technique allows for disregarding the power amplifier (PA) nonlinearities affecting the model, making it reliable. In addition, a framework to extract the phase and gain imbalances in the I/Q branches from the WLS estimations is presented. The low complexity operations of the proposed estimator allow for a cheap hardware implementation. The performance of this technique is illustrated under extreme test cases.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.022014.130414","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06747285.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.022014.130414","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"1854","endPage":"1861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Frequency-Selective I/Q Imbalance Analysis Technique","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Frequency-Selective I/Q Imbalance Analysis Technique","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747285/","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6747285/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252155","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Frequency-Selective I/Q Imbalance Analysis Technique","sourcePdf":"1854-tw1404-avila.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074736S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6747285","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6747286,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Heon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6747286/6747286-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Heon Lee received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering and the M.S. degree in biomedical engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a two-stage semi-distributed resource management framework for the D2D communication. At the first stage of the framework, the base station (BS) allocates resource blocks (RBs) to BS-to-user device (B2D) links and D2D links, in a centralized manner. At the second stage, the BS schedules the transmission using the RBs allocated to B2D links, while the primary user device of each D2D link carries out link adaptation on the RBs allocated to the D2D link, in a distributed fashion. The proposed framework has the advantages of both centralized and distributed design approaches, i.e., high network capacity and low control/computational overhead, respectively. We formulate the problems of RB allocation to maximize the radio resources efficiency, taking account of two different policies on the spatial reuse of RBs. To solve these problems, we suggest a greedy algorithm and a column generation-based algorithm. By simulation, it is shown that the proposed scheme achieves the near-optimal performance while reducing the control/computational overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.022014.130480","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06747286.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.022014.130480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","startPage":"1908","endPage":"1920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Stage Semi-Distributed Resource Management for Device-to-Device Communication in Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-Stage Semi-Distributed Resource Management for Device-to-Device Communication in Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747286/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252184","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6747286/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Stage Semi-Distributed Resource Management for Device-to-Device Communication in Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"1908-tw1404-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098567S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6747286","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6747287,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Tat Chee Ave., Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6747287/6747287-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Zheng received the bachelor's degree in software engineering from Sichuan University, Chengdu, China, in 2011.

By exploiting the positivity, quasi-concavity and homogeneity properties in these problems and using the nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory, we propose fixed-point algorithms that converge geometrically fast to the globally optimal solution. Numerical evaluations show that our algorithms are stable (free of parameter configuration) and computationally fast.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.020714.130980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.020714.130980","startPage":"2086","endPage":"2095","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06747287.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Algorithms in Wireless Utility Maximization: Proportional Fairness Decomposition and Nonlinear Perron-Frobenius Theory Framework","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Algorithms in Wireless Utility Maximization: Proportional Fairness Decomposition and Nonlinear Perron-Frobenius Theory Framework","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","volume":"13","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6747287/","accessionNumber":"14252168","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747287/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Algorithms in Wireless Utility Maximization: Proportional Fairness Decomposition and Nonlinear Perron-Frobenius Theory Framework","sourcePdf":"2086-tw1404-zheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093637S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6747287","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6747288,"authors":[{"name":"Woongsup Lee","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Gyeongsang National University, Republic of Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6747288/6747288-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Woongsup Lee [S'07, M'13] received the B.S. degree and Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the KAIST, Daejeon, Republic of Korea, in 2006 and 2012, respectively.

This type of wireless systems can comprise conventional cognitive radio systems by letting the number of licensed bands be zero. Moreover, we have derived the optimal number of unlicensed bands to be used for maximizing the capacity of wireless system by taking into account interference from neighboring wireless systems. Through simulations, we compare the capacity of wireless systems with two channel state acquisition schemes and show the counterbalancing relation between two schemes, which has never been investigated in previous works.

However, the primary users might be reluctant to accept this help, since the secondary users are untrustworthy and may try unauthorized decoding of the primary users' messages. This paper will answer the question: when is this cooperation mutually beneficial for primary and secondary users? Taking an approach of information-theoretic secrecy, such as coding techniques for wiretap channels, the primary users can allow the secondary users to sense and relay the message, while ensuring that the secondary users are ignorant of the primary users' messages. We characterize an achievable secrecy rate of primary users with a rate of the secondary users' communication. From the derived rate pairs, an optimization problem is formulated such that the secondary transmitter distributes its transmit power to maximize its data rate while providing a higher secrecy rate to the primary users. We demonstrate that this cooperation can provide a positive secrecy rate, even when a non-cooperative scheme achieves a zero secrecy rate.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.021214.130089","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06747289.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.021214.130089","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"1790","endPage":"1805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Communications with Untrusted Secondary Nodes in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Secure Communications with Untrusted Secondary Nodes in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747289/","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6747289/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252163","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Communications with Untrusted Secondary Nodes in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"1790-tw1404-jeon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145075S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6747289","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6747290,"authors":[{"name":"Chunxiao Jiang","affiliation":["University of Maryland, College Park"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6747290/6747290-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chunxiao Jiang (S'09-M'13) received his B.S. degree in information engineering from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (Beihang University) in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University (THU), Beijing in 2013, both with the highest honors.

Moreover, they usually need to make their channel access decisions in a sequential manner to avoid collisions. The characteristic of negative network externality and the structure of sequential decision making make the multi-channel sensing and access problem challenging, which has not been well studied by the existing literatures. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a multi-channel sensing and access game, which not only considers the negative network externality in secondary users' decision making, but also takes into account their sequential decision making structure. We solve the multi-channel sensing problem using Bayesian learning method and design a cooperative learning rule for secondary users to accurately estimate the channel state. We study the multi-channel access problem under two scenarios: with and without resource constraint, respectively. For both scenarios, we design recursive best response algorithms for secondary users to find the subgame perfect Nash equilibria. Specifically, we analyze the homogenous case of the scenario without resource constraint and find that the Nash equilibrium profile exhibits a threshold structure. Finally, we conduct simulations to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.022014.131209","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06747290.pdf","startPage":"2176","endPage":"2188","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.022014.131209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Channel Sensing and Access Game: Bayesian Social Learning with Negative Network Externality","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Channel Sensing and Access Game: Bayesian Social Learning with Negative Network Externality","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6747290/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252178","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747290/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Channel Sensing and Access Game: Bayesian Social Learning with Negative Network Externality","sourcePdf":"2176-tw1404-jiang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068685S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6747290","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6747291,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi M.

It is assumed that only the channel covariance matrices of the relay's receive and transmit channels are available to the relay and that the antennas of the relay are correlated. It is shown that the optimal transmission from the relay should be conducted in the direction of the eigenvectors of the channel covariance matrix. Moreover, necessary and sufficient conditions are derived under which the relay transmission achieves capacity by transmitting from the strongest eigenvector only; this method is called Largest Eigenmode Relaying (LER). The exact result contains an expectation operation that needs to be solved numerically; to reduce the computational complexity, novel methods are proposed that lead to closed-form solutions. A lower bound for the optimal region of LER is derived. Moreover, the effect of the number of source antennas on the optimality of LER is investigated asymptotically. The simulation results show very little difference between the regions in which LER is optimal when the source is equipped with a finite or an infinite number of antennas.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.020714.131047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06747291.pdf","endPage":"2123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Precoding in the Relay and the Optimality of Largest Eigenmode Relaying with Statistical Channel State Information","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.020714.131047","startPage":"2113","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Precoding in the Relay and the Optimality of Largest Eigenmode Relaying with Statistical Channel State Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747291/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252166","publicationDate":"April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6747291/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Precoding in the Relay and the Optimality of Largest Eigenmode Relaying with Statistical Channel State Information","sourcePdf":"2113-tw1404-mehdi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148954S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6747291","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6747294,"authors":[{"name":"Seonwook Kim","affiliation":["Department of ECE and INMC, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6747294/6747294-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seonwook Kim received the B.S. and the Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2007 and 2014, respectively, from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem related to minimization of energy-per-bit which takes a form of nonlinear fractional programming. Then we derive a parametric optimization problem out of that fractional programming and solve the original problem by using a double-loop iteration method. In each iteration, we derive the optimal resource allocation policy by applying Lagrangian duality and an efficient dual update method. In addition, we present suboptimal resource allocation algorithms using the properties of the optimal resource allocation policy. Numerical results reveal that the optimal allocation algorithm improves energy efficiency significantly over the existing resource allocation algorithms designed for homogeneous networks and its performance is superior to suboptimal algorithms in reducing energy consumption as well as in enhancing network energy efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06747294.pdf","startPage":"1862","endPage":"1873","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.022114.130443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.022114.130443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Per-Bit Minimized Radio Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Programming","Wireless LAN","Optimization","Power demand","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","mathematical programming","nonlinear programming","radio networks","resource allocation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-per-bit minimized radio resource allocation","heterogeneous networks","multihoming capability","wireless interfaces","optimization problem","nonlinear fractional programming","parametric optimization problem","double loop iteration method","optimal resource allocation","Lagrangian duality","dual update method","suboptimal resource allocation algorithms","optimal allocation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy-per-bit","fractional programming","heterogeneous network","Lagrangian dual","multi-homing","orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)","radio resource allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747294/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Per-Bit Minimized Radio Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Networks","volume":"13","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6747294/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252146","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Per-Bit Minimized Radio Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"1862-tw1404-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073852S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6747294","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6747295,"authors":[{"name":"Toufiqul Islam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6803026/6747295/6747295-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Toufiqul Islam (S'10) received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.

We propose a mapping based symbol level network coding (SLNC) scheme for a cooperative diversity system comprising multiple sources, multiple relays, and one common destination. A simple cooperative maximum-ratio combining scheme is used at the destination and is shown to successfully exploit both the full spatial and the full frequency diversity offered by the channel for arbitrary numbers of sources, arbitrary numbers of relays, and arbitrary linear modulation schemes. To gain analytical insight for system design, we derive a closed-form upper bound for the asymptotic worst-case pairwise error probability (PEP) and obtain the diversity gain of the considered SLNC scheme for BICM-OFDM systems. These analytical results reveal the influence of the various system parameters, such as the number of sources, the free distance of the code, and the frequency diversity of the involved links, on performance. Furthermore, we propose two different relay selection schemes for the considered system: a) bulk selection, i.e., a single best relay is selected to transmit on all sub-carriers, and b) per-subcarrier selection, where a best relay is selected on each sub-carrier. Last but not least, we exploit the derived PEP expression for selecting a subset of sources from the set of active sources when the number of active sources is larger than the number of available orthogonal relay channels. We study the achievable diversity gain for the proposed relay and source subset selection schemes. Numerical results corroborate the derived diversity gain expressions and confirm the performance gains.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.022114.131050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6803026/06747295.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.022114.131050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803026","startPage":"2096","endPage":"2112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SLNC for Multi-Source Multi-Relay BICM-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SLNC for Multi-Source Multi-Relay BICM-OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747295/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14252165","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6747295/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SLNC for Multi-Source Multi-Relay BICM-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"2096-tw1404-toufiq.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.206609S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6803026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6803026","articleId":"6747295","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6747302,"authors":[{"name":"Songtao Guo","affiliation":["Southwest University, Chongqing, Sichuan, CN"],"firstName":"Songtao","lastName":"Guo"},{"name":"Cong Wang","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, US"],"firstName":"Cong","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Yang","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, US"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Yang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0660"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9875"}],"articleNumber":"6747302","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":184,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2598},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"42KB","file":"/ielx7/7755/6939756/6747302/graphical_abstract/tmc-gagraphic-2307332.jpg","coverImage":""},"abstract":"The emerging wireless energy transfer technology enables charging sensor batteries in a wireless sensor network (WSN) and maintaining perpetual operation of the network. Recent breakthrough in this area has opened up a new dimension to the design of sensor network protocols. In the meanwhile, mobile data gathering has been considered as an efficient alternative to data relaying in WSNs. However, time variation of recharging rates in wireless rechargeable sensor networks imposes a great challenge in obtaining an optimal data gathering strategy. In this paper, we propose a framework of joint wireless energy replenishment and anchor-point based mobile data gathering (WerMDG) in WSNs by considering various sources of energy consumption and time-varying nature of energy replenishment. To that end, we first determine the anchor point selection strategy and the sequence to visit the anchor points. We then formulate the WerMDG problem into a network utility maximization problem which is constrained by flow, energy balance, link and battery capacity and the bounded sojourn time of the mobile collector. Furthermore, we present a distributed algorithm composed of cross-layer data control, scheduling and routing subalgorithms for each sensor node, and sojourn time allocation subalgorithm for the mobile collector at different anchor points. We also provide the convergence analysis of these subalgorithms. Finally, we implement the WerMDG algorithm in a distributed manner in the NS-2 simulator and give extensive numerical results to verify the convergence of the proposed algorithm and the impact of utility weight, link capacity and recharging rate on network performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/6939756/06747302.pdf","startPage":"2836","endPage":"2852","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2014.2307332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2014.2307332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6939756","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Mobile Data Gathering and Energy Provisioning in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Batteries","Mobile communication","Wireless communication","Energy transfer","Energy consumption","Data collection","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","optimisation","scheduling","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint mobile data gathering","wireless rechargeable sensor networks","energy provisioning","wireless energy transfer technology","sensor batteries","WSN","sensor network protocols","mobile data gathering","optimal data gathering strategy","energy replenishment","anchor point selection strategy","utility maximization problem","distributed algorithm","cross-layer data control","routing subalgorithms","scheduling","sojourn time allocation subalgorithm","mobile collector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mobile data gathering","energy replenishment","distributed algorithms","rechargeable sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747302/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Joint Mobile Data Gathering and Energy Provisioning in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks","volume":"13","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14703545","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Mobile Data Gathering and Energy Provisioning in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-yang-2307332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057152S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","isNumber":"6939756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"184","articleId":"6747302","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6747305,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Lin","affiliation":["Center for Microwave and RF Technologies, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6913024/6747305/6747305-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Lin received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering in 2007 from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","He is currently with NXP as a Chief RF Engineer.

Therefore, we approach the design of a CACC system from a Networked Control System (NCS) perspective and present an NCS modeling framework that incorporates the effect of sampling, hold, and network delays that occur due to wireless communication and sampled-data implementation of the CACC controller over this wireless link. Based on this network-aware modeling approach, we develop a technique to study the so-called string stability property of the string, in which vehicles are interconnected by a vehicle following control law and a constant time headway spacing policy. This analysis technique can be used to investigate tradeoffs between CACC performance (string stability) and network specifications (such as delays), which are essential in the multidisciplinary design of CACC controllers. Finally, we demonstrate the validity of the presented framework in practice by experiments performed with CACC-equipped prototype vehicles.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control: Network-Aware Analysis of String Stability","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2014.2302816","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/6869083/06747309.pdf","startPage":"1527","endPage":"1537","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2014.2302816","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6869083","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747309","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747309/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control: Network-Aware Analysis of String Stability","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6747309/","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14501124","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"High Tech Automotive Systems Program"},{"fundingName":"European 7th Framework Network of Excellence: Highly complex and networked control systems (HYCON2)","grantNumber":"257462"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control: Network-Aware Analysis of String Stability","sourcePdf":"tits-oncu-2302816-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08013S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6869083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"203","xplore-issue":"6869083","articleId":"6747309","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6747312,"authors":[{"name":"Kumar H.

The framework does two essential tasks: 1) routing power from surplus locations to deficit locations by effectively coordinating with distributed energy resources (DERs); and 2) enabling customers' participation in electricity enterprise through demand response (DR). The low preference loads of the end-users are grouped into two categories, viz. shiftable and curtailable loads, according to the level of flexibility involved in their operation. Also, three smart DR options are identified to allow the customers to choose as per their requirement. The customer's participation is encouraged through a priority-based incentive mechanism. The proposed incentive mechanism uses frequency of participation of customers in DR and their contribution to benefit gained by the overall system to cater the incentives. The feasibility of the framework is demonstrated by applying on a case study network with two grid-tied microgrids simulated using Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE). The extensive simulation studies on the test network have proved the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed agent-based framework in mitigating the supply-demand gap in multimicrogrid environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Responsive End-User-Based Demand Side Management in Multimicrogrid Environment","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2014.2307761","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/6809862/06747312.pdf","startPage":"1262","endPage":"1272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2014.2307761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809862","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747312/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Responsive End-User-Based Demand Side Management in Multimicrogrid Environment","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6747312/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267591","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Responsive End-User-Based Demand Side Management in Multimicrogrid Environment","sourcePdf":"tii-doolla-2307761-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069314S","chronDate":"May  2014","isNumber":"6809862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"79","articleId":"6747312","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6747320,"authors":[{"name":"Adi Xhakoni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, ESAT-MICAS, Katholieke Universitet Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6787022/6747320/xhako-2307792-small.gif","p":["Adi Xhakoni was born in Durres, Albania, in 1983.

The proposed middleware, operating on a mobile user's hand-held device and collecting the user's contexts through machine-to-machine connectivity, has three major contributions as compared to the current literature. The middleware, based on the collected contexts, firstly classifies a service request, e.g., safety-related or comfort service. Then, it initiates the required network connectivity for service discovery, i.e., the ad-hoc connectivity when an infrastructure-based network is inaccessible. Finally, the middleware selects the service based on a method specifically proposed for that service category, including pre-defined realistic user contexts, to access it. The simulation results show that the middleware achieves up to 12 percent higher success rate compared to the minimum hop count service selection method. Compared with the same method, it has a response time up to 50 percent lower for the safety-related but 80 percent higher for the comfort services. Yet, the middleware attains up to 96 percent user satisfaction rate for both service classes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6951447/06747333.pdf","startPage":"3056","endPage":"3065","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2307875","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2307875","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6951447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Context-Aware M2M-Based Middleware for Service Selection in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Middleware","Ad hoc networks","Mobile computing","Context","Servers","Mobile communication","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["middleware","mobile ad hoc networks","service-oriented architecture","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context-aware M2M-based middleware","service selection","mobile ad-hoc networks","mobile user handheld device","machine-to-machine connectivity","service request","safety-related service","comfort service","network connectivity","service discovery","ad-hoc connectivity","infrastructure-based network","predefined realistic user contexts"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless communication","mobile environments","service-oriented architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747333/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Context-Aware M2M-Based Middleware for Service Selection in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks","volume":"25","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6747333/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14759457","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Context-Aware M2M-Based Middleware for Service Selection in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tpds-ahmedsurobhi-2307875-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079166S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6951447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6951447","articleId":"6747333","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6747344,"authors":[{"name":"Geng Yang","affiliation":["Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan, Stockholm, SE"],"firstName":"Geng","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Li Xie","affiliation":["Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan, Stockholm, SE"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Xie"},{"name":"Matti M\u00e4ntysalo","affiliation":["Tampereen yliopisto -

It has attracted a lot of interests given the abundance of unlabeled data and the high cost of labeling. Most active learning approaches select either informative or representative unlabeled instances to query their labels, which could significantly limit their performance. Although several active learning algorithms were proposed to combine the two query selection criteria, they are usually ad hoc in finding unlabeled instances that are both informative and representative. We address this limitation by developing a principled approach, termed QUIRE, based on the min-max view of active learning. The proposed approach provides a systematic way for measuring and combining the informativeness and representativeness of an unlabeled instance. Further, by incorporating the correlation among labels, we extend the QUIRE approach to multi-label learning by actively querying instance-label pairs. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed QUIRE approach outperforms several state-of-the-art active learning approaches in both single-label and multi-label learning.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6889065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2307881","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/6889065/06747346.pdf","startPage":"1936","endPage":"1949","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2307881","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active Learning by Querying Informative and Representative Examples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Active Learning by Querying Informative and Representative Examples","volume":"36","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6747346/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14564275","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2014","pubMedId":"26352626","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747346/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active Learning by Querying Informative and Representative Examples","sourcePdf":"tpami-huang-2307881-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115381S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6889065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"154","xplore-issue":"6889065","articleId":"6747346","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":6747349,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Zhao","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, US"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Zhao"},{"name":"Ji Li","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, US"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Yang","affiliation":["Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, US"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Yang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1233"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0660"},{"format":"CD","value":"2161-9875"}],"articleNumber":"6747349","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":164,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2939},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"","type":"graphic","fileSize":"52KB","file":"/ielx7/7755/6939756/6747349/graphical_abstract/tmc-gagraphic-2307335.jpg","coverImage":""},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Mobile communication","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Routing protocols","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","optimisation","secondary cells","telecommunication network routing","telecommunication network topology","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint mobile energy replenishment framework","wireless rechargeable sensor networks","wireless sensor networks","energy constraint","sensor batteries","external environments","environmental factors","geographical factors","mobile data collector","short range communication","energy transporter","wireless energy transmissions","joint optimization","random topologies","data gathering latency","network utility maximization problem","distributed algorithm","flow routing","network utility"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless rechargeable sensor networks","mobile energy replenishment","wireless energy transmission","mobile data gathering","network utility"]}],"abstract":"Recent years have witnessed the rapid development and proliferation of techniques on improving energy efficiency for wireless sensor networks. Although these techniques can relieve the energy constraint on wireless sensors to some extent, the lifetime of wireless sensor networks is still limited by sensor batteries. Recent studies have shown that energy rechargeable sensors have the potential to provide perpetual network operations by capturing renewable energy from external environments. However, the low output of energy capturing devices can only provide intermittent recharging opportunities to support low-rate data services due to spatial-temporal, geographical or environmental factors. To provide steady and high recharging rates and achieve energy efficient data gathering from sensors, in this paper, we propose to utilize mobility for joint energy replenishment and data gathering. In particular, a multi-functional mobile entity, called SenCarin this paper, is employed, which serves not only as a mobile data collector that roams over the field to gather data via short-range communication but also as an energy transporter that charges static sensors on its migration tour via wireless energy transmissions. Taking advantages of SenCar's controlled mobility, we focus on the joint optimization of effective energy charging and high-performance data collections. We first study this problem in general networks with random topologies. We give a two-step approach for the joint design. In the first step, the locations of a subset of sensors are periodically selected as anchor points, where the SenCar will sequentially visit to charge the sensors at these locations and gather data from nearby sensors in a multi-hop fashion. To achieve a desirable balance between energy replenishment amount and data gathering latency, we provide a selection algorithm to search for a maximum number of anchor points where sensors hold the least battery energy, and meanwhile by visiting them, the tour length of the SenCar is no more than a threshold. In the second step, we consider data gathering performance when the SenCar migrates among these anchor points. We formulate the problem into a network utility maximization problem and propose a distributed algorithm to adjust data rates at which sensors send buffered data to the SenCar, link scheduling and flow routing so as to adapt to the up-to-date energy replenishing status of sensors. Besides general networks, we also study a special scenario where sensors are regularly deployed. For this case we can provide a simplified solution of lower complexity by exploiting the symmetry of the topology. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approaches by extensive numerical results, which show that our solutions can achieve perpetual network operations and provide high network utility.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2014.2307335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/6939756/06747349.pdf","startPage":"2689","endPage":"2705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2014.2307335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6939756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework of Joint Mobile Energy Replenishment and Data Gathering in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747349","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747349/","displayDocTitle":"A Framework of Joint Mobile Energy Replenishment and Data Gathering in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks","volume":"13","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14703546","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework of Joint Mobile Energy Replenishment and Data Gathering in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-yang-2307335-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049249S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","isNumber":"6939756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"164","articleId":"6747349","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6747351,"authors":[{"name":"Jiming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6980150/6747351/6747351-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiming Chen (M'08-SM'11) received the BSc and the PhD degrees both in control science and engineering from Zhejiang University in 2000 and 2005, respectively.

However, the extra overhead posed by the multi-channel usage coordination dramatically challenges the energy-constrained WSNs. In this paper, we propose a Regret Matching based Channel Assignment algorithm (RMCA) to address this challenge, in which each sensor node updates its choice of channels according to the historical record of these channels' performance to reduce interference. The advantage of RMCA is that it is highly distributed and requires very limited information exchange among sensor nodes. It is proved that RMCA converges almost surely to the set of correlated equilibrium. Moreover, RMCA can adapt the channel assignment among sensor nodes to the time-variant flows and network topology. Simulations show that RMCA achieves better network performance in terms of both delivery ratio and packet latency than CONTROL [1], MMSN [2] and randomized CSMA. In addition, real hardware experiments are conducted to demonstrate that RMCA is easy to be implemented and performs better.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","volume":"26","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"14840522","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6747351/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic channel assignment for wireless sensor networks: A regret matching based approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic channel assignment for wireless sensor networks: A regret matching based approach","sourcePdf":"tpds-chen-2307868-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085125S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6980150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6980150","articleId":"6747351","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6747360,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijian Zhou","affiliation":["University of Grenoble, Grenoble, France","Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/6913031/6747360/zhou-2304730-small.gif","p":["Zhijian Zhou was born in Nanjing, China.

In many scenarios the unknown vector is sparse, i.e., a large fraction of its entries are zero. Examples include applications in wireless communications, digital fingerprinting, and array-comparative genomic hybridization systems. Sphere decoding, commonly used for solving integer least-squares problems, can utilize the knowledge about sparsity of the unknown vector to perform computationally efficient search for the solution. In this paper, we formulate and analyze the sparsity-aware sphere decoding algorithm that imposes l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n-norm constraint on the admissible solution. Analytical expressions for the expected complexity of the algorithm for alphabets typical of sparse channel estimation and source allocation applications are derived and validated through extensive simulations. The results demonstrate superior performance and speed of sparsity-aware sphere decoder compared to the conventional sparsity-unaware sphere decoding algorithm. Moreover, variance of the complexity of the sparsity-aware sphere decoding algorithm for binary alphabets is derived. The search space of the proposed algorithm can be further reduced by imposing lower bounds on the value of the objective function. The algorithm is modified to allow for such a lower bounding technique and simulations illustrating efficacy of the method are presented. Performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in an application to sparse channel estimation, where it is shown that sparsity-aware sphere decoder performs close to theoretical lower limits.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2307836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6782402/06747382.pdf","startPage":"2212","endPage":"2225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2307836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparsity-Aware Sphere Decoding: Algorithms and Complexity Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747382","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747382/","displayDocTitle":"Sparsity-Aware Sphere Decoding: Algorithms and Complexity Analysis","volume":"62","issue":"9","publicationDate":"May1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14210076","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6747382/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparsity-Aware Sphere Decoding: Algorithms and Complexity Analysis","sourcePdf":"tsp-vikalo-2307836-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134181S","chronDate":"May1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6782402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6782402","articleId":"6747382","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6747383,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Rashid","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Umm Al-Qura University, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"p":["Muhammad Rashid received the Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar, Pakistan, in 2000, the Master's degree in embedded systems design from the University of Nice, Sophia-Antipolis, France, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in embedded systems design from the University of Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France, in 2009.","He is an Assistant Professor with the Computer Engineering Department, Umm Al-Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia.

The result has been highly fragmented curricula consisting of various disconnected theory courses and laboratory practicals. A holistic approach to curricula development that focuses on integrated fundamental knowledge is required to remedy this. This paper proposes a holistic approach to developing a CpE curriculum and to maintaining continuous, coherent development of that curriculum. The elements of the proposed approach are the following: formulation of objectives, identification of major curriculum areas, construction of a system model for CpE core courses by using the Y-chart methodology, description of electives, integration of laboratory practices, and assessment of the curriculum. An assessment of the curriculum is presented based on survey data and accreditation outcomes.

However, charging sensor nodes one at a time poses a serious scalability problem. Recent advances in magnetic resonant coupling show that multiple nodes can be charged at the same time. In this paper, we exploit this multi-node wireless energy transfer technology and investigate whether it is a scalable technology to address energy issues in a WSN. We consider a wireless charging vehicle (WCV) periodically traveling inside a WSN and charging sensor nodes wirelessly. Based on charging range of the WCV, we propose a cellular structure that partitions the two-dimensional plane into adjacent hexagonal cells. We pursue a formal optimization framework by jointly optimizing traveling path, flow routing, and charging time. By employing discretization and a novel Reformulation-Linearization Technique (RLT), we develop a provably near-optimal solution for any desired level of accuracy. Through numerical results, we demonstrate that our solution can indeed address the charging scalability problem in a WSN.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Node Wireless Energy Charging in Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2014.2303979","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7086110/06747384.pdf","startPage":"437","endPage":"450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2014.2303979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7086110","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747384","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747384/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Node Wireless Energy Charging in Sensor Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6747384/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15057718","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Node Wireless Energy Charging in Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-hou-2303979-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134679S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7086110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"7086110","articleId":"6747384","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6747391,"authors":[{"name":"John Lipor","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, KAUST, Thuwal, Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6782402/6747391/6747391-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["John Lipor is a Ph.D. student at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and an awardee of the 2013 NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program.

Transmit waveform design is a topic that has received much attention recently, involving synthesis of both the signal covariance matrix, R, as well as the actual waveforms. Current methods involve a two-step process of designing R via iterative solutions and then using R to generate waveforms that fulfill practical constraints such as having a constant-envelope or drawing from a finite alphabet. In this paper, a closed-form method to design R for a uniform linear array is proposed that utilizes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficients and Toeplitz matrices. The resulting covariance matrix fulfills the practical constraints such as positive semidefiniteness and the uniform elemental power constraint and provides performance similar to that of iterative methods, which require a much greater computation time. Next, a transmit architecture is presented that exploits the orthogonality of frequencies at discrete DFT values to transmit a sum of orthogonal signals from each antenna. The resulting waveforms provide a lower mean-square error than current methods at a much lower computational cost, and a simulated detection scenario demonstrates the performance advantages achieved.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6782402/06747391.pdf","startPage":"2226","endPage":"2235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2307838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2307838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782402","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fourier-Based Transmit Beampattern Design Using MIMO Radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrices","MIMO","Iterative methods","Transmitting antennas","Discrete Fourier transforms","Cost function","MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","covariance matrices","discrete Fourier transforms","iterative methods","MIMO radar","radar antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier based transmit beampattern design","MIMO radar","transmit waveform design","signal covariance matrix","iterative solutions","closed form method","uniform linear array","discrete Fourier transform coefficients","Toeplitz matrices","uniform elemental power constraint","transmit architecture","mean square error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beampattern","discrete Fourier transform (DFT)","multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar","waveform design"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Fourier-Based Transmit Beampattern Design Using MIMO Radar","volume":"62","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6747391/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14210075","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fourier-Based Transmit Beampattern Design Using MIMO Radar","sourcePdf":"tsp-lipor-2307838-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069734S","chronDate":"May1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6782402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6782402","articleId":"6747391","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6747397,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Guan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety and the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6923505/6747397/guan-2307917-small.gif","p":["\nKe Guan (S'10\u2013M'13) received the B.E. degree from Beijing Jiaotong\nUniversity, Beijing, China, in 2006.

They can block the line of sight (LOS), generate multiple reflected and scattered waves, and aggravate the fading behavior; however, these effects have been rarely investigated. This paper presents a group of 930-MHz measurements conducted on train stations of high-speed railways in China. The whole process of a train passing stations has been measured with two typical types of stations. The results indicate that, when the station is far from the transmitter (Tx), the semi-closed station (in which the awnings cover both the platforms and the rails) influences the propagation much more seriously than the open station (in which the awnings only cover the platforms supporting a clear free space over the tracks). When the station is near the Tx, the fact of whether the train keeps the LOS and stays inside the station determines the propagation for both types of stations. All the propagation characteristics, including extra propagation loss, shadow fading, small-scale fading, level crossing rate (LCR), average fade duration (AFD), and fading depth (FD), have been measured and computed for the first time. Specific findings of propagation characteristics in the train station scenario are provided. Afterward, by filling the gap of the train station scenario, a table is made to establish the comprehensive understanding of main scenarios in the high-speed railway. Furthermore, comparisons of the propagation characteristics between the train station scenario and ten standard scenarios are made to emphasize the significance of the modeling exclusively for the train station scenario. Finally, rules of the influence of four conditions are quantitatively revealed. The measured results and quantitative analysis are significant for leading the simulation and design of signaling and train control communications systems toward the reality.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation Measurements and Analysis for Train Stations of High-Speed Railway at 930 MHz","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2307917","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6923505/06747397.pdf","startPage":"3499","endPage":"3516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2307917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747397/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Propagation Measurements and Analysis for Train Stations of High-Speed Railway at 930 MHz","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6747397/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665029","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1334202 and 61222105"},{"fundingName":"Research Team in University","grantNumber":"IRT0949"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Municipal National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4112048"},{"fundingName":"Key Grant Project of the Chinese Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"313006"},{"fundingName":"Project of State Key Laboratories","grantNumber":"RCS2012ZT013, RCS2011K008, RCS2011ZZ008 and RCS2014ZT11"},{"fundingName":"Key Project for Railway Ministry of China","grantNumber":"2012X008-A"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation Measurements and Analysis for Train Stations of High-Speed Railway at 930 MHz","sourcePdf":"tvt-guan-2307917-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151417S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6923505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6923505","articleId":"6747397","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6747402,"authors":[{"name":"Wenlin Zhang","affiliation":["Western Digital Corporation, Irvine, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6980150/6747402/zhang-small.gif","p":["Wenlin Zhang","received the BEng degree in automation from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China,\n and the PhD degree from the Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ.

Existing distributed consensus-based fusion algorithms only ensure equal gain combining of local measurements, whose performance may be incomparable to various centralized soft combining schemes. Motivated by this fact, we consider practical channel conditions and link failures, and develop new weighted soft measurement combining without a centralized fusion center. Following the measurement by its energy detector, each secondary user exchanges its own measurement statistics with its local one-hop neighbors, and chooses the information exchanging rate according to the measurement channel condition, e.g., the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We rigorously prove the convergence of the new consensus algorithm, and show all secondary users hold the same global decision statistics from the weighted soft measurement combining throughout the network. We also provide distributed optimal weight design under uncorrelated measurement channels. The convergence rate of the consensus iteration is given under the assumption that each communication link has an independent probability to fail, and the upper bound of the iteration number of the \u03b5-convergence is explicitly given as a function of system parameters. Simulation results show significant improvement of the sensing performance compared to existing consensus-based approaches, and the performance of the distributed weighted design is comparable to the centralized weighted combining scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2307951","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6980150/06747402.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2307951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"54","endPage":"64","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Consensus-Based Weight Design for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Consensus-Based Weight Design for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747402/","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6747402/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14840525","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008982","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1318748, IIS-1218155 and CNS-0954020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Consensus-Based Weight Design for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","sourcePdf":"tpds-zhang-2307951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077462S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6980150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6980150","articleId":"6747402","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6747404,"authors":[{"name":"Yeomyung Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6863726/6747404/6747404-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yeomyung Kim (S'10) was born in Daegu, Korea, in 1985.

In addition to delay constraints, such applications also have various traffic patterns and require guarantees on throughputs of packets that are delivered within their delay constraints. Furthermore, a mechanism for serving delay-constrained traffic needs to specifically consider the unreliable nature of wireless links, which may differ from link to link. Also, as it is usually infeasible to gather feedback information from all clients after each transmission, broadcasting delay-constrained traffic requires addressing the challenge of the lack of feedback information. We study a model that jointly considers the application requirements on traffic patterns, delay constraints, and throughput requirements, as well as wireless limitations, including the unreliable wireless links and the lack of feedback information. Based on this model, we develop a general framework for designing feasibility-optimal broadcasting policies that applies to systems with various network coding mechanisms. We demonstrate the usage of this framework by designing policies for three different kinds of systems: one that does not use network coding, one that employs XOR coding, and the last that allows the usage of linear coding.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2014.2304880","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7122959/06747408.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2014.2304880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7122959","startPage":"728","endPage":"740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadcasting Delay-Constrained Traffic Over Unreliable Wireless Links With Network Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Broadcasting Delay-Constrained Traffic Over Unreliable Wireless Links With Network Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747408/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"24 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15201220","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6747408/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadcasting Delay-Constrained Traffic Over Unreliable Wireless Links With Network Coding","sourcePdf":"tnet-hou-2304880-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090756S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7122959","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7122959","articleId":"6747408","onlineDate":"24 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6747448,"authors":[{"name":"Shiling Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Lab. of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, P.R.

The electrical properties of insulating material are both function of electric stress and temperature, thus, changes of electrical parameters due to temperature gradient will affect the DC steady E-field distribution of composite insulation structure. Based on this, to accurately simulate DC steady E-field of composite insulation structure with temperature gradient, this paper applied nonlinear finite element method to the coupling analysis of these two affecting factors. Firstly, relationship between electrical parameters of insulation materials and temperature, electrical stress was investigated. Then, the DC steady E-field calculation method with nonlinear finite element was proposed and verified by the simple coaxial insulation structure model. Finally, 2D simulation model of barrier system was established to simulate and analyze the DC steady E-field considering nonlinear characteristics of materials. The results show that the results of traditional simulation are quite different from those when considering material nonlinearity.

First, the error of training drops slowly. Second, the adjustment time is too long because of too many iteration steps.

Therefore, a new BP network method optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) and Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm is proposed. In this method, the BP network's structure is optimized by GA. Then LM algorithm is used to train the BP network. The training result could diagnose the faults of analog circuits, which is able to overcome the inherent disadvantages of traditional BP network.

A general method is to reduce the basis first and then perform an exhaustive search within certain region. In this paper, several widely used basis reduction (or decorrelation) algorithms are presented, the Korkine-Zolotareff (KZ) reduction, LLL reduction, integer inverse Cholesky decorrelation (IICD) and integer Gaussian decorrelation (IGD). Their pros and cons are evaluated by the simulation results, which show that none of them can be uniformly superior than the others.

It employs several dynamic reconfigurable multi-operation arithmetic units, aims at high-performance media processing and in industrial control applications.

Simulation numerical results show that the resolution with adaptive genetic algorithm is more robust and reliable than simple genetic algorithm (SGA).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747716/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14130347","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6747716/","publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Single frequency GNSS integer ambiguity resolution with adaptive genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single frequency GNSS integer ambiguity resolution with adaptive genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPT0024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038123S","chronDate":"23-25 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6737458","isNumber":"6747486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6737458","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6747486","articleId":"6747716","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6747718,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Li","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Li","id":"37086674655"},{"name":"Xiaohua Wang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electrical, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086674220"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2764-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5137-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2763-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-4357"}],"articleNumber":"6747718","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Dictionaries","Electronic mail","Sensors","Joints","Xenon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","dictionaries","image reconstruction","image resolution","image sampling","video cameras","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video compressive sensing","overcompleted dictionary","video cameras","spatial resolution reduction","temporal resolution","video acquisition system","imaging efficiency","signal acquisition","video reconstruction","Nyquist sampling rate"]}],"abstract":"Traditional video cameras have problem with preserving patial and temporal resolution synchronously due to hardware factors such as readout and analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion time of sensors. To overcome this problem without more hardware cost, we propose a new video acquisition system which employs compressive sensing theory to improve the imaging efficiency. Compressive Sensing (CS) is an innovative theory which allows us to combine signal acquisition and compression together, thus capturing compressed signal directly. In this paper, we explore the advantage that video volumes could be sparsely represented under over-completed dictionary. With this characteristic, we can reconstruct the original video with far fewer measurements than conventional Nyquist sampling rate. Experimental results validate that we can obtain promising recovery with limited measurement Also, we gain frame rate improvement without spatial resolution reduction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video compressive sensing with over-completed dictionary","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","doi":"10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747718","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6737458/6747486/06747718.pdf","startPage":"1056","endPage":"1060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747718","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747718/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 March 2013","displayDocTitle":"Video compressive sensing with over-completed dictionary","conferenceDate":"23-25 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6747718/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"14130548","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video compressive sensing with over-completed dictionary","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPT0033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094063S","chronDate":"23-25 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6737458","isNumber":"6747486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6737458","xplore-issue":"6747486","articleId":"6747718","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6747727,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammed Kamrul Islam","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Engineering, Beihang University, PR China"],"firstName":"Muhammed Kamrul","lastName":"Islam","id":"37086760669"},{"name":"RongKe Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Engineering, Beihang University, PR China"],"lastName":"RongKe Liu","id":"37289647500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2764-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5137-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2763-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-4357"}],"articleNumber":"6747727","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":506},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747727","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Fading","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio","Approximation methods","AWGN channels","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","AWGN channels","channel capacity","channel coding","fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polar coding","variable channel condition","channel coding scheme","B-DMC channel capacity","wireless fading channel","approximation theory","AWGN channel","quantization","pre-set frozen set"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747727","endPage":"1098","startPage":"1096","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6737458/6747486/06747727.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polar coding for fading channel","abstract":"The wireless applications are increasing day by day with higher rate of transmission. The variable channel conditions make it challenging to serve with the required data rate and acceptable performance. The ideal channel conditions and their respective channel coding schemes are directly not applicable to the wireless channel regime. Polar Coding has recently been invented and proven to be capacity achieving for B-DMC channel. The wireless channel being not `memoryless' and not `ergodic' cannot directly take the capacity achieving benefit of Polar Coding. However, we propose some approximation of the wireless channel so that the Polar Coding can be applied with some moderation for the wireless fading channel. In particular we discuss the slow fading channel and propose some methodical steps to apply the coding scheme. The approximation of fading channel as an AWGN channel for some duration of channel state, quantization of the channel to a finite number of channel states, pre-set frozen sets to be applied for the particular channel state are the key steps of the paper. Although the approximations make the performance suboptimal, we present some initial work in progress research simulation results for the suitability of Polar Coding for fading channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747727/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6747727/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14130350","conferenceDate":"23-25 March 2013","publicationDate":"March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Polar coding for fading channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polar coding for fading channel","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPT0078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054032S","chronDate":"23-25 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6737458","isNumber":"6747486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6737458","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6747486","articleId":"6747727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6747735,"authors":[{"name":"Xurong Pi","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xurong","lastName":"Pi","id":"37995121700"},{"name":"Yueming Cai","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yueming","lastName":"Cai","id":"37290653400"},{"name":"Wendong Yang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wendong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37290576900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2764-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5137-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2763-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-4357"}],"articleNumber":"6747735","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":30},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multirate cooperative MAC protocol employing statistic channel state information","abstract":"A multirate cooperative MAC (MC-MAC) protocol is designed for networks with slowly-changing channels between nodes.

The CS literature has mostly focused on the problems involving 1-D signals and 2-D images. However, for hyperspectral image, compressive acquisition of this signal is complicated for its 3-D structures. In this paper, we consider the correlation of spatial and spectral of hyperspectral image and propose spatial-spectral compressive sensing. The results show that the proposed method leads to an increase in CS reconstruction performance under the same compression ratio and reconstruction algorithm. In particular, our method is more advantageous in realizing airborne or spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensing for its lower memory storage.","doi":"10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747765","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6737458/6747486/06747765.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747486","startPage":"1256","endPage":"1259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial-spectral compressive sensing of hyperspectral image","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spatial-spectral compressive sensing of hyperspectral image","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747765/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 March 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"14130461","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6747765/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial-spectral compressive sensing of hyperspectral image","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPT0197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045129S","chronDate":"23-25 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6737458","isNumber":"6747486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6737458","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6747486","articleId":"6747765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6747766,"authors":[{"name":"Meiyan Ju","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information, Hohai University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PRC"],"firstName":"Meiyan","lastName":"Ju","id":"37682457400"},{"name":"Jia Qian","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information, Hohai University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PRC"],"firstName":"Jia","lastName":"Qian","id":"37086678767"},{"name":"Yueheng Li","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information, Hohai University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PRC"],"firstName":"Yueheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37085869696"},{"name":"Guoping Tan","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information, Hohai University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PRC"],"firstName":"Guoping","lastName":"Tan","id":"37668640700"},{"name":"Xujie Li","affiliation":["College of Computer and Information, Hohai University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PRC"],"firstName":"Xujie","lastName":"Li","id":"37086681115"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2764-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5137-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2763-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-4357"}],"articleNumber":"6747766","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":941},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Receiving antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","Transmitting antennas","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","MIMO systems","multi-access systems","radio receivers","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems","MU-MIMO systems","matched filtering","MF receiver","zero-forcing receivers","ZF receiver","minimum mean square error","MMSE receivers","baseband system model","multiuser interference","MUI","receive antennas"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the three receivers in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems based on the different criteria which are matched filtering (MF), zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE).

Proposed scheme is evaluated using different types of images for different values of the modulation parameter and different underwater channel physical parameters.","doi":"10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747791","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6737458/6747486/06747791.pdf","startPage":"1365","endPage":"1371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SPIHT coded image transmission over underwater acoustic channel with unequal error protection using HQAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747791/","displayDocTitle":"SPIHT coded image transmission over underwater acoustic channel with unequal error protection using HQAM","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"14130521","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6747791/","conferenceDate":"23-25 March 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SPIHT coded image transmission over underwater acoustic channel with unequal error protection using HQAM","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPT0314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098989S","chronDate":"23-25 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6737458","isNumber":"6747486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6737458","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6747486","articleId":"6747791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6747798,"authors":[{"name":"Yaoran Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yaoran","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086761694"},{"name":"Fei Song","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Song","id":"37889622700"},{"name":"Zhang Deng","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Deng","id":"38236347200"},{"name":"Chao Li","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Li","id":"37086764026"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2764-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5137-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2763-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-4357"}],"articleNumber":"6747798","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Measurement","Relays","Ad hoc networks","Cognitive radio","Energy efficiency","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-aware routing","cognitive radio ad hoc networks","CRAHN","mobile devices","relative energy metric","two relay users selection methods","power consumption","proactive route scheme","reactive node selection method"]}],"abstract":"In cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs), because mobile devices are mainly powered by battery, efficient consumption of energy is a key problem to be improved. In this paper we study how to find an energy efficient route for a session in CRAHNs. We propose a relative energy metric for routing in CRAHNs, and develop two relay users selection methods for CRAHNs, one of which is proactive and the other is reactive. The new routing scheme could select proper relay nodes, channels, and transmitter power for a session, aims to supply enough communication rate, to decrease the average total power consumption of each session, and to prolong the life of the total network at the same time. In addition, we compare the performance of a proactive route scheme with that of reactive method. Numerical results show that the effectiveness of our proposed routing scheme is with good generalization ability, and the reactive node selection method may better satisfy CRNs.","doi":"10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747798","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6737458/6747486/06747798.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747798","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","startPage":"1397","endPage":"1401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An energy-aware routing for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 March 2013","displayDocTitle":"An energy-aware routing for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747798/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6747798/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"14130512","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 March 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An energy-aware routing for cognitive radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPT0331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051086S","chronDate":"23-25 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6737458","isNumber":"6747486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6737458","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6747486","articleId":"6747798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-02"},{"_id":6747799,"authors":[{"name":"Huifeng Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PRC"],"firstName":"Huifeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086784896"},{"name":"Zhan Gao","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PRC"],"firstName":"Zhan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37291179100"},{"name":"Qiao Yin","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu, PRC"],"firstName":"Qiao","lastName":"Yin","id":"37086784384"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2764-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5137-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2763-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-4357"}],"articleNumber":"6747799","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Cognitive radio","Interference","Equations","Estimation","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","maximum likelihood estimation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active learning","cognitive radio networks","primary user localization","primary transmitter","primary receiver","PR localization","secondary user","interference signal","maximum likelihood estimation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747799","doi":"10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747799","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","abstract":"Most of existing works on primary user (PU) localization locate primary transmitter (PT) while the purpose of localization is to avoid interfering with primary receiver (PR). Therefore, it is more important to locate PR. In this paper, we propose a PR localization method based on active learning. The secondary user (SU) initiatively sends a probing signal to interfere with the PU, then the PU adapts transmit power and/or rate upon the interference signal and such transmit adaptations are observed by the SU, whereby the SU learns the PU's strategy for transmit adaptations. From the observation, the SU estimates the distance between the PR and the SU. Finally, the location of the PR can be estimated by maximum likelihood estimation without prior information of the PR transmission power.

wireless sensor networks (WSNs) working in the license-free band, suffering from heavy interference as the license-free spectrum becomes increasingly crowded. Designing a WSN based on cognitive radios could be a promising approach in the near future to provide data transmissions with strict QoS requirements. In this paper, the heterogeneous traffic including real-time and best effort traffic is considered in a cluster-based cognitive radio sensor network (CRSN). Using the reservation-based policy, satisfactory to the latency requirements of CBR traffic can be achieved and adequate time can be reserved for serving the BE traffic simultaneously. We analyze the delay performance of the real-time traffic, and verify the analytical results using computer simulations. The results show that satisfactory to the latency requirements of CBR traffic can be achieved and adequate time can be reserved for serving the BE traffic at the same time.

Both the relay and destination are subjected to multiple co-channel interferences (CCIs). An exact closed-form outage probability expression is derived for the Rayleigh fading channels. Then, to render more insights into the combined effects of multiple antennas and CCIs, the asymptotic behavior of the outage probability is also presented and discussed. Based on the asymptotic expressions, we explicitly characterize the system diversity order. The results show that the diversity order is essentially directly proportional to the number of antennas at the relay. Furthermore, employing both exact optimal power allocation (OPA) and asymptotic OPA methods, we determine the optimal power allocation (OPA) such that the outage probability is minimized. We show that OPA offers superior performance over uniform power allocation, and highlight a pivotal design choice for maximizing system performance without investing additional resources.","doi":"10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747814","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6737458/6747486/06747814.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747486","startPage":"1465","endPage":"1470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis and optimization of dual-hop MIMO relay system with MIMO-MRC scheme in the presence of co-channel interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis and optimization of dual-hop MIMO relay system with MIMO-MRC scheme in the presence of co-channel interference","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747814/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 March 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"14130367","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6747814/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis and optimization of dual-hop MIMO relay system with MIMO-MRC scheme in the presence of co-channel interference","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPT0392.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11692S","chronDate":"23-25 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6737458","isNumber":"6747486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6737458","xplore-issue":"6747486","articleId":"6747814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6747816,"authors":[{"name":"Lanxiang Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lanxiang","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086758255"},{"name":"Fei Yang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37405696000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2764-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5137-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2763-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-4357"}],"articleNumber":"6747816","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"abstract":"The RF systems of Digital Broadcast Transmitter generally take two forms, ZIF and DIF structure.

Proposed scheme evaluated using different types of images for different values of the modulation parameter and underwater channel physical parameters.","doi":"10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747842","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Third International Conference on Information Science and Technology (ICIST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6737458/6747486/06747842.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIST.2013.6747842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747486","startPage":"1596","endPage":"1601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image transmission over underwater acoustic environment using OFDM technique with HQAM mapper","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Image transmission over underwater acoustic environment using OFDM technique with HQAM mapper","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 March 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747842/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 March 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","accessionNumber":"14130447","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6747842/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image transmission over underwater acoustic environment using OFDM technique with HQAM mapper","confLoc":"Yangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPT0473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07826S","chronDate":"23-25 March 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6737458","isNumber":"6747486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6737458","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6747486","articleId":"6747842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6747844,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangyang Xu","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering & Technological R&D Center, Zhengzhou, Henan, PRC"],"firstName":"Xiangyang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086747614"},{"name":"Wenyu Luo","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering & Technological R&D Center, Zhengzhou, Henan, PRC"],"firstName":"Wenyu","lastName":"Luo","id":"37710626800"},{"name":"Huawei Song","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering & Technological R&D Center, Zhengzhou, Henan, PRC"],"firstName":"Huawei","lastName":"Song","id":"38667736100"},{"name":"Lizhi Zhang","affiliation":["National Digital Switching System Engineering & Technological R&D Center, Zhengzhou, Henan, PRC"],"firstName":"Lizhi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086746978"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-2764-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5137-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-2763-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-4357"}],"articleNumber":"6747844","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Communication system security","Wireless communication","Vectors","Extraterrestrial measurements","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","jamming","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless security","ill-posed problem","physical-layer encryption mechanism","physical-layer security","channel state information","wireless transmissions","randomized transmission","low-probability-of interception"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies physical-layer security without knowing the eavesdropper's channel state information. The use of ill-posed theory to protect wireless transmissions is proposed.

Secondly, by exploiting the nonunique or instable solutions of an ill-posed problem, two mechanisms are proposed that satisfy the given security requirement while achieving good throughput performance.

The GPGPU design philosophy allocates most of the chip area to processing cores, and thus results in a relatively small cache shared by a large number of cores when compared with conventional multi-core CPUs. Applying a proper thread mapping scheme is crucial for gaining from constructive cache sharing and avoiding resource contention among thousands of threads. However, due to the significant differences on architectures and programming models, the existing thread mapping approaches for multi-core CPUs do not perform as effective on GPGPUs. This paper proposes a formal model to capture both the characteristics of threads as well as the cache sharing behavior of multi-level shared cache. With appropriate proofs, the model forms a solid theoretical foundation beneath the proposed cache hierarchy aware thread mapping methodology for multi-level shared cache GPGPUs. The experiments reveal that the three-staged thread mapping methodology can successfully improve the data reuse on each cache level of GPGPUs and achieve an average of 2.3\u00d7 to 4.3\u00d7 runtime enhancement when compared with existing approaches.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2014.2308179","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7056411/06747979.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2014.2308179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7056411","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"884","endPage":"898","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Cache Hierarchy Aware Thread Mapping Methodology for GPGPUs","volume":"64","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6747979/","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14982407","publicationDate":"April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cache Hierarchy Aware Thread Mapping Methodology for GPGPUs","sourcePdf":"tc-kuo-2308179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151285S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7056411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7056411","articleId":"6747979","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6747982,"authors":[{"name":"Pei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7056411/6747982/6747982-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pei Huang received the BS and MS degrees in electrical engineering from Southwest Jiaotong University, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

However, when an event is detected, a large number of packets may be generated. A MAC protocol designed for this kind of WSNs should be able to swiftly adapt to the two conditions. Most WSN MAC protocols are optimized for light traffic for the energy efficiency consideration. In this paper, we propose a novel receiver-centric MAC protocol called RC-MAC that seamlessly integrates duty cycling and receiver-centric scheduling, providing high throughput without sacrificing the energy efficiency. To handle bursty traffic triggered by an event, RC-MAC takes advantage of the underlying data gathering tree structure of WSNs and the multichannel technique supported by current IEEE 802.15.4 RF transceivers to assist scheduling of medium access. The throughput is improved in two phases with receiver-centric medium access scheduling and distributed channel assignment. First, on a data gathering tree, a receiver is able to coordinate the medium access of multiple senders so as to reduce collisions and achieve high throughput. Second, different receivers coordinate their senders in different channels and the throughput is further improved by allowing parallel data gathering. Observing packet processing time on low cost sensor nodes, we design a scheduling pattern that ensures fairness between source nodes without sacrificing the throughput. We evaluate the performance of our RC-MAC through measurements of an implementation in TinyOS on TelosB motes and extensive ns-2 simulations. Compared with contention-based and scheduling-based MAC protocols, we show that the throughput and the fairness under heavy traffic load are significantly improved by the receiver-centric scheduling. Due to the high throughput, the energy efficiency is also improved.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7056411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2014.2308174","doi":"10.1109/TC.2014.2308174","startPage":"1149","endPage":"1161","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7056411/06747982.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747982/","displayDocTitle":"RC-MAC: A Receiver-Centric MAC Protocol for Event-Driven Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"64","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"14982408","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6747982/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RC-MAC: A Receiver-Centric MAC Protocol for Event-Driven Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tc-xiao-2308174-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070694S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7056411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7056411","articleId":"6747982","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-29"},{"_id":6747983,"authors":[{"name":"Dima Bykhovsky","affiliation":["Electro-optical Engineering Unit, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Dima","lastName":"Bykhovsky","id":"37594033200"},{"name":"Shlomi Arnon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomi","lastName":"Arnon","id":"37271167400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8724"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2213"}],"articleNumber":"6747983","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":108,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1826},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Optical Society of America","url":"http://www.osa.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://taes.msubmit.net/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/im/imnew/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747983","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Optical transmitters","Interference","Optimization","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light interference","optical modulation","optical transmitters","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple access resource allocation","visible light communication system","interference-constrained subcarrier reuse","power redistribution","bit-rate","discrete multitone modulation","single-transmitter technique","multiple transmitter environment","power allocation design","spatial multiple-transmitter diversity","power constraints","multiple access DMT communication","MA-DMT scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-biased optical discrete multi-tone (DCO-DMT)","dc-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM)","discrete multi-tone (DMT)","free-space optical (FSO) communication","interference management","optical cell","optical network scalability","resource allocation","visible-light communication (VLC)"]}],"abstract":"Discrete multi-tone (DMT) modulation is known to be an efficient single-transmitter technique for visible-light communication. However, the use of this technique in a multiple transmitter environment requires effective subcarrier and power allocation design in order to exploit the full potential of spatial multiple-transmitter diversity. Spatial reuse of the subcarriers in the presence of interference and power constraints increases the efficiency of multiple access (MA) DMT communication. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that manages interference-constrained subcarrier reuse between different transmitters and power redistribution between different subcarriers in a heuristic manner. The algorithm simulation shows an improvement in the average bit-rate as compared with a conventional DMT method. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed MA-DMT scheme increases with the number of users.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2308282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2308282","startPage":"1594","endPage":"1600","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6759765/06747983.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Access Resource Allocation in Visible Light Communication Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Access Resource Allocation in Visible Light Communication Systems","volume":"32","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14195333","publicationDate":"April15, 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Access Resource Allocation in Visible Light Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-bykhovsky-2308282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043428S","chronDate":"April15,  2014","isNumber":"6759765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"108","articleId":"6747983","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6747988,"authors":[{"name":"Dima Bykhovsky","affiliation":["Electro-optical Engineering Unit, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Dima","lastName":"Bykhovsky","id":"37594033200"},{"name":"Shlomi Arnon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel"],"firstName":"Shlomi","lastName":"Arnon","id":"37271167400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8724"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2213"}],"articleNumber":"6747988","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":798},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Optical Society of America","url":"http://www.osa.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://taes.msubmit.net/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/im/imnew/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","OFDM","Light emitting diodes","Algorithm design and analysis","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel estimation","error statistics","OFDM modulation","optical communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subcarrier number","channel estimation","channel conditions","dc biased optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","adaptive bit-and-power allocation algorithm","bit error-rates","bit-rates","DCO-OFDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit allocation","bit-and-power loading","bit loading","dc-biased optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM)","direct detection","DMT","intensity modulation","LED-based communication","power allocation"]}],"abstract":"This research comprises an end-to-end experimental comparison of the bit-rates and bit error-rates of four major adaptive bit-and-power allocation algorithms for dc biased optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing.

The differential carrier lifetime at threshold is estimated by using the linear relation between the laser linewidth and the bias current that is obtained for below threshold operation.

However, the combined effects of additive noise and convolutive reverberation have been rarely studied in speaker identification (SID). This paper addresses this issue in two phases. We first remove background noise through binary masking using a deep neural network classifier. Then we perform robust SID with speaker models trained in selected reverberant conditions, on the basis of bounded marginalization and direct masking. Evaluation results show that the proposed system substantially improves SID performance over related systems in a wide range of reverberation time and signal-to-noise ratios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Speaker Identification in Noisy and Reverberant Conditions","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2014.2308398","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/6744692/06747994.pdf","startPage":"836","endPage":"845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2014.2308398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6744692","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6747994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6747994/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Robust Speaker Identification in Noisy and Reverberant Conditions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6747994/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14142692","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Speaker Identification in Noisy and Reverberant Conditions","sourcePdf":"taslp-zhao-2308398-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087431S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"6744692","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"6744692","articleId":"6747994","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748000,"authors":[{"name":"Jeyavijayan Rajendran","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, New York University, Brooklyn, NY"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7031983/6748000/6748000-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jeyavijayan (JV) Rajendran is currently working toward the PhD degree in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University.

However, they suffer from process variations like any other nanodevice, which in turn impacts their applicability. The effect of process variations, specifically variation in thickness, is highly non-linear on memristors; the effect is greater near the lower memristance region (near Mon) than in the higher memristance region (near Moff). Due to this non-linear effect, many applications do not use the lower memristance values. Consequently, the application's functionality and performance is affected. In this work, we propose a technique called parallel memristors. In this technique, instead of using a single memristor, the application uses several memristors connected in parallel. Each memristor in this parallel structure is programmed to a higher memristance value to tolerate variations. Since many memristors are connected in parallel, the effective memristance value can be near the Mon value, thereby achieving high-speed operation. We evaluate the parallel memristor technique in two different applications-memristor-based threshold logic and memristor-based memory. We also perform various optimizations to tradeoff between variation tolerance, power, delay, and area.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2014.2308189","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7031983/06748000.pdf","startPage":"733","endPage":"746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2014.2308189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7031983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Tolerance to Variations in Memristor-Based Applications Using Parallel Memristors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748000/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","displayDocTitle":"Improving Tolerance to Variations in Memristor-Based Applications Using Parallel Memristors","volume":"64","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14914329","htmlLink":"/document/6748000/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Tolerance to Variations in Memristor-Based Applications Using Parallel Memristors","sourcePdf":"tc-rajendran-2308189-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142816S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7031983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7031983","articleId":"6748000","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6748003,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Matiz Romero","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Sergio Matiz Romero received the Bachelor of Electronics Engineering degree from Ponticia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia, in 2010.

Source symbols are mapped directly onto channel symbols using space filling curves and then a non-linear stretching function is used to reduce distortion. Different from digital systems, the proposed scheme does not require long block lengths to achieve good performance reducing the complexity of the decoder significantly. This paper focuses on intensity-modulated direct-detection (IM/DD) optical wireless systems. First, a theoretical analysis of the IM/DD wireless optical channel is presented and the prototype communication system designed to transmit data using analog JSCC is introduced. The nonlinearities of the real channel are studied and characterized. A novel technique to mitigate the channel nonlinearities is presented. The performance of the real system follows the simulations and closely approximates the theoretical limits. The proposed system is then used for image transmission by first taking samples of a set of images using compressive sensing and then encoding the measurements using analog JSCC. Both simulation and experimental results are shown.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6781021/06748003.pdf","startPage":"1654","endPage":"1662","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2308136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2308136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6781021","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog Joint Source Channel Coding for Wireless Optical Communications and Image Transmission","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Optical transmitters","Nonlinear optics","Optical receivers","Noise","Channel coding","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined source-channel coding","compressed sensing","image coding","intensity modulation","optical communication","optical modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image encoding","compressive sensing","channel nonlinearities","IM/DD wireless optical channel","intensity-modulated direct-detection optical wireless systems","distortion reduction","nonlinear stretching function","space filling curves","JSCC","image transmission","wireless optical communications","analog joint source channel coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing (CS)","intensity-modulation direct-detection (IM/DD)","joint source channel coding (JSCC)","optical communications","Shannon mappings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Analog Joint Source Channel Coding for Wireless Optical Communications and Image Transmission","volume":"32","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6748003/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14209966","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Joint Source Channel Coding for Wireless Optical Communications and Image Transmission","sourcePdf":"jlt-matizromero-2308136-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07379S","chronDate":"May1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6781021","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6781021","articleId":"6748003","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748005,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Cui","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Cui"},{"name":"Yitang Dai","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yitang","lastName":"Dai"},{"name":"Feifei Yin","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Feifei","lastName":"Yin"},{"name":"Qiang Lv","affiliation":["China Electronics Technology Group Corp, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Lv"},{"name":"Jianqiang Li","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Jianqiang","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Kun Xu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Xu"},{"name":"Jintong Lin","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Jintong","lastName":"Lin"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"6748005","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1599},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"The experimental setup.

Instead of precisely emulating the transfer function of the whole nonlinear system in the digital domain, the key distortion information is directly acquired from hardware. By low biasing the Mach-Zehnder modulator, linearization can be achieved through simply multiplying the distorted signal by the coreceived low-pass band. Theory analysis shows that only the bias angle should be known by the algorithm, whereas the simulation shows adequate tolerance. The low bias angle also results in an improved link gain. The experiment shows a well-suppressed third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3).

A special emphasis is given to the noise which is carefully characterized and minimized along the setup. A semiconductor optical amplifier and an optical switch are used to greatly decrease the intra-band coherent noise of the setup and balanced detection is used to minimize the effects of RIN transferred from the Raman pumps. The sensor was able to detect vibrations of up to 250 Hz (close to the limits set by the time of flight of light pulses) with a resolution of 10 m in a range of 125 km. To achieve the above performance, no post-processing was required in the \u03c6OTDR signal. The evolution of the \u03c6OTDR signal along the fiber is also shown to have a good agreement with the theoretical model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stimulated emission","Noise","Optical fiber sensors","Optical fiber amplifiers","Optical pulses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed sensors","fibre optic sensors","optical noise","optical pumping","optical switches","optical time-domain reflectometry","Raman spectra","reflectometers","semiconductor optical amplifiers","vibration measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometer","first-order Raman amplification","distributed vibration sensing","\u03c6OTDR signal","vibration measurement","semiconductor optical amplifier","optical switch","intraband coherent noise","balanced detection","Raman pumps","light pulse time of flight"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed sensor","Raman scattering","optical fiber sensors","phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR)","vibration sensor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2308354","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6759765/06748011.pdf","startPage":"1510","endPage":"1518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6759765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2308354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-sensitive Optical Time Domain Reflectometer Assisted by First-order Raman Amplification for Distributed Vibration Sensing Over >100 km","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748011","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Phase-sensitive Optical Time Domain Reflectometer Assisted by First-order Raman Amplification for Distributed Vibration Sensing Over >100 km","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748011/","volume":"32","issue":"8","publicationDate":"April15, 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748011/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14178973","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-sensitive Optical Time Domain Reflectometer Assisted by First-order Raman Amplification for Distributed Vibration Sensing Over >100 km","sourcePdf":"jlt-martins-2308354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06478S","chronDate":"April15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6759765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"6759765","articleId":"6748011","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6748013,"authors":[{"name":"Amir Momeni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/7056411/6748013/6748013-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amir Momeni received the BS degree in computer engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, and the MS degree in computer engineering from Shahid Beheshti University, Iran.

Inexact computing is particularly interesting for computer arithmetic designs. This paper deals with the analysis and design of two new approximate 4-2 compressors for utilization in a multiplier. These designs rely on different features of compression, such that imprecision in computation (as measured by the error rate and the so-called normalized error distance) can meet with respect to circuit-based figures of merit of a design (number of transistors, delay and power consumption). Four different schemes for utilizing the proposed approximate compressors are proposed and analyzed for a Dadda multiplier. Extensive simulation results are provided and an application of the approximate multipliers to image processing is presented. The results show that the proposed designs accomplish significant reductions in power dissipation, delay and transistor count compared to an exact design; moreover, two of the proposed multiplier designs provide excellent capabilities for image multiplication with respect to average normalized error distance and peak signal-to-noise ratio (more than 50 dB for the considered image examples).","doi":"10.1109/TC.2014.2308214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7056411","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2014.2308214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7056411/06748013.pdf","startPage":"984","endPage":"994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of Approximate Compressors for Multiplication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Approximate Compressors for Multiplication","volume":"64","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2015","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748013/","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"14982413","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748013/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Approximate Compressors for Multiplication","sourcePdf":"tc-lombardi-2308214-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104637S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7056411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"218","xplore-issue":"7056411","articleId":"6748013","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6748015,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Kerber","affiliation":["Globalfoundries, Inc., Yorktown Heights, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Kerber","id":"37282748000"},{"name":"Purushothaman Srinivasan","affiliation":["Globalfoundries, Inc., Malta, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Purushothaman","lastName":"Srinivasan","id":"37409317400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6748015","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":450},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","CMOS integrated circuits","Logic gates","Threshold voltage","Field effect transistors","Correlation","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","high-k dielectric thin films","integrated circuit modelling","integrated circuit reliability","negative bias temperature instability","SRAM chips","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["\u03c3-value","stress mode","stochastic bias temperature instability","stochastic BTI modeling","scaled metal gate-high-k CMOS devices","SRAM circuit functionality","threshold voltage distribution","constant overdrive stress","constant voltage stress","reliability guidance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bias temperature instability","variability","metal gate","high-$k$ dielectrics","CMOS devices"]}],"abstract":"Stochastic bias temperature instability (BTI) modeling has gained importance for scaled metal gate/high- k CMOS devices to ensure SRAM circuit functionality.

However, due to inherent nature of flash memories, update-intensive workloads cause the flash disk fragmented, and trigger costly internal activities such as cleaning and wear leveling. We use database transaction processing as a motivating update-intensive workload. Our studies based on a flash disk simulator as well as flash disks show that, these activities result in significant overhead to the I/O response time and system throughput. To resolve the impact of internal activities, we propose dynamic page replications to exploit the multi-chip parallelism on the flash disk. Specifically, we replicate the frequently blocked data pages to improve the data availability even when internal activities block the request. To reduce the overhead of replications, we take advantage of the idle periods in the flash chips for the I/O operations by writes to replicas or reads from replicas, and further develop a prediction model for the decisions on those I/O operations to minimize the interference to normal I/O operations. We evaluate our techniques with three public transaction benchmarks in the simulator as well as on the real flash disks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our replication management on improving I/O response time and system throughput.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Update-Intensive Workloads on

Supporting variable channel width has been considered one of the most critical features of a communication radio. How to leverage a channel-width adaptive radio to improve throughput of a wireless network is a challenging problem in the medium access control (MAC) layer. So far, there exist research results on either theoretical analysis or protocol implementation for a point-to-multipoint (PMP) infrastructure network. However, the impact of channel width to a multihop wireless network has not been fully investigated yet. More specifically, how to exploit variable channel width to enhance throughput of a multihop wireless network remains an unresolved research issue. This paper addresses this issue in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) considering orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA)-based channel-width adaptation. Theoretical analysis is first carried out to identify appropriate algorithms for channel width adaptation. To this end, resource allocation with OFDMA-based channel-width adaptation is formulated as an optimization problem, which is proved to be NP-complete. To reduce the computational complexity, a greedy algorithm is derived to obtain a suboptimal solution. Based on such a greedy algorithm, a distributed MAC protocol is designed for channel-width adaptation for OFDMA-based WMNs. It takes advantage of variable channel width in different time slots to achieve highly efficient resource allocation. Simulation results illustrate that the distributed MAC protocol significantly outperforms MAC protocols based on traditional channel-width adaptation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6923505/06748024.pdf","startPage":"4039","endPage":"4052","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2308316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2308316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923505","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDMA-Based Channel-Width Adaptation in Wireless Mesh Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Interference","Greedy algorithms","Throughput","OFDM","Wireless networks","Media Access Protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","channel allocation","greedy algorithms","OFDM modulation","optimisation","resource allocation","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless communication link","variable channel width","communication radio","channel-width adaptive radio","medium access control layer","MAC layer","point-to-multipoint infrastructure network","PMP infrastructure network","multihop wireless network","wireless mesh networks","WMN","orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access","OFDMA-based channel-width adaptation","resource allocation","optimization problem","greedy algorithm","distributed MAC protocol"]},{"kwd":["Channel-width adaptation","distributed medium access control (MAC) protocol","wireless mesh networks (WMNs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"OFDMA-Based Channel-Width Adaptation in Wireless Mesh Networks","volume":"63","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6748024/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665015","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61172066"},{"fundingName":"Oriental Scholar Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Pujiang Scholar Program","grantNumber":"10PJ1406100"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDMA-Based Channel-Width Adaptation in Wireless Mesh Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2308316-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121578S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6923505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6923505","articleId":"6748024","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748027,"authors":[{"name":"Dezhi Xu","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6748027/xu-2308161-small.gif","p":["\nDezhi Xu received the B.S. degree from the North University of China,\nTaiyuan, China, the M.S. degree from the Lanzhou University of Technology, Lanzhou, China, and the Ph.D. degree from the\nNanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China.","He is currently a Lecturer with the Nanjing Institute of Technology, Nanjing, China.

We propose a new stochastic model to characterize the traffic generated by a Multiview Video Coding (MVC) variable bit-rate source. To this aim, we resort to a Poisson hidden Markov model (P-HMM), in which the first (hidden) layer represents the evolution of the video activity and the second layer represents the frame sizes of the multiple encoded views. We propose a method for estimating the model parameters in long MVC sequences. We then present extensive numerical simulations assessing the model's ability to produce traffic with realistic characteristics for a general class of MVC sequences. We then extend our framework to network applications where we show that our model is able to accurately describe the sender and receiver buffers behavior in MVC transmission. Finally, we derive a model of user behavior for interactive view selection, which, in conjunction with our traffic model, is able to accurately predict actual network load in interactive multiview services.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2014.2303162","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7086110/06748028.pdf","startPage":"547","endPage":"558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2014.2303162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7086110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Poisson Hidden Markov Model for Multiview Video Traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748028","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748028/","displayDocTitle":"A Poisson Hidden Markov Model for Multiview Video Traffic","volume":"23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15057720","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748028/","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Poisson Hidden Markov Model for Multiview Video Traffic","sourcePdf":"tnet-rossi-2303162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081637S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7086110","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7086110","articleId":"6748028","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748029,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The proposed array consists of a novel multicoil inductive link, whose primary resonator is made of several identical coil elements connected in parallel and arranged in an array. Such a structure presents several key features compared to previous inductive coil arrays. The proposed approach can do the following: 1) deliver power with superior efficiency over longer separation distances; 2) naturally track the receiver position and localize transmitted power through nearby coil array elements without the need for complex control and detection circuitry; and 3) accommodate either short- or long-range power transmission applications simply by slightly modifying the receiver topology. The performance of the proposed structure is verified by measurement results. In a three-coil configuration, the prototype provides a power transfer efficiency (PTE) of 83.3% and a power delivered to the load (PDL) of 3.87 W for a separation distance below 1 cm, while in a four-coil configuration, it provides a PTE of 76% and a PDL of 115 mW for a separation distance of 4 cm.","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/06748029.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6827271/06748029.pdf","startPage":"6061","endPage":"6070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2308138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2308138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6827271","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Smart Multicoil Inductively Coupled Array for Wireless Power Transmission","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Arrays","Receivers","Couplings","Prototypes","Topology","Power transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coils","inductive power transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PTE","power transfer efficiency","wireless power transmission","smart multicoil inductively coupled array","three-coil configuration","receiver topology","long-range power transmission applications","short-range power transmission applications","receiver position","separation distances","identical coil elements","primary resonator","multicoil inductive link","resonance-based multicoil array structure"]},{"kwd":["Free positioning","implantable devices","multicoil inductive link","power delivery to the load","power localization","power transfer efficiency (PTE)","wireless power transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Smart Multicoil Inductively Coupled Array for Wireless Power Transmission","volume":"61","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6748029/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14363502","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003151","fundingName":"Fonds de recherche du Qu\u00e9bec-Nature et technologies"},{"fundingName":"Microsystems Strategic Alliance of Quebec"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Smart Multicoil Inductively Coupled Array for Wireless Power Transmission","sourcePdf":"tie-mirbozorgi-2308138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108207S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6827271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6827271","articleId":"6748029","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748030,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongqi Li","affiliation":["Qualcomm Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7014337/6748030/li-2300477-small.gif","p":["Zhongqi Li received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2006 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA, in 2012.","He is currently with Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, as an Adreno GPU Performance Architect for the Snapdragon mobile processor.

It is expected that photonic NoCs will play an important role in alleviating current power, latency, and bandwidth constraints. However, photonic NoCs are sensitive to ambient temperature variations because their basic constituents, ring resonators, are themselves sensitive to those variations. Since ring resonators are basic building blocks for photonic modulators, switches, multiplexers, and demultiplexers, variations of on-chip temperature pose serious challenges to the proper operation of photonic NoCs. Proposed methods that mitigate the effects of temperature at the device level are either difficult to use in CMOS processes or not suitable for large scale implementation. In this paper, we propose Aurora, a thermally resilient photonic NoC architecture design that supports reliable and low bit error rate (BER) on-chip communications in the presence of large temperature variations. Our proposed architecture leverages cross-layer solutions at the device, architecture, and operating system (OS) layers that individually provide considerable improvements and synergistically provide even more significant improvements. To compensate for small temperature variations, our design varies the bias current through ring resonators. For larger temperature variations, we propose architecture-level techniques to reroute messages away from hot regions, and through cooler regions, to their destinations. We also propose a thermal/congestion-aware coscheduling algorithm at the OS level to further lower BER by reorganizing the thermal profile of the chip. Our simulation results show that Aurora provides a robust architectural solution to handle temperature variation effects on future photonic NoCs. For instance, average BER and message error rate are reduced by 96% and 85%, respectively, when the combined thermal optimization scheme [shortest path first+ OS] is applied. From the perspective of power efficiency, Aurora is also superior to conventional photonic NoC architectures by as much as 37%.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2300477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2300477","startPage":"170","endPage":"183","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7014337/06748030.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7014337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aurora: A Cross-Layer Solution for Thermally Resilient Photonic Network-on-Chip","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Aurora: A Cross-Layer Solution for Thermally Resilient Photonic Network-on-Chip","volume":"23","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14869974","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6748030/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"1117261, 0937869, 0916384, 0845721, 0834288, 0811611 and 0720476"},{"fundingName":"Microsoft Research Trustworthy Computing, Safe and Scalable Multicore Computing Awards"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aurora: A Cross-Layer Solution for Thermally Resilient Photonic Network-on-Chip","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-li-2300477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13329S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7014337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7014337","articleId":"6748030","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":6748034,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Micallef","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Electrical Power Conversion, University of Malta, MSD, Malta"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6800037/6748034/6748034-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexander Micallef (s'09) received the B.Eng.

Traditional droop control enables the decentralized regulation of the local voltage and frequency of the microgrid by the inverters. The droop method also enables the inverters to share the real and reactive power required by the loads. This paper focuses on some of the limitations of parallel islanded single phase inverters using droop control. Algorithms with the aim to address the following limitations in islanded operation were proposed: reactive power sharing and reduction of the voltage harmonic distortion at the point of common coupling (PCC). Experimental results were then presented to show the suitability of the proposed algorithms in achieving reactive power sharing and in improving the voltage harmonic distortion at the PCC.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2013.2291912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2013.2291912","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/6800037/06748034.pdf","startPage":"1149","endPage":"1158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reactive Power Sharing and Voltage Harmonic Distortion Compensation of Droop Controlled Single Phase Islanded Microgrids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Reactive Power Sharing and Voltage Harmonic Distortion Compensation of Droop Controlled Single Phase Islanded Microgrids","volume":"5","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","dateOfInsertion":"17 April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748034/","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14239040","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748034/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reactive Power Sharing and Voltage Harmonic Distortion Compensation of Droop Controlled Single Phase Islanded Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tsg-micallef-2291912-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079351S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"6800037","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"6800037","articleId":"6748034","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6748039,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6960135/6748039/liu-2305717-small.gif","p":["Zhi Liu received the B.S. degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, the M.S. degree from Hunan University, Changsha, China, and the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, all in electrical engineering, in 1997, 2000, and 2004, respectively.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.

Because of the larger power density and the heterogeneous thermal conductance in different silicon layers of 3D NoC, the thermal problems of 3D NoC become more exacerbated than that of 2D NoC and become a major design constraint for a high-performance system. To control the system temperature under a certain thermal limit, many Dynamic Thermal Managements (DTMs) have been proposed. Recently, for emergent cooling, the full throttling scheme is usually employed as the system temperature reaches the alarming level. Hence, the conventional reactive DTM suffers from significant performance impact because of the pessimistic reaction. In this paper, we propose a throttle-based proactive DTM(T-PDTM) scheme to predict the future temperature through a new Thermal RC-based temperature prediction (RCTP) model. The RCTP model can precisely predict the temperature with heterogeneous workload assignment with low constant computational complexity. Based on the predictive temperature, the proposed T-PDTM scheme will assign the suitable clock frequency for each node of the NoC system to perform early temperature control through power budget distribution. Based on the experimental results, compared with the conventional reactive throttled-based DTMs, the T-PDTM scheme can help to reduce 11.4~80.3 percent fully throttled nodes and improves the network throughput by around 1.5~211.8 percent.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308206","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6980150/06748042.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RC-Based Temperature Prediction Scheme for Proactive Dynamic Thermal Management in Throttle-Based 3D NoCs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748042/","displayDocTitle":"RC-Based Temperature Prediction Scheme for Proactive Dynamic Thermal Management in Throttle-Based 3D NoCs","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"1 Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14840529","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748042/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council","grantNumber":"NSC 102-2220-E-002-001 and 100-2221-E-002-091-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RC-Based Temperature Prediction Scheme for Proactive Dynamic Thermal Management in Throttle-Based 3D NoCs","sourcePdf":"tpds-chen-2308206-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128675S","chronDate":"Jan. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6980150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6980150","articleId":"6748042","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748043,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoshan Kai","affiliation":["Hefei University of Technology, School of Mathematics, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaoshan Kai received the M.S. degree in mathematics from Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2007 and the Ph.D. degree in management informatics from Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2011.","Currently, he is an Associate Professor with the School of Mathematics, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China.

In this paper, we investigate in detail the decorrelation by resampling technique and a proper design strategy for sub-band resampling (SBR), which permits finely tuned, frequency specific control of the trade-off between decorrelation, measured in terms of the (magnitude-squared) coherence, and audio quality, evaluated in terms of objective speech quality measures and a subjective listening test. Our most recent study provides a deep analysis of the performance bounds of the resampling procedure by analyzing the relationship between resampling, coherence, and achievable steady-state misalignment. We provide a novel, theoretically justifiable, and perceptually motivated strategy for SBR to achieve a fast multi-channel AEC convergence rate while maintaining the highest audio quality when compared to other conventional decorrelation procedures.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2307831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2307831","startPage":"2127","endPage":"2142","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6774528/06748044.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inter-Channel Decorrelation by Sub-Band Resampling for Multi-Channel Acoustic Echo Cancellation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2014","displayDocTitle":"Inter-Channel Decorrelation by Sub-Band Resampling for Multi-Channel Acoustic Echo Cancellation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April15, 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","volume":"62","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748044/","accessionNumber":"14180804","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748044/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inter-Channel Decorrelation by Sub-Band Resampling for Multi-Channel Acoustic Echo Cancellation","sourcePdf":"tsp-wung-2307831-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084106S","chronDate":"April15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6774528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6774528","articleId":"6748044","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6748051,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Tarisciotti","affiliation":["Power Electronics, Machines and Control Group, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6748051/taris-2308139-small.gif","p":["\nLuca Tarisciotti (M'12) received the master's degree in electronic\nengineering from the University of Rome \u201cTor Vergata\u201d, Rome, Italy, in 2009.

The aim of the proposed technique is to minimize the DC-Link voltage unbalance, independently from the amplitude of the DC-Link voltage reference, and compensate the switching device voltage drops and on-state resistances. Such compensation can be used to achieve an increase in the waveform quality of the converter. This is particularly useful in high-power low supply voltage applications where a low switching frequency is used. The DC-Link voltage balancing capability of the method removes the requirement for additional control loops to actively balance the DC-Link voltage on each H-Bridge, simplifying the control structure. The proposed modulation technique has been validated through the use of simulation and extensive experimental testing to confirm its effectiveness.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Voltage control","Switching frequency","Voltage measurement","Switches","Resistance","Rectifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM power convertors","switching convertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active DC voltage balancing","pulse width modulation technique","PWM technique","high-power cascaded multilevel converters","single-phase converters","four wire three-phase converters","multilevel cascaded H-bridge converters","DC-link voltage unbalance","DC-link voltage reference","switching device voltage","on-state resistances","waveform quality","control loops","control structure"]},{"kwd":["Multilevel converters","predictive control","smart grid"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2308139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6827271/06748051.pdf","startPage":"6157","endPage":"6167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6827271","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2308139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active DC Voltage Balancing PWM Technique for High-Power Cascaded Multilevel Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Active DC Voltage Balancing PWM Technique for High-Power Cascaded Multilevel Converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748051/","volume":"61","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748051/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14351651","dateOfInsertion":"06 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active DC Voltage Balancing PWM Technique for High-Power Cascaded Multilevel Converters","sourcePdf":"tie-tarisciotti-2308139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152425S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6827271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6827271","articleId":"6748051","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-27"},{"_id":6748054,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6980150/6748054/6748054-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hong Liu is currently working toward the PhD degree at the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, China.

Cloud services provide great conveniences for the users to enjoy the on-demand cloud applications without considering the local infrastructure limitations. During the data accessing, different users may be in a collaborative relationship, and thus data sharing becomes significant to achieve productive benefits. The existing security solutions mainly focus on the authentication to realize that a user's privative data cannot be illegally accessed, but neglect a subtle privacy issue during a user challenging the cloud server to request other users for data sharing. The challenged access request itself may reveal the user's privacy no matter whether or not it can obtain the data access permissions. In this paper, we propose a shared authority based privacy-preserving authentication protocol (SAPA) to address above privacy issue for cloud storage. In the SAPA, 1) shared access authority is achieved by anonymous access request matching mechanism with security and privacy considerations (e.g., authentication, data anonymity, user privacy, and forward security); 2) attribute based access control is adopted to realize that the user can only access its own data fields; 3) proxy re-encryption is applied to provide data sharing among the multiple users. Meanwhile, universal composability (UC) model is established to prove that the SAPA theoretically has the design correctness. It indicates that the proposed protocol is attractive for multi-user collaborative cloud applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shared Authority Based Privacy-Preserving Authentication Protocol in Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308218","startPage":"241","endPage":"251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6980150/06748054.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Shared Authority Based Privacy-Preserving Authentication Protocol in Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6748054/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14840531","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shared Authority Based Privacy-Preserving Authentication Protocol in Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tpds-ning-2308218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167685S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6980150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6980150","articleId":"6748054","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748055,"authors":[{"name":"Kenli Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, P.R.

This method has wide adaptability for different types of sparse matrices and is different from existing methods which only adapt to some particular sparse matrices. In addition, our method does not need additional benchmarks to get optimized parameters, which are calculated directly through the probability mass function (PMF). We make the following contributions. (1) We present a PMF to analyze precisely the distribution pattern of non-zero elements in a sparse matrix. The PMF can provide theoretical basis for the compression of a sparse matrix. (2) Compression efficiency of COO, CSR, ELL, and HYB can be analyzed precisely through the PMF, and combined with the hardware parameters of GPU, the performance of SpMV based on COO, CSR, ELL, and HYB can be estimated. Furthermore, the most appropriate format for SpMV can be selected according to estimated value of the performance. Experiments prove that the theoretical estimated values and the tested values have high consistency. (3) For HYB, the optimal segmentation threshold can be found through the PMF to achieve the optimal performance for SpMV. Our performance modeling and analysis are very accurate. The order of magnitude of the estimated speedup and that of the tested speedup for each of the ten tested sparse matrices based on the three formats COO, CSR, and ELL are the same. The percentage of relative difference between an estimated value and a tested value is less than 20 percent for over 80 percent cases. The performance improvement of our algorithm is also effective. The average performance improvement of the optimal solution for HYB is over 15 percent compared with that of the automatic solution provided by CUSPARSE lib.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6980150/06748055.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980150","startPage":"196","endPage":"205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis and Optimization for SpMV on GPU Using Probabilistic Modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis and Optimization for SpMV on GPU Using Probabilistic Modeling","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748055/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14840532","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6748055/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis and Optimization for SpMV on GPU Using Probabilistic Modeling","sourcePdf":"tpds-yang-2308221-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115167S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6980150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"6980150","articleId":"6748055","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748057,"authors":[{"name":"Shen Yin","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6994311/6748057/yin-2308133-small.gif","p":["\nShen Yin (M'12) received the B.E. degree in automation from\nHarbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2004 and the M.Sc. degree in control and information system and the\nPh.D. degree in electrical engineering and information technology from the University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen,\nGermany.","He is currently with the Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems at Harbin Institute of Technology.

As one of the hottest research topics for complicated processes, the data-based techniques have been rapidly developed over the past two decades and widely used in numerous industrial sectors nowadays. The core of data-based techniques is to take full advantage of the huge amounts of available process data, aiming to acquire the useful information within. Compared with the well-developed model-based approaches, data-based techniques provide efficient alternative solutions for different industrial issues under various operating conditions. The main objective of this paper is to review and summarize the recent achievements in data-based techniques, especially for complicated industrial applications, thus providing a referee for further study on the related topics both from academic and practical points of view. This paper begins with a brief evolutionary overview of data-based techniques in the last two decades. Then, the methodologies only based on process measurements and the model-data integrated techniques will be further introduced.

To exploit the benefits of both MIMO radar and phased array, a waveform covariance matrix is proposed. To generate the proposed covariance matrix, the values of the cosine function between 0 and \u03c0 with a step size of \u03c0/nT are used to form a positive semi-definite Toeplitz matrix, where nT is the number of transmit antennas. The proposed covariance matrix yields gain in the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) compared to MIMO radar and have lower sidelobe levels (SLLs) compared to phased-array, MIMO-radar, and the recently proposed phased-MIMO scheme. Moreover, in contrast to the phased-MIMO scheme, where each antenna transmits a different power, our proposed scheme allows same power transmission from each antenna. Simulation results validate our analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2307282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6774528/06748061.pdf","startPage":"2056","endPage":"2065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2307282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-Radar Waveform Covariance Matrix for High SINR and Low Side-Lobe Levels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748061/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-Radar Waveform Covariance Matrix for High SINR and Low Side-Lobe Levels","volume":"62","issue":"8","publicationDate":"April15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14180806","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748061/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-Radar Waveform Covariance Matrix for High SINR and Low Side-Lobe Levels","sourcePdf":"tsp-ahmed-2307282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074025S","chronDate":"April15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6774528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6774528","articleId":"6748061","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748063,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuo Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6748063/wang-2308146-small.gif","p":["\nZhuo Wang received the B.E. degree in automation from Beihang University,\nBeijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago,\nChicago, IL, USA.","He is currently a Post Doctoral Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of\nAlberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.

As existing anomaly detection techniques usually operate in a point-based manner that handles each observation individually, they are unable to reliably and efficiently report such long-term anomalies appeared in an individual sensor node. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on a new technique for handling data in a segment-based manner. Considering a collection of neighbouring data segments as random variables, we determine those behaving abnormally by exploiting their spatial predictabilities and, motivated by spatial analysis, specifically investigate how to implement a prediction variance detector in a WSN. As the communication cost incurred in aggregating a covariance matrix is finally optimised using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and differential compression, the proposed scheme is able to efficiently detect a wide range of long-term anomalies. In theory, comparing to the regular centralised approach, it can reduce the communication cost by approximately 80 percent. Moreover, its effectiveness is demonstrated by the numerical experiments, with a real world data set collected by the Intel Berkeley Research Lab (IBRL).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Segment-Based Anomaly Detection with Approximated Sample Covariance Matrix in Wireless Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308198","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7010070/06748064.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7010070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748064","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748064/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Segment-Based Anomaly Detection with Approximated Sample Covariance Matrix in Wireless Sensor Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2015","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14863864","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Segment-Based Anomaly Detection with Approximated Sample Covariance Matrix in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tpds-hu-2308198-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066442S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","isNumber":"7010070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"25","articleId":"6748064","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748065,"authors":[{"name":"Filbert H.

In this paper, we propose a food calorie and nutrition measurement system that can help patients and dietitians to measure and manage daily food intake. Our system is built on food image processing and uses nutritional fact tables. Recently, there has been an increase in the usage of personal mobile technology such as smartphones or tablets, which users carry with them practically all the time. Via a special calibration technique, our system uses the built-in camera of such mobile devices and records a photo of the food before and after eating it to measure the consumption of calorie and nutrient components. Our results show that the accuracy of our system is acceptable and it will greatly improve and facilitate current manual calorie measurement techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2014.2303533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/6851964/06748066.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2014.2303533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6851964","startPage":"1947","endPage":"1956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measuring Calorie and Nutrition From Food Image","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Measuring Calorie and Nutrition From Food Image","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748066/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14432032","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6748066/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measuring Calorie and Nutrition From Food Image","sourcePdf":"tim-pouladzadeh-2303533-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078952S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6851964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"6851964","articleId":"6748066","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6748067,"authors":[{"name":"Unai Lopez-Novoa","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Group, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU.

Such mechanisms enable the cloud providers to effectively utilize their available resources and obtain higher profits. Recently, cloud providers have introduced auction-based models for VM provisioning and allocation which allow users to submit bids for their requested VMs. We formulate the dynamic VM provisioning and allocation problem for the auction-based model as an integer program considering multiple types of resources. We then design truthful greedy and optimal mechanisms for the problem such that the cloud provider provisions VMs based on the requests of the winning users and determines their payments. We show that the proposed mechanisms are truthful, that is, the users do not have incentives to manipulate the system by lying about their requested bundles of VM instances and their valuations. We perform extensive experiments using real workload traces in order to investigate the performance of the proposed mechanisms. Our proposed mechanisms achieve promising results in terms of revenue for the cloud provider.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Truthful Greedy Mechanisms for Dynamic Virtual Machine Provisioning and Allocation in Clouds","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308224","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7010070/06748071.pdf","startPage":"594","endPage":"603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7010070","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748071/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Truthful Greedy Mechanisms for Dynamic Virtual Machine Provisioning and Allocation in Clouds","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6748071/","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14863866","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Truthful Greedy Mechanisms for Dynamic Virtual Machine Provisioning and Allocation in Clouds","sourcePdf":"tpds-grosu-2308224-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08341S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7010070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7010070","articleId":"6748071","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748079,"authors":[{"name":"Dinh-Hoan Trinh","affiliation":["Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, Center for Informatics and Computing, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6742656/6748079/6748079-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dinh-Hoan Trinh received the B.S. degree in mathematics education from the Vietnam National University, Hanoi, the M.S. degree in mathematics from the Hanoi Institute of Mathematics, and the Ph.D. degree in signal and image processing from the Laboratoire Analyse, G\u00e9om\u00e9trie et Applications, Universit\u00e9 Paris 13, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, France, in 2005, 2008, and 2013, respectively.

The objective is to estimate a high-resolution image from a single noisy low-resolution image, with the help of a given database of high and low-resolution image patch pairs. Denoising and super-resolution in this paper is performed on each image patch. For each given input low-resolution patch, its high-resolution version is estimated based on finding a nonnegative sparse linear representation of the input patch over the low-resolution patches from the database, where the coefficients of the representation strongly depend on the similarity between the input patch and the sample patches in the database. The problem of finding the nonnegative sparse linear representation is modeled as a nonnegative quadratic programming problem. The proposed method is especially useful for the case of noise-corrupted and low-resolution image. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art super-resolution methods while effectively removing noise.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2308422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6742656/06748079.pdf","startPage":"1882","endPage":"1895","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2308422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Example-Based Method for Super-Resolution and Denoising of Medical Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Novel Example-Based Method for Super-Resolution and Denoising of Medical Images","volume":"23","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6748079/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14155467","dateOfInsertion":"14 March 2014","pubMedId":"24808354","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748079/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Example-Based Method for Super-Resolution and Denoising of Medical Images","sourcePdf":"tip-luong-2308422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095919S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6742656","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6742656","articleId":"6748079","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-08"},{"_id":6748082,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Hayati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6917239/6748082/6748082-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohsen Hayati received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Nagarjuna University, Guntur, India, in 1985, and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from Delhi University, Delhi, India, in 1987 and 1992, respectively.","He joined the Department of Electrical Engineering, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran, as an Assistant Professor in 1993, and currently, as an Associate Professor.

The Class-E/F 3 amplifier with nonoptimum condition increases one design degree of freedom compared with the optimum conditions. Because of the increase in the design degree of freedom, one more relationship can be specified as a design specification. The following parameters series reactance, peak switch voltage, output power capability, and maximum operating frequency are presented. Based on analytical results, an example of the Class E/F 3 at operating frequency of 4 MHz is analyzed. The PSpice simulation and measured results agree with the analytical expressions, which show the validity of our analytical expressions at zero-voltage switching.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2308280","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2308280","startPage":"727","endPage":"734","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6917239/06748082.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6917239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Analysis of Class E/F- Power Amplifier with Nonlinear Shunt Capacitance at Nonoptimum Operation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Design and Analysis of Class E/F<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$_{\\bf 3}$</tex></formula> Power Amplifier with Nonlinear Shunt Capacitance at Nonoptimum Operation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2014","volume":"30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748082/","accessionNumber":"14648190","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748082/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Analysis of Class E/F<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$_{\\bf 3}$</tex></formula> Power Amplifier with Nonlinear Shunt Capacitance at Nonoptimum Operation","sourcePdf":"tpel-hayati-2308280-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069725S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6917239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6917239","articleId":"6748082","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6748083,"authors":[{"name":"Kalle Ilves","affiliation":["Electrical Energy Conversion (E2C), Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6883248/6748083/6748083-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kalle Ilves (S\u201910) received the M.Sc. and Licentiate degrees in electrical engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

Typically, a reduced switching frequency will increase the spread in the capacitor voltages and, thus, the voltage ripple in the individual submodules. This paper presents a capacitor voltage balancing strategy which aims to combine a low switching frequency with a low capacitor-voltage ripple. This is done by a predictive algorithm that controls the converter in such a way that the stored charge in the submodule capacitors is evenly distributed among all the submodules when the capacitor voltages reach their maximum values. In this way, it is possible to limit the peak voltages in the submodule capacitors at switching frequencies as low as 2-3 times the fundamental switching frequency. The proposed capacitor voltage balancing strategy is validated by both simulations and experimental results with 130-Hz and 140-Hz switching frequency. In the simulations, the capacitor voltage ripple was reduced by 24% compared to the case when a conventional sorting algorithm is used, and the experimental results show that it is possible to combine the proposed voltage balancing strategy with a circulating-current controller.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6883248/06748083.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"449","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2308018","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2308018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6883248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive Sorting Algorithm for Modular Multilevel Converters Minimizing the Spread in the Submodule Capacitor Voltages","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Switching frequency","Energy storage","Voltage control","Modulation","Sorting","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVDC power convertors","power capacitors","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive sorting algorithm","modular multilevel converters","submodule capacitor voltages","capacitor voltage balancing strategy","low switching frequency","low capacitor-voltage ripple","circulating-current controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacitor voltage balancing","modular multilevel converter (MMC)","switching frequency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748083/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Predictive Sorting Algorithm for Modular Multilevel Converters Minimizing the Spread in the Submodule Capacitor Voltages","volume":"30","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6748083/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14543399","dateOfInsertion":"26 August 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive Sorting Algorithm for Modular Multilevel Converters Minimizing the Spread in the Submodule Capacitor Voltages","sourcePdf":"tpel-ilves-2308018-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055312S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6883248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"6883248","articleId":"6748083","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6748087,"authors":[{"name":"Evaggelia V.

The few known techniques produce only a small number of such frames while imposing certain restrictions on frame dimensions. Motivated by the application of incoherent tight frames in compressed sensing (CS), we propose a methodology to construct incoherent UNTFs. When frame redundancy is not very high, the achieved maximal column correlation becomes close to the lowest possible bound. The proposed methodology may construct frames of any dimensions. The obtained frames are employed in CS to produce optimized projection matrices. Experimental results show that the proposed optimization technique improves CS signal recovery, increasing the reconstruction accuracy. Considering that the UNTFs and ETFs are important in sparse representations, channel coding, and communications, we expect that the proposed construction will be useful in other applications, besides the CS.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6766686/06748087.pdf","startPage":"2319","endPage":"2330","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2308171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2308171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766686","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Construction of Incoherent Unit Norm Tight Frames With Application to Compressed Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Redundancy","Vectors","Coherence","Dictionaries","Correlation","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","compressed sensing","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incoherent unit norm tight frames","incoherent UNTF","compressed sensing","CS","equiangular tight frames","ETF","frame redundancy","maximal column correlation","projection matrices","sparse representations","channel coding","communications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unit norm tight frames","Grassmannian frames","compressed sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Construction of Incoherent Unit Norm Tight Frames With Application to Compressed Sensing","volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6748087/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14159205","dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Construction of Incoherent Unit Norm Tight Frames With Application to Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tit-tsiligianni-2308171-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134861S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6766686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6766686","articleId":"6748087","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748092,"authors":[{"name":"Haifeng Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Fuzhou University, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/6980150/6748092/6748092-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haifeng Zheng received the BE and ME degrees both in communication engineering from Fuzhou University, China.

Unlike the conventional approaches, which require uniform sampling in the traditional CS theory, we propose a random walk algorithm for data gathering in WSNs. However, such an approach will conform to path constraints in networks and result in the non-uniform selection of measurements. It is still unknown whether such a non-uniform method can be used for CS to recover sparse signals in WSNs. In this paper, from the perspectives of CS theory and graph theory, we provide mathematical foundations to allow random measurements to be collected in a random walk based manner. We find that the random matrix constructed from our random walk algorithm can satisfy the expansion property of expander graphs. The theoretical analysis shows that a k-sparse signal can be recovered using `1 minimization decoding algorithm when it takes m = O(k log(n=k)) independent random walks with the length of each walk t = O(n=k) in a random geometric network with n nodes. We also carry out simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly reduce communication cost compared to the conventional schemes using dense random projections and sparse random projections, indicating that our scheme can be a more practical alternative for data gathering applications in WSNs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Gathering with Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensor Networks: A Random Walk Based Approach","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308212","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/6980150/06748092.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"44","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308212","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980150","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748092/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Data Gathering with Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensor Networks: A Random Walk Based Approach","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6748092/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14840540","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Gathering with Compressive Sensing in Wireless Sensor Networks: A Random Walk Based Approach","sourcePdf":"tpds-wang-2308212-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092704S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"6980150","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"6980150","articleId":"6748092","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748095,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Information and Systems, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7057627/6748095/6748095-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jie Li (M\u201996-SM\u201904) received the BE degree in computer science from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, the ME degree in electronic engineering and communication systems from China Academy of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China.

On the other hand, vehicles have to be protected from the misuse of their private data and the attacks on their privacy, as well as to be capable of being investigated for accidents or liabilities from non-repudiation. In this paper, we investigate the authentication issues with privacy preservation and non-repudiation in VANETs. We propose a novel framework with preservation and repudiation (ACPN) for VANETs. In ACPN, we introduce the public-key cryptography (PKC) to the pseudonym generation, which ensures legitimate third parties to achieve the non-repudiation of vehicles by obtaining vehicles' real IDs. The self-generated PKCbased pseudonyms are also used as identifiers instead of vehicle IDs for the privacy-preserving authentication, while the update of the pseudonyms depends on vehicular demands. The existing ID-based signature (IBS) scheme and the ID-based online/offline signature (IBOOS) scheme are used, for the authentication between the road side units (RSUs) and vehicles, and the authentication among vehicles, respectively. Authentication, privacy preservation, non-repudiation and other objectives of ACPN have been analyzed for VANETs. Typical performance evaluation has been conducted using efficient IBS and IBOOS schemes. We show that the proposed ACPN is feasible and adequate to be used efficiently in the VANET environment.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ACPN: A Novel Authentication Framework with Conditional Privacy-Preservation and Non-Repudiation for VANETs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308215","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7057627/06748095.pdf","startPage":"938","endPage":"948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7057627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748095/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"ACPN: A Novel Authentication Framework with Conditional Privacy-Preservation and Non-Repudiation for VANETs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6748095/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"14982673","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ACPN: A Novel Authentication Framework with Conditional Privacy-Preservation and Non-Repudiation for VANETs","sourcePdf":"tpds-li-2308215-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067679S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7057627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"7057627","articleId":"6748095","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6748096,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Zhao","affiliation":["Software and Multimedia, Beijing University of Posts and Telecomm., Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7010070/6748096/6748096-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Zhao received the BS degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Henan University, China, in 2008.

Most of existing mobile sensing applications consider users reporting and accessing sensing data through the Internet. However, this approach cannot be applied in the scenarios with poor network coverage or expensive network access. Existing data forwarding schemes for mobile opportunistic networks are not sufficient for sensing applications as spatial-temporal correlation among sensory data has not been explored. In order to build sensing maps satisfying specific sensing quality with low delay and energy consumption, we design COUPON, a novel cooperative sensing and data forwarding framework. We first notice that cooperative sensing scheme can eliminate sampling redundancy and hence save energy. Then we design two cooperative forwarding schemes by leveraging data fusion: Epidemic Routing with Fusion (ERF) and Binary Spray-and-Wait with Fusion (BSWF). Different from previous work assuming that all packets are propagated independently, we consider that packets are spatial-temporal correlated in the forwarding process, and derive the dissemination law of correlated packets. Both the theoretic analysis and simulation results show that our cooperative forwarding schemes can achieve better tradeoff between delivery delay and transmission overhead. We also evaluate our proposed framework and schemes with real mobile traces. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the cooperative sensing scheme can reduce the number of samplings by 93 percent compared with the non-cooperative scheme; ERF can reduce the transmission overhead by 78 percent compared with Epidemic Routing (ER); BSWF can increase the delivery ratio by 16 percent, and reduce the delivery delay and transmission overhead by 5 and 32 percent respectively, compared with Binary Spray-and-Wait (BSW).","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308178","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7010070/06748096.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2308178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7010070","startPage":"392","endPage":"402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"COUPON: A Cooperative Framework for Building Sensing Maps in Mobile Opportunistic Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"COUPON: A Cooperative Framework for Building Sensing Maps in Mobile Opportunistic Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748096/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14863867","dateOfInsertion":"14 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6748096/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"COUPON: A Cooperative Framework for Building Sensing Maps in Mobile Opportunistic Networks","sourcePdf":"tpds-ma-2308178-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103212S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7010070","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"7010070","articleId":"6748096","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748099,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng-Guang Wu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology, Institute of Cyber-Systems and Control, Zhejiang University, Yuquan Campus, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6960135/6748099/wu-2306202-small.gif","p":["Zheng-Guang Wu was born in 1982.

Based on the derived conditions, the design methods of the desired sampled-data three-layer fully connected feedforward neural-network-based controller are established to obtain the largest sampling interval and the smallest upper bound of the cost function. A practical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2306202","startPage":"2180","endPage":"2190","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6960135/06748099.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2306202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6960135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exponential Stabilization for Sampled-Data Neural-Network-Based Control Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cost function","Delays","Symmetric matrices","Upper bound","Closed loop systems","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","feedforward neural nets","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","optimal control","sampled data systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exponential stabilization","sampled-data neural-network-based control systems","sampled-data stabilization","optimal guaranteed cost","time-dependent Lyapunov functional approach","closed-loop systems","controller design methods","fully connected feedforward neural-network-based controller","sampling interval"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Exponentially stable","neural networks","nonlinear systems","sampled-data control."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Databases, Factual","Neural Networks (Computer)","Nonlinear Dynamics"]},{"kwd":["Exponentially stable","neural networks","nonlinear systems","sampled-data control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748099/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Exponential Stabilization for Sampled-Data Neural-Network-Based Control Systems","volume":"25","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6748099/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14759092","pubMedId":"25420241","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP140102180"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2011CB710706 and 2012CB215202"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B12018"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2012AA040305"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61174058, 60974052, 61134001, 61320106009, 61134007 and 61304072"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exponential Stabilization for Sampled-Data Neural-Network-Based Control Systems","sourcePdf":"tnnls-wu-2306202-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148551S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6960135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6960135","articleId":"6748099","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6748100,"authors":[{"name":"Gaurav Bhatnagar","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/6878502/6748100/bhatn-2303789-small.gif","p":["Gaurav Bhatnagar (M'10) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, India, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","From 2009, he was with the Computer Vision and Sensing Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, ON, Canada for four years, where he was a Postdoctoral Fellow.

For this purpose, a new advent in the definition of fractional Fourier transform, namely, dual parameter fractional Fourier transform (DP-FrFT) is proposed and used in multimedia encryption. The core idea behind the proposed encryption technique is to obtain biometrically encoded bitstream followed by the generation of the keys used in the encryption process. Since the key generation process of encryption technique directly determines the security of the technique. Therefore, this paper proposes an efficient method for generating biometrically encoded bitstream from biometrics and its usage to generate the keys. Then, the encryption of multimedia data is done in the DP-FrFT domain with the help of Hessenberg decomposition and nonlinear chaotic map. Finally, a reliable decryption process is proposed to construct original multimedia data from the encrypted data. Theoretical analyses and computer simulations both confirm high security and efficiency of the proposed encryption technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biometric Inspired Multimedia Encryption Based on Dual Parameter Fractional Fourier Transform","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2014.2303789","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/6878502/06748100.pdf","startPage":"1234","endPage":"1247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2014.2303789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6878502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748100/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Biometric Inspired Multimedia Encryption Based on Dual Parameter Fractional Fourier Transform","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6748100/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14516723","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Canada Research Chair Program"},{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Discovery Grant"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biometric Inspired Multimedia Encryption Based on Dual Parameter Fractional Fourier Transform","sourcePdf":"tsmc-bhatnagar-2303789-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092801S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"6878502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6878502","articleId":"6748100","onlineDate":"25 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748105,"authors":[{"name":"Anas Mazady","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6776447/6748105/6748105-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anas Mazady received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC, USA, in 2010.

The corona discharge of high voltage transmission lines, results in power loss, radio interference and audible noise, which become more serious at the high altitudes. Besides, it has a great influence on the safe and robust operation of high voltage apparatus. A study carried out in the chamber made of perspex, was that AC corona characteristics varied with air pressure and humidity through the rod plane electrodes. The experiments showed that the inception voltage of AC corona was reduced with air pressure decreasing or humidity increasing. Meanwhile, the amplitude - phase distribution of AC corona pulse was displayed under different air pressure and humidity. Under low humidity (RH=25% or 55%), the streamer pulses only appear in the rise edge of positive half cycle, and the number of streamer pulses is few. The negative streamer pulses occur around the peak value of the negative half cycle. The streamer pulses appear in the rise and fall edge of positive half cycle at the same time with high humidity (RH=85%), and the number of streamer pulses increases obviously. When the humidity is higher (RH=95%), the streamer pulses appear only in the fall edge of positive half cycle. Furthermore, the negative streamer pulses around the peak of the negative half cycle also disappear.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Corona","Humidity","Voltage measurement","Electrodes","Discharges (electric)","Space charge","Electric fields"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["corona","discharges (electric)","power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude-phase distribution","streamer pulses","inception voltage","rod plane electrodes","humidity","air pressure","AC corona characteristics","perspex","high voltage apparatus","audible noise","radio interference","power loss","high voltage transmission lines","corona discharge","corona problem","AC corona pulse"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC corona","inception voltage","corona pulse amplitude","air pressure","humidity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CEIDP.2013.6748131","publicationTitle":"2013 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena","pdfPath":"/iel7/6733444/6747062/06748131.pdf","startPage":"838","endPage":"841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEIDP.2013.6748131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of pressure and humidity on the amplitude \u2014 Phase distribution of AC corona pulse","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Influence of pressure and humidity on the amplitude \u2014 Phase distribution of AC corona pulse","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748131/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748131/","accessionNumber":"14128696","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of pressure and humidity on the amplitude \u2014 Phase distribution of AC corona pulse","confLoc":"Chenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"7A7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057669S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6733444","isNumber":"6747062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6733444","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6747062","articleId":"6748131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6748314,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Cui","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Cui","id":"37085508290"},{"name":"Chandima Ekanayake","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia"],"firstName":"Chandima","lastName":"Ekanayake","id":"37403460100"},{"name":"Tapan K.

This paper uses the finite element method (FEM) to analysis the influence of electric field distribution on the dielectric response of transformer oil-paper insulation system. Firstly a simple transformer winding insulation model consisting of several layers of pressboard and oil ducts is established in FEM. Here, two circumstances are taken into consideration to represent normal insulation and insulation with cracks penetrating all the layers. The complex capacitance (real part and imaginary part) is calculated to obtain general tendency of dielectric response of winding insulation in a transformer. Secondly, this paper proposes FEM model of a three phase oil-immersed power transformer insulation system. Based on the developed model, the dependency between electric field displacement, current density at the selected point with the applied electric field is discussed in detail. Moreover, the complex capacitance of transformer insulation is also studied. This will help to understand the correlations among insulation defects, electric field variations, and dielectric response of insulation.","doi":"10.1109/CEIDP.2013.6748314","publicationTitle":"2013 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Annual Report Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena","pdfPath":"/iel7/6733444/6747062/06748314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CEIDP.2013.6748314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747062","startPage":"39","endPage":"42","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite element method modeled dielectric response for condition evaluation of transformer insulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite element method modeled dielectric response for condition evaluation of transformer insulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748314/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14128544","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6748314/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite element method modeled dielectric response for condition evaluation of transformer insulation","confLoc":"Chenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"2A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080768S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6733444","isNumber":"6747062","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6733444","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6747062","articleId":"6748314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6748465,"authors":[{"name":"Jiakai Chen","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Jiakai","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086742816"},{"name":"Yan He","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"He","id":"37288328000"},{"name":"Wei Wei","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wei","id":"37399956000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6343-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6341-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6748465","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Terminology","Sociology","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","railway communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aperiodic message transmission","multiple vehicle bus","MVB","particle swarm optimization","PSO","event polling","train operation safety","optimization model","IEC 61375"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple Vehicle Bus","Particle Swarm Optimization","Event Arbitration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748465","abstract":"There are two different types of messages transmitted on Multiple Vehicle Bus (MVB): periodic messages and aperiodic messages, and the aperiodic messages are sporadically transmitted based on event polling.

The result shows that compared with method recommended in IEC-61375, the proposed method could reduce the collisions considerably.","doi":"10.1109/ICACI.2013.6748465","pdfPath":"/iel7/6739901/6748463/06748465.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"11","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Sixth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","publicationTitle":"2013 Sixth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACI.2013.6748465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The optimization of aperiodic message transmission on MVB based on Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748465/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"The optimization of aperiodic message transmission on MVB based on Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14130744","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6748465/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The optimization of aperiodic message transmission on MVB based on Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047215S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6739901","isNumber":"6748463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6739901","xplore-issue":"6748463","articleId":"6748465","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6748478,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyang Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Zhuhai College of Jilin University, Zhuhai, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyang","lastName":"Fu","id":"38247200100"},{"name":"Shuqing Zhang","affiliation":["Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Shuqing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37535976700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6343-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6341-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6748478","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Classification algorithms","Iris","Diabetes","Benchmark testing","Nonhomogeneous media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","genetic algorithms","gradient methods","multilayer perceptrons","pattern classification","string matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern classification","evolving neural network ensembles classifier","ENNE classifier","variable string genetic algorithm","regularized negative correlation learning algorithm","RNCL algorithm","VGA algorithm","regularization parameter","gradient descent","backpropagation algorithm multilayer perception classifier","BP-MLP classifier","RNCLgd hybrid algorithm","classification performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748478","abstract":"In this paper, an evolving neural network ensembles (ENNE) classifier using variable string genetic algorithm (VGA) is proposed.

The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) can utilize OED to improve the searching ability. However, the main effect of OED holds only when no or weak interaction of factors exists. This limitation of OED makes PSO search effective on unimodal or simple problems but very vulnerable on complex multimodal problems. This paper presents an effective method utilizing OED on multimodal problems. A new vector is formed through learning particle's previous and neighborhood's best vector. Instead of treating the new vector as exemplar for others to follow, this new vector is treated as base vector which needs to be explored further. Experimental studies on a set of test functions show that OED method used in this way has better robustness and converges closer to the global optimum than several other peer algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICACI.2013.6748498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACI.2013.6748498","publicationTitle":"2013 Sixth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Sixth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6739901/6748463/06748498.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal Experimental Design method used in Particle Swarm Optimization for multimodal problems","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14130770","htmlLink":"/document/6748498/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal Experimental Design method used in Particle Swarm Optimization for multimodal problems","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"89.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091955S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6739901","isNumber":"6748463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6739901","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6748463","articleId":"6748498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6748503,"authors":[{"name":"Yujie Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Soochow University, Suzhou, P.

First, a generalized model for CDMA-based watermarking with informed embedding is described, taking into account more detailed host information and possible pre-processing operations on the watermark at both the embedder and the extractor. Then, as special cases of this model, several typical embedding methods are analyzed, including an informed embedding method with selective host rejection which exhibits better robustness for high-payload watermarking. Moreover, an audio watermarking scheme is designed to verify the proposed method. Experimental results show that this scheme can achieve a high payload of up to more than 200 bps (bit per second) while preserving the audio fidelity and the robustness against common signal processing and attacks. Therefore, the proposed model and embedding method provide a general and effective approach to improve the performance of CDMA-based watermarking systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICACI.2013.6748506","publicationTitle":"2013 Sixth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Sixth International Conference on Advanced Computational Intelligence (ICACI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6739901/6748463/06748506.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACI.2013.6748506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Informed embedding with selective host rejection for CDMA-based high-payload and robust watermarking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748506/","displayDocTitle":"Informed embedding with selective host rejection for CDMA-based high-payload and robust watermarking","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14130772","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748506/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Informed embedding with selective host rejection for CDMA-based high-payload and robust watermarking","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06752S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6739901","isNumber":"6748463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6739901","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6748463","articleId":"6748506","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6748509,"authors":[{"name":"Na Du","affiliation":["Computer & Information Engineering College, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Na","lastName":"Du","id":"37086729863"},{"name":"Pinbiao Gu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Pinbiao","lastName":"Gu","id":"37883764300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6343-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6341-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6748509","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Reliability","Polynomials","Encoding","Synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","OFDM modulation","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","LDPC codes","low density parity check code","DM-OFDM system","differential modulation OFDM system","low decoding complexity"]}],"abstract":"Low density parity check code (LDPC) has constructed a flexible, low decoding complexity and performance close to Shannon limit benefits.

In real manufacturing environment, multi-objectives should be taken into consideration simultaneously during the machining process. Meanwhile, the processing time for each job is often imprecise in many real applications. Therefore, multi-objective integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) problem with fuzzy processing time is addressed in this paper. The processing time is described as triangular fuzzy number.

In this paper, in order to solve the problem of single training sample, sample extension method is adopted to expand fourteen virtual samples. And for the problem of changeable face pattern, like pose, expressions, illumination etc., this paper uses image blocking and applies weighted two-directional 2DPCA to extract the local feature information of face image. Further, fuse the local feature information of sub-image to face recognition.

We calculate the asymptotic sum rate of singular value decomposition (SVD)-based precoder and regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoder. The optimal number of served users is taken into account. The result shows that M should be more than the product of the number of users and the number of antennas at each user. Based on the optimal number, we propose a convenient data stream allocation strategy aiming to improve the system sum rate, meanwhile maintaining the number of simultaneously served users. Numerical simulations reveal that our approximations are appropriate for the large-scale MU-MIMO system and the proposed data stream allocation can provide significant improvement in sum-rate performance.","doi":"10.1049/cp.2013.2176","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Cyberspace Technology (CCT 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Cyberspace Technology (CCT 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745500/6748549/06748650.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp.2013.2176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748549","startPage":"567","endPage":"572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The massive MU-MIMO system with optimal number of users through linear precoders","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748650","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"The massive MU-MIMO system with optimal number of users through linear precoders","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-23 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748650/","conferenceDate":"23-23 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The massive MU-MIMO system with optimal number of users through linear precoders","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"20132176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027809S","chronDate":"23-23 Nov. 2013","isNumber":"6748549","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745500","citationCount":"1","articleId":"6748650","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6748709,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Mueller","affiliation":["NaMLab gGmbH"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Mueller","id":"38468660100"},{"name":"Ekaterina Yurchuk","affiliation":["NaMLab gGmbH"],"firstName":"Ekaterina","lastName":"Yurchuk","id":"37847143200"},{"name":"Stefan Slesazeck","affiliation":["NaMLab gGmbH"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Slesazeck","id":"37427502300"},{"name":"Thomas Mikolajick","affiliation":["NaMLab gGmbH"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Mikolajick","id":"37264991900"},{"name":"Johannes M\u00fcller","affiliation":["IHM TU Dresden Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Johannes","lastName":"M\u00fcller","id":"37290455200"},{"name":"Tom Herrmann","affiliation":["Fraunhofer IPMS/CNT Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Herrmann","id":"37394751300"},{"name":"Alban Zaka","affiliation":["GLOBALFOUNDRIES Dresden Module One LLC & Co.

To address this problem, a novel multi-antenna design approach is proposed herein to obtain efficient and uncorrelated antennas. By manipulating the chassis structure, more than one characteristic mode is enabled to resonate at frequencies below 1 GHz. With proper excitations for different characteristic modes, which are orthogonal to each other, well matched multi-antennas with low coupling and correlation are achieved. A chassis loaded with two T-shaped metal strips above its longer edges is taken as an example modification to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design approach at 900 MHz. This modification creates a new characteristic mode which resonates near 900 MHz. Afterward, two antenna feeds were designed to efficiently excite the chassis' fundamental dipole mode and the T-strip mode with very low correlation. The T-strip antenna covers LTE Band 8 (880-960 MHz), and the dipole mode antenna covers both LTE Band 5 (824-894 MHz) and LTE Band 8. The proposed dual-antenna design was found to outperform a reference design significantly, both with and without user interactions (i.e., one-hand and two-hand data grips). Practical aspects of mobile handset antennas are also investigated. The prototype was also fabricated and measured, and the measured results show reasonable agreements with the simulated results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6809233/06748862.pdf","startPage":"2756","endPage":"2766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2308530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2308530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Orthogonal MIMO Handset Antennas Based on Characteristic Mode Manipulation at Frequency Bands Below 1 GHz","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Dipole antennas","Resonant frequency","Mobile antennas","Couplings","Strips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dipole antennas","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","mobile antennas","mobile handsets","multifrequency antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal MIMO handset antennas","characteristic mode manipulation","multiantenna design","mutual coupling","chassis fundamental dipole mode","antenna element","T-shaped metal strips","T-strip mode","T-strip antenna covers LTE band 8","dipole mode antenna","LTE band 5","dual-antenna design","mobile handset antennas","frequency 880 MHz to 960 MHz","frequency 824 MHz to 894 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna array","mobile antenna","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems","mutual coupling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748862/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Design of Orthogonal MIMO Handset Antennas Based on Characteristic Mode Manipulation at Frequency Bands Below 1 GHz","volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6748862/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267564","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Orthogonal MIMO Handset Antennas Based on Characteristic Mode Manipulation at Frequency Bands Below 1 GHz","sourcePdf":"tap-li-2308530-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089147S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6809233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"6809233","articleId":"6748862","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748868,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Liu","affiliation":["IRISA/INRIA-Rennes, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6889059/6748868/liu-2308642-small.gif","p":["Zhi Liu (M\u201907) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, and the Ph.D. degree from Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 1999, 2002, and 2005, respectively.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China.

Then, superpixel-level temporal saliency is measured by integrating motion distinctiveness of superpixels with a scheme of temporal saliency prediction and adjustment, and superpixel-level spatial saliency is measured by evaluating global contrast and spatial sparsity of superpixels. Finally, a pixel-level saliency derivation method is used to generate pixel-level temporal and spatial saliency maps, and an adaptive fusion method is exploited to integrate them into the spatiotemporal saliency map. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms six state-of-the-art spatiotemporal saliency models in terms of both saliency detection and human fixation prediction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748868/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","volume":"24","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"14564494","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748868/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Superpixel-Based Spatiotemporal Saliency Detection","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61171144 and 61105001"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"11ZR1413000"},{"fundingName":"Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission","grantNumber":"12ZZ086"},{"fundingName":"Key (Key Grant) Project of Chinese Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"212053"},{"fundingName":"Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme","grantNumber":"299202"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superpixel-Based Spatiotemporal Saliency Detection","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-liu-2308642-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121337S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6889059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"6889059","articleId":"6748868","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6748871,"authors":[{"name":"Minyeong Yoo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, College of Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6809233/6748871/6748871-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minyeong Yoo received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea, in 2013, where he is currently pursuing the M.

A systematic approach to instrumentation amplifier (IA) design using CMOS transistors operating in weak inversion is shown to offer high energy and noise efficiency. Practical methodologies to obviate 1/f noise, counteract electrode offset drift, improve common-mode rejection ratio, and obtain subhertz high-pass cutoff are illustrated with a survey of the state-of-the-art IAs. Furthermore, fundamental principles and state-of-the-art technologies for electrode-tissue impedance measurement, photoplethysmography, functional near-infrared spectroscopy, and signal coding and quantization are reviewed, with additional guidelines for overall power management including wireless transmission. Examples are presented of practical dry-contact and noncontact cardiac, respiratory, muscle and brain monitoring systems, and their clinical applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Impedance","Noise","Sensors","Impedance measurement","Monitoring","Biomedical monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","biomedical electrodes","biomedical electronics","biomedical measurement","biomedical optical imaging","CMOS integrated circuits","electric impedance measurement","fibre optic sensors","patient monitoring","photoplethysmography","physiology","reviews"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power management","wireless transmission","quantization","signal coding","functional near-infrared spectroscopy","photoplethysmography","subhertz high-pass cutoff","common-mode rejection ratio","electrode offset drift","1/f noise","CMOS transistors","instrumentation amplifier design","systematic approach","optical biosignal sensing","electrode-tissue impedance measurement","biopotential acquisition","practical interface configurations","noninvasive monitoring systems","performance limiting factor","electrode/optrode-body interface","unobtrusive wearable applications","micropower-integrated circuit design","optrode interfaces","noninvasive physiological monitoring instrumentation","electrode interfaces","integrated circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biological signal sensing","biomedical electronics","body\u2013electrode interface","electrode contacts","electrode\u2013tissue impedance","functional near-infrared spectroscopy","health monitoring","instrumentation amplifier (IA)","optrode interface","photoplethysmography","sensor interface"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Electrical Equipment and Supplies","Electrodes","Humans","Monitoring, Physiologic","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748876","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2014.2308552","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/6800026/06748876.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2014.2308552","startPage":"1522","endPage":"1537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6800026","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated Circuits and Electrode Interfaces for Noninvasive Physiological Monitoring","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Integrated Circuits and Electrode Interfaces for Noninvasive Physiological Monitoring","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748876/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","volume":"61","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6748876/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14238934","pubMedId":"24759282","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated Circuits and Electrode Interfaces for Noninvasive Physiological Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tbme-cauwenberghs-2308552-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198642S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6800026","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"6800026","articleId":"6748876","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6748877,"authors":[{"name":"Laszlo Gyongyosi","affiliation":["Quantum Technologies Laboratory, Department of Telecommunications, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"bio":{"p":["Laszlo Gyongyosi received the M.Sc. degree with honors in computer science, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree with highest distinction in quantum information from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BUTE), in 2013.

The lack of a practical way to measure write amplification for SSDs motivates us to propose a novel measuring method called RB-Explorer at the SSD level rather than the NAND Flash level. The goal of RB-Explorer is two-fold: (1) to accurately measure the write amplification of SSDs to quantify SSD endurance and (2) to study the impacts of I/O techniques on write amplification of SSDs. RB-Explorer incorporates a Ready/Busy (R/B) signal of one of the NAND Flashes in an SSD in a proposed write amplification model for SSDs with four full-parallelism levels (i.e., the channel, chip, die, and plane levels). RBExplorer takes two steps toward measuring write amplification. First, RB-Explorer quantifies the number of page programs using the low R/B signal level, the duration of which varies with the different operation (i.e., read, program, and erase) in NAND Flash. Second, RB-Explorer measures data volume written to NAND Flashes by considering parallelisms at four levels. Data volume written to a die in a NAND Flash is obtained as a product of the number N\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n of programs and page size P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">a</sub>\n.

RB-Explorer is applied to analyzing write amplification ratios of SSDs to track SSD endurance. Furthermore, we implement a real-world SSD (i.e., SSD-v) and employ a fine-tuned SSD simulator (i.e., SSDsim) to validate the accuracy of RB-Explorer. Our experimental results show that RB-Explorer improves on the accuracy of SSDsim-the state-of-the-art SSD simulator-in most tested cases. We conduct a series of measurements using micro-benchmarks and I/O traces to demonstrate how RB-Explorer may be applied to investigate SSDs.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2014.2308207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2014.2308207","startPage":"1133","endPage":"1148","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel7/12/7056411/06748886.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7056411","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RB-Explorer: An Accurate and Practical Approach to Write Amplification Measurement for SSDs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"RB-Explorer: An Accurate and Practical Approach to Write Amplification Measurement for SSDs","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2015","volume":"64","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748886/","accessionNumber":"14982415","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748886/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RB-Explorer: An Accurate and Practical Approach to Write Amplification Measurement for SSDs","sourcePdf":"tc-sun-2308207-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098243S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7056411","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7056411","articleId":"6748886","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6748889,"authors":[{"name":"Luyu Zhao","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese Univ. of HK, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6809233/6748889/6748889-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luyu Zhao (S'09\u2013M'14) was born in Xi'an, China, in 1984.

A synthesis and design theory of a CRDN is presented. Based on the admittance parameters of a given antenna array, a set of required rational functions and, consequently, the coupling matrix for a second-order decoupling network is obtained analytically. To prove the concept, two prototypes using microstrip resonators are designed and experimentally studied. Measurement results have demonstrated that an isolation improvement of more than 10 dB can be achieved within more than 15% bandwidth in both examples. The benefits of using a CRDN for different levels of isolation in a MIMO terminal are investigated through experiments and simulations. The results have shown that, as compared to the existing decoupling scheme using a lumped element, the proposed CRDN scheme can significantly increase the radiation efficiency, reduce the correlation, improve the channel capacity, and above all enhance the throughput of a MIMO terminal. The technique is general and can be applied to both symmetric and asymmetric arrays.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Coupled Resonator Decoupling Network for Two-Element Compact Antenna Arrays in Mobile Terminals","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2308547","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6809233/06748889.pdf","startPage":"2767","endPage":"2776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2308547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748889","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748889/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Coupled Resonator Decoupling Network for Two-Element Compact Antenna Arrays in Mobile Terminals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6748889/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14280739","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Coupled Resonator Decoupling Network for Two-Element Compact Antenna Arrays in Mobile Terminals","sourcePdf":"tap-wu-2308547-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065727S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6809233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"6809233","articleId":"6748889","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748893,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Sigalov","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Sigalov","id":"37601414700"},{"name":"Tomer Michaeli","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel"],"firstName":"Tomer","lastName":"Michaeli","id":"37396821800"},{"name":"Yaakov Oshman","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Yaakov","lastName":"Oshman","id":"37274910000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"6748893","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748893","abstract":"A generalized state space representation of dynamical systems with random modes switching according to a white random process is presented.

Each feed is formed by a vertical isosceles trapezoidal patch and a horizontal isosceles triangular patch.

Two tapered baluns are utilized to excite the antenna to achieve high isolation between the ports and reduce the cross-polarization levels. In order to increase the antenna gain and reduce the backward radiation, a compact surface mounted cavity is integrated with the antenna.

This technique combines a neural network and a 3-D ray launching algorithm in order to compute wireless channel performance in indoor scenarios. An example of applying the method for studying indoor radio wave propagation is presented and the results are compared with a very high resolution fully 3-D ray launching simulation as the reference solution. The new method allows the use of a lower number of launched rays in the simulation scenario whereas intermediate points can be predicted using neural network. Therefore a high gain in terms of computational efficiency (approximately 80% saving in simulation time) is achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748900/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14267540","volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6748900/","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Ray Launching-Neural Network Approach for Radio Wave Propagation Analysis in Complex Indoor Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Ray Launching-Neural Network Approach for Radio Wave Propagation Analysis in Complex Indoor Environments","sourcePdf":"tap-falcone-2308518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082609S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6809233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6809233","articleId":"6748900","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":6748902,"authors":[{"name":"Naizhi Wang","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, School of Electronics and Information, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6809233/6748902/6748902-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Naizhi Wang received both the B.Sc. degree in communication engineering and the M.A.Sc. degree in electromagnetic field and microwave technique from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in electronic science and technology.","From 2011 to 2013, he was a Visiting Student at the University of Quebec, Outaouais (UQO), Gatineau, QC, Canada, and contributed in the design, integration, and testing of antennas for V band applications.

The beam-tilting approach described here uses the phenomenon based on phase change resulting from an EM wave entering a medium of different refractive index. The metamaterial H-shaped unit-cell structure is configured to provide a high refractive index which was used to implement beam tilting in a bow-tie antenna. The fabricated unit-cell was first characterized by measuring its S-parameters. Hence, a two dimensional array was constructed using the proposed unit-cell to create a region of high refractive index which was implemented in the vicinity bow-tie structure to realize beam-tilting. The simulation and experimental results show that the main beam of the antenna in the E-plane is tilted by 17 degrees with respect to the end-fire direction at 7.3, 7.5, and 7.7 GHz. Results also show unlike conventional beam-tilting antennas, no gain drop is observed when the beam is tilted; in fact there is a gain enhancement of 2.73 dB compared to the original bow-tie antenna at 7.5 GHz. The reflection-coeflicient of the antenna remains <; - 10 dB in the frequency range of operation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam Tilting Antenna Using Integrated Metamaterial Loading","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2308516","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6809233/06748903.pdf","startPage":"2874","endPage":"2879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2308516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748903/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Beam Tilting Antenna Using Integrated Metamaterial Loading","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6748903/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2014","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267527","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam Tilting Antenna Using Integrated Metamaterial Loading","sourcePdf":"tap-dadgarpour-2308516-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05013S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6809233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6809233","articleId":"6748903","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748907,"authors":[{"name":"Jarno Vanne","affiliation":["Department of Pervasive Computing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6889059/6748907/vanne-2308453-small.gif","p":["Jarno Vanne (M\u201902) received the M.Sc. degree in information technology and the Ph.D. degree in computing and electrical engineering from Tampere University of Technology (TUT), Tampere, Finland, in 2002 and 2011, respectively.","He is a Research Fellow with the Department of Pervasive Computing, TUT.

The main reason for HEVC complexity is inter prediction that accounts for 60%-70% of the whole encoding time. This paper analyzes the rate-distortion-complexity characteristics of the HEVC inter prediction as a function of different block partition structures and puts the analysis results into practice by developing optimized mode decision schemes for the HEVC encoder. The HEVC inter prediction involves three different partition modes: square motion partition, symmetric motion partition (SMP), and asymmetric motion partition (AMP) out of which the decision of SMPs and AMPs are optimized in this paper. The key optimization techniques behind the proposed schemes are: 1) a conditional evaluation of the SMP modes; 2) range limitations primarily in the SMP sizes and secondarily in the AMP sizes; and 3) a selection of the SMP and AMP ranges as a function of the quantization parameter. These three techniques can be seamlessly incorporated in the existing control structures of the HEVC reference encoder without limiting its potential parallelization, hardware acceleration, or speed-up with other existing encoder optimizations. Our experiments show that the proposed schemes are able to cut the average complexity of the HEVC reference encoder by 31%-51% at a cost of 0.2%-1.3% bit rate increase under the random access coding configuration. The respective values under the low-delay B coding configuration are 32%-50% and 0.3%-1.3%.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6889059","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2308453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/6889059/06748907.pdf","startPage":"1579","endPage":"1593","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2308453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Mode Decision Schemes for HEVC Inter Prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Mode Decision Schemes for HEVC Inter Prediction","volume":"24","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6748907/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14564495","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748907/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Celtic-Plus","grantNumber":"H2B2VS"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Mode Decision Schemes for HEVC Inter Prediction","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-vanne-2308453-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143434S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6889059","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"6889059","articleId":"6748907","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6748908,"authors":[{"name":"Lev Pazin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6809233/6748908/6748908-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lev Pazin received the M.Sc. degree in radiomechanics from the Institute of Fine Mechanics and Optics, Leningrad, U.S.S.R.

Motivated by emerging applications in smart grid and distributed sparse regression, this paper studies distributed optimization methods for solving general problems which have a coupled global cost function and have inequality constraints. We consider a network scenario where each agent has no global knowledge and can access only its local mapping and constraint functions. To solve this problem in a distributed manner, we propose a consensus-based distributed primal-dual perturbation (PDP) algorithm. In the algorithm, agents employ the average consensus technique to estimate the global cost and constraint functions via exchanging messages with neighbors, and meanwhile use a local primal-dual perturbed subgradient method to approach a global optimum. The proposed PDP method not only can handle smooth inequality constraints but also non-smooth constraints such as some sparsity promoting constraints arising in sparse optimization.

The new concept uses a fully addressable high resolution flexible OLED pixel array on a thin, mechanically compliant biocompatible plastic substrate to selectively stimulate and/or silence small groups of neurons on either the cortical surface or, alternatively, within the deep brain. Optical measurements from a 455 nm blue flexible OLED test structure demonstrated the ability to emit 1 mW/mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n of instantaneous light intensity using a 13 V, 20 Hz pulse, which meets the minimum reported intensity at ~ 450 nm to induce optical stimulation in genetically modified neural tissue. Biocompatibility was successfully demonstrated by the ability to grow human epithelial cells on the surface of a full TFT process flow plastic flexible display substrate. Additionally, a new active matrix array display architecture was designed to support pulsed mode OLED operation. These preliminary results demonstrate the initial viability of extending flexible plastic substrate OLED display technology to the development of large-area, high-resolution emissive active matrix arrays for chronic optogenetic applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748913/","volume":"10","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6748913/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14317624","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of Flexible OLED Display Technology for Electro-Optical Stimulation and/or Silencing of Neural Activity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Flexible OLED Display Technology for Electro-Optical Stimulation and/or Silencing of Neural Activity","sourcePdf":"jdt-smith-2308436-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073634S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9425","isNumber":"6810189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9425","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6810189","articleId":"6748913","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6748914,"authors":[{"name":"Iraklis Giannakis","affiliation":["Institute of Infrastructure and Environment, School of Engineering, The University of Edinburgh, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6809233/6748914/6748914-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Iraklis Giannakis received the B.Sc. degree in geology and the M.Sc. degree in geophysics from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

The only assumption that these two new methods make is that the first time derivative of the electric field is constant within each FDTD time interval.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Piecewise Linear Recursive Convolution Approach for Dispersive Media Using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2308549","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6809233/06748914.pdf","startPage":"2669","endPage":"2678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2308549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748914/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Piecewise Linear Recursive Convolution Approach for Dispersive Media Using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6748914/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267539","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Novel Piecewise Linear Recursive Convolution Approach for Dispersive Media Using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","sourcePdf":"tap-giannopoulos-2308549-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084991S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6809233","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6809233","articleId":"6748914","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748919,"authors":[{"name":"Sam Agneessens","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology (INTEC), Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6809233/6748919/6748919-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sam Agneessens (S'14) was born in Belgium, in 1986.

Leveraging oversampling and noise shaping, the proposed SRO-TDC achieves high resolution without the need for calibration. Ring oscillators are switched between two frequencies to achieve noise shaping of the quantization error in an open-loop manner. By decoupling the sampling clock and input carrier frequencies, SRO-TDC is capable of operating at high oversampling ratios (OSRs). This paper also discusses different noise sources and quantization/device noise tradeoffs in noise-shaping TDCs and presents techniques to characterize TDC linearity, range, and noise performance. Fabricated in 90 nm CMOS technology, the proposed TDC operates over a wide range of input carrier frequencies (0.6-750 MHz) and sampling rates (50-750 MS/s). At 500 MS/s and 80 MHz carrier frequency, it achieves an integrated noise of 315 fs in a 1 MHz bandwidth while consuming 1.5 mW from a 1 V supply.

Electromagnetic noise by static eccentricity occurs in the course of manufacturing. The increase in errors is attributed to manufacturing errors of the components: the assembly and the torsional errors caused by shrink fitting.

Accordingly, in this paper, the acoustic noise using the electromagnetic excitation force was analyzed according to the rotor eccentricity. Finite-element analysis was used to analyze the rotor eccentricity considering the electrical and mechanical characteristics.

The variable parameters, such as mutation and crossover rates, are self-controlled based on the information of successful individuals and the number of Pareto optimal solutions in current iteration. In mutation step, the proposed algorithm incorporates multi-guiders to obtain a uniformly distributed Pareto front; the advantages of DE are combined with the mechanisms of non-dominated ranking and crowding distance sorting. The proposed A-NRDE algorithm is applied to a multi-objective version of TEAM 22 and five benchmark problems. Experimental results show that the proposed our approach is able to obtain a good distribution of Pareto front and convergence in all cases. Compared with several other state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, it achieves not only comparable results in terms of convergence and diversity metrics, but also a considerable reduction of the computational effort.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2013.2282395","startPage":"709","endPage":"712","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6748920/06748941.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2013.2282395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Parameter Controlling Non-Dominated Ranking Differential Evolution for Multi-Objective Optimization of Electromagnetic Problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Optimization","Measurement","Sociology","Statistics","Algorithm design and analysis","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","electromagnetic devices","evolutionary computation","iterative methods","Pareto distribution","sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive parameter control","nondominated ranking differential evolution","A-NRDE","multiobjective optimization","electromagnetic problems","multiobjective optimal design","crossover rates","self-control","Pareto optimal solutions","current iteration","Pareto front","crowding distance sorting","multiobjective version","benchmark problems","evolutionary algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","differential evolution algorithm","multi-objective optimization","TEAM 22"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748941/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Parameter Controlling Non-Dominated Ranking Differential Evolution for Multi-Objective Optimization of Electromagnetic Problems","volume":"50","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6748941/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14128224","externalId":"7017504","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Parameter Controlling Non-Dominated Ranking Differential Evolution for Multi-Objective Optimization of Electromagnetic Problems","sourcePdf":"tmag-koh-2282395-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053187S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6748920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6748920","articleId":"6748941","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":6748946,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Di Barba","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Information Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Di Barba","id":"37326509700"},{"name":"Ivo Dolezel","affiliation":["Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Institute of Thermomechanics, Praha, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Ivo","lastName":"Dolezel","id":"37547890000"},{"name":"Maria Evelina Mognaschi","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Information Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Maria Evelina","lastName":"Mognaschi","id":"37974630800"},{"name":"Antonio Savini","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Information Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Savini","id":"37297823000"},{"name":"Pavel Karban","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of West Bohemia, Plzen, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Karban","id":"37547892400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6748946","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":406},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748946","abstract":"The design optimization of an induction heating device is considered.

Due to the multiscale and multispectral features of the technology, MSOT comes with distinct requirements in implementation and data analysis. In this work, we investigate the interplay between scale, which depends on ultrasonic detection frequency, and optical multispectral spectral analysis, two dimensions that are unique to MSOT and represent a previously unexplored challenge. We show that ultrasound frequency-dependent artifacts suppress multispectral features and complicate spectral analysis. In response, we employ a wavelet decomposition to perform spectral unmixing on a per-scale basis (or per ultrasound frequency band) and showcase imaging of fine-scale features otherwise hidden by low frequency components. We explain the proposed algorithm by means of simple simulations and demonstrate improved performance in imaging data of blood vessels in human subjects.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2014.2308578","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/6803900/06748955.pdf","startPage":"1194","endPage":"1202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2014.2308578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiscale Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography by a Stationary Wavelet Transform Prior to Unmixing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748955/","displayDocTitle":"Multiscale Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography by a Stationary Wavelet Transform Prior to Unmixing","volume":"33","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14251312","pubMedId":"24770922","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748955/","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscale Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography by a Stationary Wavelet Transform Prior to Unmixing","sourcePdf":"tmi-taruttis-2308578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096379S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6803900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6803900","articleId":"6748955","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748956,"authors":[{"name":"John P.

They are also used in both brain computer and brain machine interface systems with assistance, rehabilitative, and entertainment applications. Despite the broad interest in clinical applications, the use of brain signals has been only recently investigated by the scientific community as a biometric characteristic to be used in automatic people recognition systems. However, brain signals present some peculiarities, not shared by the most commonly used biometrics, such as face, iris, and fingerprints, with reference to privacy compliance, robustness against spoofing attacks, possibility to perform continuous identification, intrinsic liveness detection, and universality. These peculiarities make the use of brain signals appealing. On the other hand, there are many challenges which need to be properly addressed. The understanding of the level of uniqueness and permanence of brain responses, the design of elicitation protocols, and the invasiveness of the acquisition process are only few of the challenges which need to be tackled. In this paper, we further speculate on those issues, which represent an obstacle toward the deployment of biometric systems based on the analysis of brain activity in real life applications and intend to provide a critical and comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods for electroencephalogram-based automatic user recognition, also reporting neurophysiological evidences related to the performed claims.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/6776454/06748964.pdf","startPage":"782","endPage":"800","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2014.2308640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2014.2308640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Brain waves for automatic biometric-based user recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Protocols","Electrodes","Brain","Scalp","Visualization","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","brain-computer interfaces","data privacy","electroencephalography","neurophysiology","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain waves","automatic biometric-based user recognition","brain diseases","brain computer interface system","brain machine interface system","assistance applications","entertainment application","rehabilitative application","clinical applications","brain signal","biometric characteristic","privacy compliance","spoofing attacks","continuous identification","intrinsic liveness detection","peculiarity","brain response","elicitation protocol","invasiveness","acquisition process","biometric system deployment","brain activity analysis","electroencephalogram-based automatic user recognition","neurophysiological evidence","EEG"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EEG","biometrics","brain rhythms","elicitation protocols"]},{"kwd":["EEG","biometrics","brain rhythms","elicitation protocols"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Brain waves for automatic biometric-based user recognition","volume":"9","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6748964/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14219358","dateOfInsertion":"10 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Brain waves for automatic biometric-based user recognition","sourcePdf":"tifs-campisi-2308640-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137651S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6776454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"6776454","articleId":"6748964","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6748969,"authors":[{"name":"Renquan Lu","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Control, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6924821/6748969/lu-2305443-small.gif","p":["Renquan Lu (M'08) received the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004.","He is currently a Full Professor with the Institute of Information and Control, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou.

Some synchronization criteria are established for reaching pinning control on networks of networks. Furthermore, the pinning scheme is designed, which shows that the nodes with very low degrees and large degrees are good candidates for applying pinning controllers.

We also allow the request arrival process to switch between normal and flash crowd modes to model user requests to a CCMN. We quantify the trade-offs in flash crowd detection delay and false alarm frequency, request allocation rates, and service capacities at the VMs. We show that under each request arrival mode (normal or flash crowd), the optimal redirection policy can be found in terms of a price for each VM, which is a function of the VM's service cost, with requests redirected to VMs in order of nondecreasing prices, and no redirection to VMs with prices above a threshold price. Applying our proposed strategy to a YouTube request trace data set shows that our strategy outperforms various benchmark strategies. We also present simulation results when various arrival traffic characteristics are varied, which again suggest that our proposed strategy performs well under these conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/6856249/06748976.pdf","startPage":"1434","endPage":"1445","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2014.2308726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2014.2308726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6856249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748976","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Request Redirection and Elastic Service Scaling in Cloud-Centric Media Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Switches","Servers","Computational modeling","Silicon","Cost function","Ash"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic request redirection","elastic service scaling","cloud-centric media networks","user request redirecting","CCMN","virtual machines","VMs","service capacity","cost function minimization","service response times","computing costs","routing costs","request arrival process","normal crowd mode","flash crowd mode","flash crowd detection delay","request allocation rates","service capacities","request arrival mode","optimal redirection policy","VM service cost","YouTube request trace data set","arrival traffic characteristics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud-centric content network","cost-aware provisioning","quickest detection","resource allocation","service capacity scaling","user request redirection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748976/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Request Redirection and Elastic Service Scaling in Cloud-Centric Media Networks","volume":"16","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6748976/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14450810","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Request Redirection and Elastic Service Scaling in Cloud-Centric Media Networks","sourcePdf":"tmm-tang-2308726-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130995S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6856249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6856249","articleId":"6748976","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748983,"authors":[{"name":"Arti M.K.","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Arti","lastName":"M.K.","id":"37085439634"},{"name":"Manav R.

A simple four-phase protocol is used for training and OSTBC data transmission. Decoding of OSTBC data at a user terminal is performed by replacing the exact CSI by the estimated CSI in a maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder. Tight approximations for the moment-generating function (MGF) of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at a user is derived under Rayleigh fading by ignoring the higher order noise terms. Analytical average error performance of the considered cooperative scheme is derived by using the MGF expression. Moreover, the analytical diversity order of the considered scheme is also obtained for certain system configurations. It is shown by simulations and analysis that the channel estimation does not affect the diversity order of the OSTBC-based two-way AF MIMO relay system.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2308638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6923505/06748983.pdf","startPage":"4118","endPage":"4124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2308638","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Two-Way AF MIMO Relaying of OSTBCs With Imperfect Channel Gains","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748983","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748983/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Two-Way AF MIMO Relaying of OSTBCs With Imperfect Channel Gains","volume":"63","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665051","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6748983/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Two-Way AF MIMO Relaying of OSTBCs With Imperfect Channel Gains","sourcePdf":"tvt-bhatnagar-2308638-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077751S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6923505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6923505","articleId":"6748983","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6748988,"authors":[{"name":"David Esseni","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica, Gestionale e Meccanica, Universit\u00e0 di Udine, Udine, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6963544/6748988/essen-2293135-small.gif","p":["David Esseni (S'98-M'00-SM'06-F'13) received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 1999.","He was a Visiting Scientist with the Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA, in 2000, and was a Fubright Research Scholar with the Notre Dame University, Notre Dame, IN, USA, in 2013.

However, while the active clamping circuit is conducting, extra current is injected into the gate of the IGBT, the gate voltage increases, and the IGBT operates in the active region. Therefore, long time conduction and frequent actions of the active clamping circuit will lead to extremely high switching loss of the IGBT with high collector-emitter voltage and serious switching loss imbalance between the series-connected IGBTs, which imperils the efficiency and safety of the system, particularly in the applications of high-voltage IGBT (HV-IGBT) series connection. In this paper, a novel active clamping circuit with status feedback is proposed for series-connected HV-IGBTs. A high-speed status feedback subcircuit is designed for transforming the operation status of an active clamping circuit into optical signal and feeding it back to the control system. According to the feedback signals, the microcontroller regulates the switching-on time and switching-off time of the series-connected HV-IGBTs' drive signals timely in order to implement voltage balancing and, thus, to restrain the actions of active clamping circuits. By applying this voltage balancing method to the HV-IGBT series connection circuit, the voltage balancing performance is expected to improve, and high switching loss and serious switching loss imbalance are expected to be suppressed. Experimental results verify the validity and superiorities of the proposed voltage balancing circuit and control strategy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry

During the MF process, the non-negativity, which ensures good representativeness of the learnt model, is critically important. However, current non-negative MF (NMF) models are mostly designed for problems in computer vision, while CF problems differ from them due to their extreme sparsity of the target rating-matrix. Currently available NMF-based CF models are based on matrix manipulation and lack practicability for industrial use. In this work, we focus on developing an NMF-based CF model with a single-element-based approach. The idea is to investigate the non-negative update process depending on each involved feature rather than on the whole feature matrices. With the non-negative single-element-based update rules, we subsequently integrate the Tikhonov regularizing terms, and propose the regularized single-element-based NMF (RSNMF) model. RSNMF is especially suitable for solving CF problems subject to the constraint of non-negativity. The experiments on large industrial datasets show high accuracy and low-computational complexity achieved by RSNMF.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6748996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267598","htmlLink":"/document/6748996/","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Non-Negative Matrix-Factorization-Based Approach to Collaborative Filtering for Recommender Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Non-Negative Matrix-Factorization-Based Approach to Collaborative Filtering for Recommender Systems","sourcePdf":"tii-luo-2308433-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087424S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6809862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"268","xplore-issue":"6809862","articleId":"6748996","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":6748997,"authors":[{"name":"Azadeh Alsadat Emrani Zarandi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Tehran Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Azadeh Alsadat Emrani","lastName":"Zarandi","id":"38474125700"},{"name":"Amir Sabbagh Molahosseini","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kerman Branch, Islamic Azad University, Kerman, Iran"],"firstName":"Amir Sabbagh","lastName":"Molahosseini","id":"37391659700"},{"name":"Mehdi Hosseinzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Tehran Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Hosseinzadeh","id":"37400348100"},{"name":"Saeid Sorouri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Kerman Branch, Islamic Azad University, Kerman, Iran"],"firstName":"Saeid","lastName":"Sorouri","id":"38474159300"},{"name":"Samuel Ant\u00e3o","affiliation":["Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores (INESC-ID), and Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST), Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Ant\u00e3o","id":"37545834500"},{"name":"Leonel Sousa","affiliation":["Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores (INESC-ID), and Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST), Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Leonel","lastName":"Sousa","id":"37265872100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"6748997","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1436},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6748997","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Delays","Very large scale integration","Power demand","Computer architecture","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","convertors","power consumption","residue number systems","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","delay reduction","power consumption","tradeoff","residue number system reverse converter","parallel-prefix adder","high-speed reverse converter design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital arithmetic","parallel-prefix adder","residue number system (RNS)","reverse converter."]},{"kwd":["Digital arithmetic","parallel-prefix adder","residue number system (RNS)","reverse converter"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, the implementation of residue number system reverse converters based on well-known regular and modular parallel-prefix adders is analyzed.

The objective is twofold: 1) to provide high accuracy in the area where an event is detected and 2) to ensure a long network lifetime. The complexity of the problem arises from the fact that these two properties are usually in conflict. To increase the synchronization accuracy, nodes are required to exchange synchronization packets at higher rate, thus impacting the network lifetime. Vice versa to ensure a long network life time, the number of packets to be exchanged should be minimized thus impacting the synchronization accuracy. A tradeoff can be achieved by observing that the packet rate should be increased only for the portion of the network surrounding the detected events as only these nodes require a higher accuracy to collect data. The proposed algorithm represents a formalization of this idea. Numerical and experimental results are provided to fvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6873368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2014.2304867","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2014.2304867","startPage":"2279","endPage":"2287","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/6873368/06749000.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749000/","displayDocTitle":"Clock Synchronization in Wireless Sensor Network With Selective Convergence Rate for Event Driven Measurement Applications","volume":"63","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"14513277","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"07 August 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6749000/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Italian Grant RIDITT through the Project DI.TR.IM.MIS Diffusione e Trasferimento di Tecnologie ad Imprese nel Settore delle Misure"},{"fundingName":"Italian Ministry of Economic Development"},{"fundingName":"Italian Grant FIRB Futuro in Ricerca through the Project NECTAR code RBFR08QWUV"},{"fundingName":"European Union Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007-2013]","grantNumber":"257462"},{"fundingName":"HYCON2 Network of Excellence"},{"fundingName":"PRIN08 robust synchronization technique for critical interference conditions in wireless network and stand alone measurement instruments"},{"fundingName":"Borsa di Ricerca all'estero di Giovani soci del Electric, and Electronic Measurement Group (GMEE)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clock Synchronization in Wireless Sensor Network With Selective Convergence Rate for Event Driven Measurement Applications","sourcePdf":"tim-lamonaca-2304867-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083905S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6873368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6873368","articleId":"6749000","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":6749002,"authors":[{"name":"Takahiro Nozaki","affiliation":["Ohnishi Laboratory, Department of System Design Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6749002/nozak-2308162-small.gif","p":["\nTakahiro Nozaki (S'11\u2013M'13) received the B.E. degree in system\ndesign engineering and the M.E. degree in integrated design engineering from Keio University, Yokohama, Japan, in 2010\nand 2012, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include motion control, haptics, robotics, and surgical robots.","Mr. Nozaki is also a Research Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."]},"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Nozaki","id":"37710319000"},{"name":"Takahiro Mizoguchi","affiliation":["Ohnishi Laboratory, Department of System Design Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6749002/mizog-2308162-small.gif","p":["\nTakahiro Mizoguchi (S'11) received the B.E. degree in system design\nengineering and the M.E. degree in integrated design engineering from Keio University, Yokohama, Japan, in 2010 and\n2012, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include motion control and haptics.","Mr. Mizoguchi is also a Research Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science."]},"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Mizoguchi","id":"37719448600"},{"name":"Kouhei Ohnishi","affiliation":["Ohnishi Laboratory, Department of System Design Engineering, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6827271/6749002/ohnis-2308162-small.gif","p":["\nKouhei Ohnishi (S'78\u2013M'80\u2013SM'00\u2013F'01) received the\nB.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1975, 1977, and\n1980, respectively.","Since 1980, he has been with Keio University, Yokohama, Japan.

The proposed method is validated through simulations as well as experiments with robotic and human operators. The obtained results clearly reveal the features of human motions, although it is difficult to recognize the differences from the original responses.

This allows to treat indifferently the caseg in which the samples come from a random external source and the one in which the input space can be freely explored. Both consistency of the ERM procedure and approximating capabilities of the estimator are analyzed, proving conditions to ensure convergence. Since the theoretical analysis shows that the estimation improves as the discrepancy of the observation points becomes smaller, low-discrepancy sequences, a family of sampling methods commonly employed for efficient numerical integration, are also analyzed.

Such a unique scheme can substantially enhance computational efficiency during optimization process.

The sensitivity-based method, which can cope with some constraint conditions, is suitable for large-scale three-dimensional TO. However, if the material density is defined by unknown variables in TO, elements with intermediate density (grayscale) occasionally appear. The grayscale cannot clearly show the material allocation within its finite element. Thus, we propose a sigmoid-based filtering function to suppress the generation of grayscale. Moreover, because the constraint condition can be simply taken into consideration, sequential linear programming is occasionally utilized as a topology optimizer. However, the convergence characteristics frequently oscillate and are strongly dependent on the move limit that controls the maximum intensity of the correction vector. To overcome this numerical difficulty, we propose an identification technique for the determination of a quasi-optimal move limit (QOML).

Modeling each laminate individually by the finite element method requires many elements and leads to large systems of equations. Homogenization represents a promising method to overcome this problem. A two-scale finite element method is proposed to efficiently compute the eddy current losses in laminated media with nonlinear material properties. A rather coarse finite element grid suffices to approximate the losses accurately. The method based on the magnetic vector potential is described. The laminates are basically considered individually in the finite element assembly taking account of the nonlinearity. This is computationally very intensive. Some adapted integration rules are introduced and studied to accelerate the finite element assembly. The accuracy and the computational costs of the proposed method are shown by a numerical example.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Scale Homogenization of the Nonlinear Eddy Current Problem With FEM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2013.2282334","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6748920/06749045.pdf","startPage":"413","endPage":"416","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2013.2282334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748920","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749045/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Two-Scale Homogenization of the Nonlinear Eddy Current Problem With FEM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"50","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6749045/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","externalId":"7010104","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14128113","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Scale Homogenization of the Nonlinear Eddy Current Problem With FEM","sourcePdf":"tmag-hollaus-2282334-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049337S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6748920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6748920","articleId":"6749045","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6749068,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Lei","affiliation":["University of Technology, School of Electrical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Systems, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Lei","id":"37546091400"},{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37404292400"},{"name":"Jiefeng Hu","affiliation":["University of Technology, School of Electrical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Systems, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Jiefeng","lastName":"Hu","id":"37856167500"},{"name":"Jianguo Zhu","affiliation":["University of Technology, School of Electrical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Systems, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Jianguo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37279939600"},{"name":"Youguang Guo","affiliation":["University of Technology, School of Electrical, Mechanical and Mechatronic Systems, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Youguang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37277882800"},{"name":"Keran Shao","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Keran","lastName":"Shao","id":"37266409700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6749068","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":817},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"abstract":"In our previous research, flux-switching permanent magnet machine (FSPMM) was investigated for the application in hybrid electric vehicles.

To achieve this, the universal Kriging method is combined with a new-type local window, called the hypersphere, and the truncated Gaussian sampling. At the center of a nominal design point, accurate surrogate models for performance functions of interest are generated in a relatively small hyperspherical local window. The first-order design sensitivity values are extracted from Jacobian matrices of the locally approximated models. Such optimization scheme considerably reduces sampling points and iterative designs, and also facilitates deriving the design sensitivity with high precision. The proposed method is tested with two design models having more than 10 design variables. Its efficiency and accuracy is thoroughly investigated by comparing it with existing methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6749077/","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14128020","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"2","externalId":"7015804","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design Optimization of a Loudspeaker Utilizing Sampling-Based Sensitivity Information of a Hyperspherical Local Window","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Optimization of a Loudspeaker Utilizing Sampling-Based Sensitivity Information of a Hyperspherical Local Window","sourcePdf":"tmag-kim-2282309-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047814S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6748920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","xplore-issue":"6748920","articleId":"6749077","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6749083,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Zhuansun","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, State Key Lab of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, School of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Zhuansun","id":"38234947600"},{"name":"Xikui Ma","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, State Key Lab of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, School of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xikui","lastName":"Ma","id":"37279528000"},{"name":"Qi Liu","affiliation":["Xi'an Jiaotong University, State Key Lab of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, School of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086619651"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6749083","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Equations","Media","Memory management","Algorithm design and analysis","Photonic band gap"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","nonlinear optics","optical materials","photonic band gap"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["exponential time differencing algorithm","FDTD-PML analysis","nonlinear photonic bandgap structures","ETD algorithm","third-order nonlinear materials","Z-transform method","auxiliary differential equation method","perfectly matched layer","complex frequency shifted variable","memory requirement","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boundary conditions","finite difference methods","nonlinear optics"]}],"abstract":"An exponential time differencing (ETD) algorithm is presented for the analysis of photonic crystal structures comprising the third-order nonlinear materials.

Numerical verification involving comparisons with closed-form solutions and the results of other schemes, exhibits the high accuracy of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2013.2282332","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6748920/06749110.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2013.2282332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748920","startPage":"161","endPage":"164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consistent Study of Graphene Structures Through the Direct Incorporation of Surface Conductivity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Consistent Study of Graphene Structures Through the Direct Incorporation of Surface Conductivity","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","isJournal":true,"externalId":"7003804","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14128040","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6749110/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consistent Study of Graphene Structures Through the Direct Incorporation of Surface Conductivity","sourcePdf":"tmag-kantartzis-2282332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065462S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6748920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6748920","articleId":"6749110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6749116,"authors":[{"name":"Youpeng Huangfu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Youpeng","lastName":"Huangfu","id":"37085404930"},{"name":"Shuhong Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shuhong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280458300"},{"name":"Jie Qiu","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37272635900"},{"name":"Haijun Zhang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Haijun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085506659"},{"name":"Guolin Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Guolin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085452906"},{"name":"Jianguo Zhu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Jianguo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37279939600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6749116","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":914},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Equations","Torque","Vectors","Induction motors","Transient analysis","Finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","induction motors","Laplace equations","torque","transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient performance analysis","field-circuit coupled finite-element method","induction motor","sinusoidal voltage excitation","numerical analysis","nonlinear time-stepping finite-element equations","mechanical motion equations","circuit equations","Laplace equation","electromagnetic torque","single-phase IM","three-phase IM","field-circuit coupled code","FE package","FLUX 2-D"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field-circuit coupled","FEM","induction motor (IM)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the application of field-circuit coupled finite-element method for predicting the performance of induction motor (IM) under a sinusoidal voltage excitation is described.

The main difficulty in time-domain modeling of a Cole-Cole medium is that the polarization relation that describes its electromagnetic behavior is a differential equation of fractional order. By definition, the fractional derivative of a function is a nonlocal operator and its computation at a time instant involves all previous function values. Thus, the memory demands of a typical FDTD scheme for Cole-Cole media would be high. However, by an appropriate approximation of the Gr\u00fcnwald-Letnikov definition of the fractional derivative, we can implement an FDTD scheme with reasonable memory demands. This is achieved by means of sums of decaying exponentials used to approximate the coefficients that appear in the Gr\u00fcnwald-Letnikov definition. As a result, the FDTD scheme requires the additional storage of a limited number of auxiliary vectors only. The proposed scheme has been applied successfully to the simulation of the excitation of Cole-Cole media by a wideband Gaussian electromagnetic pulse.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2013.2281998","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6748920/06749142.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2013.2281998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748920","startPage":"181","endPage":"184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximation of Gr\u00fcnwald\u2013Letnikov Fractional Derivative for FDTD Modeling of Cole\u2013Cole Media","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Approximation of Gr\u00fcnwald\u2013Letnikov Fractional Derivative for FDTD Modeling of Cole\u2013Cole Media","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749142/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","isJournal":true,"externalId":"7004304","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14128239","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6749142/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximation of Gr\u00fcnwald\u2013Letnikov Fractional Derivative for FDTD Modeling of Cole\u2013Cole Media","sourcePdf":"tmag-rekanos-2281998-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047498S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6748920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6748920","articleId":"6749142","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6749146,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos V.

The new methodology blends a compact stencil-optimized discretization process with general vector finite elements via the pertinent coupling conditions and divides the domain into tightly coupled blocks. A key asset is that both approaches are time advanced independently while their state-space models are derived via a Krylov-based scheme with scaled Laguerre functions, which drastically decreases the order of the transfer matrix. Therefore, complex geometries are consistently treated without the need of excessively fine grid tessellations. Numerical results from various nanocomposite devices validate the hybrid method and reveal its applicability.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6748920/06749146.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"176","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2013.2283220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2013.2283220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748920","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Analysis of Multiconductor Nanostructured Devices via a Compact Block FDTD/VFETD Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-domain analysis","Finite difference methods","Random access memory","Vectors","Nanoscale devices","Antennas","Couplings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carbon nanotubes","finite difference time-domain analysis","finite element analysis","matrix algebra","nanocomposites","reduced order systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiconductor nanostructured devices","compact block FDTD-VFETD method","reduced-order modeling","vector finite-element time-domain technique","multiconductor nanoscale structures","compact stencil-optimized discretization","finite elements","pertinent coupling conditions","coupled blocks","state-space models","Krylov-based scheme","Laguerre functions","transfer matrix","complex geometry","nanocomposite"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carbon nanotubes (CNTs)","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods","finite-element time-domain (FETD) schemes","model-order reduction","nanostructured devices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Analysis of Multiconductor Nanostructured Devices via a Compact Block FDTD/VFETD Method","volume":"50","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6749146/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14128264","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","externalId":"7004104","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Analysis of Multiconductor Nanostructured Devices via a Compact Block FDTD/VFETD Method","sourcePdf":"tmag-kantartzis-2283220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080134S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6748920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","xplore-issue":"6748920","articleId":"6749146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6749147,"authors":[{"name":"Istvan Bardi","affiliation":["ANSYS, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Istvan","lastName":"Bardi","id":"37300184200"},{"name":"Jefferson Tharp","affiliation":["ANSYS, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Jefferson","lastName":"Tharp","id":"37086635009"},{"name":"Rickard Petersson","affiliation":["ANSYS, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Rickard","lastName":"Petersson","id":"38242201600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6749147","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":458},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Impedance","Periodic structures","Slabs","Dielectrics","Optical ring resonators","Permeability","Finite element analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic fields","finite element analysis","slabs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FEM","finite-element method","homogeneous sheet isotropic-anisotropic impedance boundary condition","dielectric slab","unit cell","Homogenization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FEM","frequency selective surface (FSS)","homogenization","metamaterials","multiscale problems","periodic structures"]}],"abstract":"Homogenization is an efficient for simulating multiscale problems using the finite-element method.

A global two-level algorithm had been proposed to deal with the convergence problems, but the requirement to refine the global surrogate model in each step can demand high computational time. This paper introduces a global two-level genetic algorithm that uses single predefined coarse and fine surrogate models, which are defined as an artificial neural network nonlinear regression of a preliminary set of finite element simulations.

Furthermore, manufacturing cost and computation cost have been reduced a lot.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2013.2277598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2013.2277598","endPage":"720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6748920/06749183.pdf","startPage":"717","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Sequential Design Optimization of PM-SMC Motors for Six Sigma Quality Manufacturing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749183/","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Sequential Design Optimization of PM-SMC Motors for Six Sigma Quality Manufacturing","volume":"50","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"14128050","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6749183/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","externalId":"7017704","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Sequential Design Optimization of PM-SMC Motors for Six Sigma Quality Manufacturing","sourcePdf":"tmag-lei-2277598-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044355S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6748920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6748920","articleId":"6749183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6749193,"authors":[{"name":"Ki-Chan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanbat National University, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Ki-Chan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37292682000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6749193","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3412},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Forging","Rotors","Saturation magnetization","Permanent magnets","Permanent magnet motors","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","laminations","minimisation","permanent magnet motors","rotors","synchronous motors","torque motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interior permanent magnet synchronous motor","cogging torque","torque ripple","minimization","asymmetric barrier design","inverting lamination","finite element method","permanent magnet rotor","torque characteristics","torque distortion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymmetric barrier","cogging torque","interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM)","skew method","torque ripple"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Method for Minimization of Cogging Torque and Torque Ripple for Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749193","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2013.2285234","startPage":"793","endPage":"796","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6748920/06749193.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2013.2285234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748920","abstract":"This paper proposes a method to minimize the cogging torque and torque ripple of an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor by adopting asymmetric barrier design and inverting lamination method.

Conflicting objectives lead to the employment of optimization methods in the transformer design. Multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) consist of several competing and incommensurable objective functions. Recently, as a search and optimization technique inspired by nature, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been broadly applied to solve MOPs. Various EAs have been proposed for this purpose, and their usefulness has been demonstrated in several application domains of science and engineering. In this paper, we propose the unrestricted population-size evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm (UPS-EMOA) approach combined with chaotic sequences (CMOA). Our approach integrates the merits of both UPS-EMOA and chaotic sequences to improve the efficiency of the optimization procedure. Numerical results of transformer design optimization demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CMOA when compared with the UPS-EMOA approach to preserve the diversity of the solutions and find nondominated solutions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749206/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"externalId":"7016504","accessionNumber":"14128176","volume":"50","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6749206/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Optimization of Transformer Design Using a Chaotic Evolutionary Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Optimization of Transformer Design Using a Chaotic Evolutionary Approach","sourcePdf":"tmag-leite-2285704-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07989S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6748920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6748920","articleId":"6749206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6749213,"authors":[{"name":"Mauricio V.

It has the potential to be of great value in clinical diagnosis. One of the major problems in EIT with complex geometry shape is its high demand in computation capability, power, and memory. A generalized finite element method (GFEM) is proposed to calculate the forward problem accurately. Compared with the traditional FEM, a smaller number of nodes and elements with the proposed method are required to achieve the same accuracy in our numerical computation model. The value of signal-to-noise ratio for two-order GFEM is 47 dB, and 10 dB for conventional FEM. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the GFEM in EIT simulation. In the forward solution, it is capable of achieving better accuracy using less computational time and memory with GFEM.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2013.2285161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/6748920/06749240.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2013.2285161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6748920","startPage":"1045","endPage":"1048","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Numerical Computation Forward Problem Model of Electrical Impedance Tomography Based on Generalized Finite Element Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749240","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Numerical Computation Forward Problem Model of Electrical Impedance Tomography Based on Generalized Finite Element Method","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749240/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","isJournal":true,"externalId":"7025904","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"50","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14128181","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6749240/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Numerical Computation Forward Problem Model of Electrical Impedance Tomography Based on Generalized Finite Element Method","sourcePdf":"tmag-zhang-2285161-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064962S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6748920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6748920","articleId":"6749240","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6749261,"authors":[{"name":"W.

A traditional method is to solve a frequency-domain problem of eddy-current fields using FEM and to calculate the parameters in postprocessing. To obtain the parameters at different frequencies, frequency-sweeping is required. However, it is time consuming and inefficient. In this paper, a novel method for impedance extraction is presented. The proposed method only needs to solve a time-domain problem using FEM a few times, then the impedances at all frequencies can be directly obtained.

The major factor to be tackled in the WSN is the network lifetime. A recent WSN routing protocol defined as secure real-time load distribution (SRTLD) uses broadcast packets to perform neighbor discovery and calculation at every hop while transferring data packets. Thus, it has high energy consumption. The proposed novel biological inspired self-organized secure autonomous routing protocol (BIOSARP) enhances SRTLD with an autonomous routing mechanism. In the BIOSARP mechanism, an optimal forwarding decision is obtained using improved ant colony optimization (IACO). In IACO, the pheromone value/probability is computed based on the end-to-end delay, remaining battery power, and link quality metrics. The proposed BIOSARP has been designed to reduce the broadcast and packet overhead in order to minimize the delay, packet loss, and power consumption in the WSN. In this paper, we present the architecture, implementation, and detailed outdoor experimental testbed results of the proposed BIOSARP. These results show that BIOSARP outperforms energy and delay ants algorithm, improved energy-efficient ant-based routing, and SRTLD in simulations and as well as in real testbed experimentation. The empirical study confirmed that BIOSARP offers better performance and can be practically implemented in the WSN applications for structural and environmental monitoring or battlefield surveillance.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2014.2308725","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6819883/06749271.pdf","startPage":"2232","endPage":"2239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2014.2308725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Empirical Studies of Bio-Inspired Self-Organized Secure Autonomous Routing Protocol","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749271/","displayDocTitle":"Empirical Studies of Bio-Inspired Self-Organized Secure Autonomous Routing Protocol","volume":"14","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14331845","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6749271/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004745","fundingName":"Research Center of the College of Computer and Information Sciences, King Saud University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical Studies of Bio-Inspired Self-Organized Secure Autonomous Routing Protocol","sourcePdf":"jsen-saleem-2308725-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09539S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6819883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6819883","articleId":"6749271","onlineDate":"26 February 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6749333,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Pierre P\u00e9ters","affiliation":["CRETH Path asbl, Namur, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"P\u00e9ters","id":"37086764023"},{"name":"Vincent Collin","affiliation":["CRETH Path asbl, Namur, Belgium"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Collin","id":"37086762541"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2540-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5615"}],"articleNumber":"6749333","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Optical sensors","Visualization","Biomedical optical imaging","Optical imaging","Image processing","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handicapped aids","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision systems","people with disabilities","disabled persons","imagery","visually impaired persons","handicap","image processing","universal design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["imagery","handicap","disability","universal design"]}],"abstract":"A lot of difficulties for disabled persons can be attenuated using imagery.

First, wavelet de-noising is applied to the signal. Next, peak-finding algorithms search for smaller anomalies that appear frequently throughout the signal. Then the data from the peak-finding algorithm is fed into a feed-forward neural which predicts the likelihood of an anomalous event occurring later in the signal. The neural network is trained using supervised learning techniques with data sets consisting of a mix of signals known to precede anomalous events, and signals known to be free of significant anomalies. Our approach provides a means of predicting large events in signals such as seismograms, EKGs, EEGs, and other non-stationary signals. The proposed technique yielded 83% accuracy when used to predict earthquakes using seismic signals, and so is an effective strategy for predicting seismic events.","doi":"10.1109/AIPR.2013.6749340","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745851/6749305/06749340.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIPR.2013.6749340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6749305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly prediction in seismic signals using neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749340/","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly prediction in seismic signals using neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14130957","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6749340/","conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly prediction in seismic signals using neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"Waibel43paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074467S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745851","isNumber":"6749305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745851","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6749305","articleId":"6749340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6749341,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron Waibel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Indiana Pennsylvania"],"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Waibel","id":"37086655358"},{"name":"Abdullah Ali Alshehri","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Abdullah Ali","lastName":"Alshehri","id":"37072440200"},{"name":"Soundararajan Ezekiel","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Indiana Pennsylvania"],"firstName":"Soundararajan","lastName":"Ezekiel","id":"37085398346"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2540-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5219"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5615"}],"articleNumber":"6749341","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Pattern recognition","Noise reduction","Discrete Fourier transforms","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","filtering theory","Fourier transforms","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern recognition","signal denoising","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiperspective anomaly prediction","Fourier transform","wavelet denoised signal","filtering","feedforward neural network technique","pattern recognition","neural network training","supervised learning algorithm","event probability","seismic signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet De-noising","Wavelet Thresholding","Neural Network","Pattern Recognition","Anomaly Prediction","Signal Processing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a technique for predicting anomalies in a signal by observing relationships between multiple meaningful transformations of the signal called perspectives. In particular, we use the Fourier transform to provide a holistic view of the frequencies present in a signal, along with a wavelet denoised signal that is filtered to locate anomalous peaks. Then we input these perspectives of the signal into a feedforward neural network technique to recognize patterns in the relationship between perspectives, and the presence of anomalies. The neural network is trained using a supervised learning algorithm for a given data set. Once trained, the neural network outputs the probability of a significant event occurring later in the signal based on anomalies occurring in the early part of the signal. A large collection of seismic signals was used in this study to illustrate the underlying methodology. Using this method we were able to achieve 54.7% accuracy in predicting anomalies further in a seismic signal. The techniques we present in this paper, with some refinement, can readily be applied to detect anomalies in seismic, electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, and other non-stationary signals.","doi":"10.1109/AIPR.2013.6749341","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745851/6749305/06749341.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIPR.2013.6749341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6749305","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-perspective anomaly prediction using neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-perspective anomaly prediction using neural networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749341/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14130949","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6749341/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-perspective anomaly prediction using neural networks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"waibelpaper44.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053829S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745851","isNumber":"6749305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745851","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6749305","articleId":"6749341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6749375,"authors":[{"name":"Jyothi N.","affiliation":["Dept.

Face image is most popular non-intrusive and non-invasive biometrics whose image can easily be taken without user co-operation. Although the existing automated machine recognition systems have certain level of maturity but their accomplishments are limited due to real time challenges and face recognition systems are impressively sensitive to appearance variations due to lighting, expression and aging. The major metric in modeling the performance of a face recognition system is its accuracy of recognition. This paper proposes a novel method which improves the recognition accuracy as well as avoids face datasets being tampered through image splicing techniques. It also avoids generalizability problem which is caused due to subspace discriminant analysis or statistical learning procedure by using a non-statistical procedure which avoids training step for face samples. This proposed method performs well with images with partial occlusion and images with lighting variations as the local patch of the face is divided into several different patches. The performance improvement is shown considerably high in terms of recognition rate and storage space by storing train images in compressed domain and selecting significant features from superset if feature vectors for actual recognition.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Communication, Control, Signal Processing and Computing Applications (C2SPCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6739910/6749343/06749387.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Communication, Control, Signal Processing and Computing Applications (C2SPCA)","doi":"10.1109/C2SPCA.2013.6749387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/C2SPCA.2013.6749387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6749343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749387","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rule based features selection for the performance improvement of face recognition system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Histograms","Gabor filters","Databases","Feature extraction","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biometrics (access control)","face recognition","knowledge based systems","law administration","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rule based features selection","face recognition system","image processing","law enforcement areas","security","face image","non-intrusive biometrics","non-invasive biometrics","subspace discriminant analysis","statistical learning procedure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gabor filter","Local Binary Pattern","Discrete Cosine Transform","Image splicing","False Acceptance Ratio","False rejection Ratio","Performance modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749387/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Rule based features selection for the performance improvement of face recognition system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6749387/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14130835","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","conferenceDate":"10-11 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rule based features selection for the performance improvement of face recognition system","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"031306044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069391S","chronDate":"10-11 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6739910","isNumber":"6749343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6739910","xplore-issue":"6749343","articleId":"6749387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6749406,"authors":[{"name":"Santosh Bhalke","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Nitte Menakshi Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6739910/6749343/6749406/6749406-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Santosh Bhalke received his Bachelor of Engineering degree from Basavaka-lyan Engineering College, Basavakal-yan, Bidar, Karnataka, in the year 2010.

Due to this, multiple radios operate simultaneously in adjacent or overlapping radio frequency spectra and in close physical proximity to each other. In such a scenario, estimation of the received data in the presence of interference due to the adjacent communication system(s) becomes a challenging problem. This interference cannot always be assumed to be completely uncorrelated (orthogonal) to the data of interest. Hence the normally used Least Squares and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) Estimators based on orthogonal projections cannot be used for equalization to estimate the data of interest. In this paper, we discuss how oblique projection operators can be used to mitigate the effects of interference due to an adjacent communication system on the OFDM system of interest. A novel scheme is proposed to cancel the interference using oblique pseudo inverses. Numerical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides significant performance improvement and also better diversity order.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oblique projection based equalization for OFDM in presence of in-device coexistence interference","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Communication, Control, Signal Processing and Computing Applications (C2SPCA)","doi":"10.1109/C2SPCA.2013.6749422","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Communication, Control, Signal Processing and Computing Applications (C2SPCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6739910/6749343/06749422.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/C2SPCA.2013.6749422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6749343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Oblique projection based equalization for OFDM in presence of in-device coexistence interference","conferenceDate":"10-11 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6749422/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14130886","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oblique projection based equalization for OFDM in presence of in-device coexistence interference","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"031306079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04918S","chronDate":"10-11 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6739910","isNumber":"6749343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6739910","xplore-issue":"6749343","articleId":"6749422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6749450,"authors":[{"name":"Adarsh Appaiah","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, PES Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Adarsh","lastName":"Appaiah","id":"37086754842"},{"name":"Akhil Perincherry","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, PES Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Akhil","lastName":"Perincherry","id":"37086754652"},{"name":"Ajinkya Sanjeev Keskar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, PES Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"lastName":"Ajinkya Sanjeev Keskar","id":"37086754415"},{"name":"Vijaya Krishna","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, PES Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Vijaya","lastName":"Krishna","id":"37086756295"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1085-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1082-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6749450","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Detectors","Compressed sensing","Matching pursuit algorithms","Vectors","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","compressed sensing","radio spectrum management","signal detection","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","compressive measurements","spectrum utilization","spectrum sensing technique","compressive signal processing","CSP-based approach","wideband signal sampling","hardware devices","ADC","compressed sensing algorithm","signal reconstruction","inference problem","CSP-based detector"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive Sensing (CS)","Cognitive Radio (CR)","Detection","Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive Radio has attracted a lot of attention in the recent past due to the promise of a better utilization of the available spectrum. However, it faces many constraints in its implementation. Current spectrum sensing techniques are either computationally expensive or are not accurate enough. We propose a compressive signal processing (CSP) based approach for spectrum sensing that provides good accuracy at lower complexity. Since spectrum sensing involves sampling wideband signals, the sampling rates mandated by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling criterion tend be very high. This results in a heavy burden on the hardware devices (ADCs et al) and adds to the computational woes. Compressed sensing seems to be a natural solution to this problem. But typical compressed sensing algorithms involve signal reconstruction, and can be computationally expensive. By noting that spectrum sensing is an inference problem, we adopt the CSP approach that avoids reconstruction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CSP based detector provides high accuracy at a reasonable complexity.","doi":"10.1109/C2SPCA.2013.6749450","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Communication, Control, Signal Processing and Computing Applications (C2SPCA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6739910/6749343/06749450.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6749343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/C2SPCA.2013.6749450","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Emerging Trends in Communication, Control, Signal Processing and Computing Applications (C2SPCA)","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sensing in Cognitive Radio based on compressive measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sensing in Cognitive Radio based on compressive measurements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749450/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6749450/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14130855","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","conferenceDate":"10-11 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sensing in Cognitive Radio based on compressive measurements","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"031306107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062033S","chronDate":"10-11 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6739910","isNumber":"6749343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6739910","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6749343","articleId":"6749450","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6749452,"authors":[{"name":"Pragadeeshwaran P","affiliation":["Bharat Electronics Limited, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6739910/6749343/6749452/6749452-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pragadeeshwaran P received BE degree from Malnad College of engineering in Electronics and Communications.

The method which improves the dynamic range by blocking undesirable input DC offset voltages without use of conventional RC components [1] is free from the errors produced due to their finite tolerances which erroneously convert a part of common mode AC signal into differential signal resulting in to degradation of CMRR of instrumentation amplifier. The mathematical analysis of the circuit based on this method is given in the paper which shows that the loss of dynamic range due to differential DC voltages at input is reduced only to a small common mode voltage. The relationship is expressed in form of new theorem proposed in the paper named as theorem of dynamic range recovery for instrumentation amplifier. Experimental results are obtained using simulation which shows agreement with derived/expected results. Effect of finite source impedances as well as distortion at low frequencies in conventional R-C coupling is also eliminated.

Typically, the business rules are represented in a natural language such as English. Since, the natural languages are naturally ambiguous and one of the reasons of ambiguity is use of logical connectives that can make the NL sentences more ambiguous. Use of logical connectives result in multiple senses of a business rule specifically the XOR role of OR connective makes the things more difficult. To model the Business process specifications and business rules, one need to analyse NL based business rules manually or automatically. During analysis of NL business rules, one had to deal with various occurrences of logical connectives. In this paper, we present a novel approach to identify the type and scope of a logical connective in a target business rule. The presented approach incorporates the Markov Logic approach to handle ambiguity in logical connectives. Initial results of the experiments are also discussed at the end of the paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-12 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14131062","htmlLink":"/document/6749505/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automated analysis of logical connectives in business constraints","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated analysis of logical connectives in business constraints","confLoc":"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"42Paper38.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063601S","chronDate":"11-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745906","isNumber":"6749463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745906","xplore-issue":"6749463","articleId":"6749505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6749530,"authors":[{"name":"Rita Manuela Monteiro Pereira","firstName":"Rita","lastName":"Manuela Monteiro Pereira"},{"name":"Carlos Manuel Machado Ferreira","firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Manuel Machado Ferreira"},{"name":"Fernando Maciel Barbosa","firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Maciel Barbosa"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-0992"}],"articleNumber":"6749530","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2466},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Region 9","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/reg/9/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic voltage control","Static VAr compensators","Rotors","Power system stability","Stability analysis","Load modeling","Power system dynamics","STATCOM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous generators","power system dynamic stability","reactive power control","static VAr compensators","voltage control","voltage regulators","wind power plants","wind turbines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reactive power limit","reactive power handling capacity","flexible AC transmission system devices","FACTS devices","static synchronous compensators","STATCOM","static Var compensators","SVC","dynamic voltage stability","low voltage ride through","LVRT","wind farms","wind turbines","pitch control","fixed speed induction generator","FSIG","asynchronous operation","system voltage instability","reactive power absorption","large rotor slip","wind farm models","EUROSTAG","automatic voltage regulators","AVR","turbine speed governors","under load tap changers","ULTC","dynamic voltage collapse","electric power system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric power systems","STATCOM","SVC","Voltage Stability","Wind Generation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749530","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","pdfPath":"/iel7/9907/6749519/06749530.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TLA.2014.6749530","doi":"10.1109/TLA.2014.6749530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6749519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative study of STATCOM and SVC performance on Dynamic Voltage Collapse of an Electric Power System with Wind Generation","abstract":"One of the major problems of voltage stability is the reactive power limit of the system. Improving the system's reactive power handling capacity via Flexible AC transmission System (FACTS) devices is a solution for prevention of voltage instability. In this paper it is studied the influence of Static Synchronous Compensators (STATCOM) and Static Var Compensators (SVC) in dynamic Voltage Stability during Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT), in wind farms. The wind turbines are equipped with pitch control coupled with a Fixed Speed Induction Generator (FSIG). Due to the nature of asynchronous operation, system voltage instability of wind farms based on FSIG is largely caused by the excessive reactive power absorption by FSIG after a fault due to the large rotor slip gained during fault. Wind farm models based on FSIG and equipped with either STATCOM or SVC are developed in EUROSTAG. The Automatic Voltage Regulators (AVR) of the generating units and the turbine speed governors were modeled in detail. Different load models were used and the Under Load Tap Changers (ULTC) were also taken into account. Finally, some conclusions that provide a better understanding of the dynamic voltage stability of a system with FSIG model during LVRT, using various capacities of STATCOM and SVC are pointed out.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749530/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 February 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","volume":"12","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"14128442","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Comparative study of STATCOM and SVC performance on Dynamic Voltage Collapse of an Electric Power System with Wind Generation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative study of STATCOM and SVC performance on Dynamic Voltage Collapse of an Electric Power System with Wind Generation","sourcePdf":"12TLA2_11ManuelaMonteiroPereira.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02943S","chronDate":"March  2014","isNumber":"6749519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9907","citationCount":"32","articleId":"6749530","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6749594,"authors":[{"name":"Sudip Ghosh","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur Howrah, India"],"firstName":"Sudip","lastName":"Ghosh","id":"37532778000"},{"name":"Santi P.

To keep the integrity and ensure the accuracy and reliability of the digital image, we need some sort of robust methods and standard procedures that guarantee the strengthen authenticity of digital image. image authentication is a technique that analyze a digital image and determine if it has been altered. Image authentication technique can be used for various organizations such as health care organizations, law enforcement agencies and insurance companies etc. Image authentication is also important in content delivery via untrusted intermediaries, such as peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing. untrusted intermediaries might tamper the contents of image. Distinguishing the legitimate diversity of encodings from malicious manipulation is the challenge addressed in this paper. We developed a LDPC based new approach for image authentication. With the help of this approach we can authenticate image effectively. In our technique, we provide LDPC quantized image projection and the Encrypted image digest as authentication data. These data can be correctly decoded only with the help of an authentic image as side information. This technique provides the desired robustness against legitimate encoding variations, while detecting illegitimate modification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14130814","htmlLink":"/document/6749628/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"LDPC based image authentication system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC based image authentication system","confLoc":"Allahabad, India","sourcePdf":"313134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094231S","chronDate":"20-22 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6739906","isNumber":"6749587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6739906","xplore-issue":"6749587","articleId":"6749628","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6749661,"authors":[{"name":"Dung Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona at Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Dung","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37405920000"},{"name":"Kui Ren","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, State University of New York (SUNY), Buffalo, New York, USA"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Ren","id":"37288795500"},{"name":"Janet Roveda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona at Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Janet","lastName":"Roveda","id":"37601399700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1166-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-1676"}],"articleNumber":"6749661","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Breast","Abstracts","Cancer","Chaos","Medical diagnostic imaging","Magnetic resonance imaging","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","compressed sensing","computerised tomography","data acquisition","image sampling","mammography","medical image processing","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data acquisition design","breast cancer detection system","mammography screening","computed tomography techniques","cancer detection rate","SoC designs","raw data","multidimensional tomosynthesis","comparable X-ray dose","core technologies","Adaptive Digital Estimator","ADE","Self-detecting sensory array","Compressive Sensing","inter-reset sampling techniques","high speed data acquisition","data amount reduction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749661","abstract":"Modern mammography screening for breast cancer detection adopted computed tomography techniques and multi-dimensional (i.e. 3D or 4D) Tomosynthesis to improve cancer detection rate.

Furthermore, TSV takes much larger size and pitch than the normal logic components. For this reason, a careful allocation of the TSV resource has been required in 3D IC designs, and several works have been proposed to allocate TSVs minimally or economically. This work addresses the problem of TSV allocation and optimization to overcome one of the critical limitations of the previous works, which is the unawareness or no exploitation of the possibility of TSV resource sharing, previously merely resorting to a simple binding of the data transfers to TSVs. This is because the previous 3D layer partitioners have performed TSV allocation and minimization without any link to the data transfer information accessible from the high-level synthesis flow. This work proposes two TSV resource sharing and optimization algorithms (as a post-processing of 3D layer partitioning) which make use of the life time information of the data transfers taken from the high-level synthesis. Precisely, we propose two algorithms for TSV resource sharing and optimization, which can be selectively applied depending on the sharing granularity and design complexity: word-level TSV sharing and bit-level TSV sharing. Through experiments with benchmark designs, it is confirmed that our proposed algorithms are able to reduce the number of TSVs by 10.5%~41.1% in word-level TSV sharing and 15.5% ~ 45.1% in bit-level TSV sharing at the expense of 2.0% ~ 18.1% increase of 2D wirelength compared with the results produced by the conventional layer partitioning with no TSV sharing while still meeting the timing constraint of designs.","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International SOC Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745905/6749643/06749680.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2013.6749680","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2013.6749680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6749643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-level TSV resource sharing and optimization for TSV based 3D IC designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-level TSV resource sharing and optimization for TSV based 3D IC designs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749680/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6749680/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14131024","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-level TSV resource sharing and optimization for TSV based 3D IC designs","confLoc":"Erlangen, Germany","sourcePdf":"TA1A2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058652S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745905","isNumber":"6749643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745905","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6749643","articleId":"6749680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6749681,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hung Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Chia-Hung","lastName":"Liu","id":"38542099500"},{"name":"Kuang-Cheng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Kuang-Cheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086770427"},{"name":"Juinn-Dar Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Juinn-Dar","lastName":"Huang","id":"37293535900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1166-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-1676"}],"articleNumber":"6749681","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Minimization","Arrays","Sequential analysis","Mixers","Electrodes","Proteins","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital microfluidic biochips","bioelectronics","biochemical assays","latency-optimization synthesis algorithm","LOSMOS","module selection capability","ILP-based method","storage minimization scheduling"]}],"abstract":"Digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) is one of the latest developments in bioelectronics.

The proposed network adapter achieves high frequency of 650MHz with a low area footprint (952 cells, approximate to 2; 793\u03bcm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n with a CMOS 45nm technology) by using an effective micro-architecture and with zero latency by using the mux-selection method.","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2013.6749691","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International SOC Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745905/6749643/06749691.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2013.6749691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6749643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance adaption of ARM processors into Network-on-Chip architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749691","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749691/","displayDocTitle":"High-performance adaption of ARM processors into Network-on-Chip architectures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14131016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6749691/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance adaption of ARM processors into Network-on-Chip architectures","confLoc":"Erlangen, Germany","sourcePdf":"TP1B3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071809S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745905","isNumber":"6749643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745905","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6749643","articleId":"6749691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6749709,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Fang","affiliation":["Technische Universitaet Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Fang","id":"37076700700"},{"name":"Ashok Jaiswal","affiliation":["Technische Universitaet Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany"],"firstName":"Ashok","lastName":"Jaiswal","id":"37901091800"},{"name":"Klaus Hofmann","affiliation":["Technische Universitaet Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Hofmann","id":"37375118300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1166-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-1706"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-1676"}],"articleNumber":"6749709","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6749709","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Training","Software packages","Low earth orbit satellites","Abstracts","Random access memory","Voltage-controlled oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalisers","clocks","DRAM chips","intersymbol interference","least mean squares methods","low-power electronics","phase locked loops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power signal integrity trainings","multiclock source-synchronous memory systems","advanced high-speed multiclock source-synchronous systems","GDDR5 DRAM","phase interpolator","PI-based phase-locked loop","PLL architecture","adaptive equalization training","GDDR5 memory system","inter-symbol interference","ISI compensation","memory controller","low power design","GDDR5 memory interface","least mean square algorithm","LMS algorithm","pilot signal-peak detection","horizontal eye opening","vertical eye opening"]}],"abstract":"Advanced high-speed multi-clock source-synchronous systems such as GDDR5 employ different trainings to ensure the signal integrity for high bandwidth applications. Through these trainings proper timing relationships among data and clocks are defined in the initialization phase. In this paper, a multi-clock synchronization training using phase interpolator (PI)-based phase-locked loop (PLL) architecture is proposed, which consumes 11.7 times less power and 27 times less area than other works. In addition, an adaptive equalization training is introduced for a GDDR5 memory system to compensate for inter-symbol interference (ISI). For the low power design, the equalizers are applied only in the memory controller utilizing the existing GDDR5 memory interface. This system architecture aimed of low-power design is verified by using least mean square (LMS) and pilot signal/peak detection. Results show that LMS algorithm improves the vertical and horizontal eye opening by more than 30% and 10%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/SOCC.2013.6749709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6749643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOCC.2013.6749709","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International SOC Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International SOC Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6745905/6749643/06749709.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power signal integrity trainings for multi-clock source-synchronous memory systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Low-power signal integrity trainings for multi-clock source-synchronous memory systems","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6749709/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14130965","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749709/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power signal integrity trainings for multi-clock source-synchronous memory systems","confLoc":"Erlangen, Germany","sourcePdf":"FA1A1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064774S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6745905","isNumber":"6749643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6745905","xplore-issue":"6749643","articleId":"6749709","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6749710,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Yu Lu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics Eng. & Inst. of Electronics, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, R.

The proposed system consists of several renewable energy supply sources and a secondary battery connected to the DC bus line while load and utility-grid are connected to the AC bus line. When the renewable energy power becomes lower than the demand, additional power is supplied from the secondary battery and the utility-grid. To optimally control the state of energy balance, it is necessary to develop a simulator for operational analysis. In addition, verification of simulation and emulation using real devices is essential. As for realization of emulator, a high-speed simulator is effective in predicting and analyzing system that incorporate energy usage patterns, running cost, and other factors. The proposed micro-grid emulator can realize seamless operation between simulation and emulation by using our revolutionary model. The verification results show that the proposed simulator and emulator are effective in the energy management strategies and to draw up optimum control operation of micro-grid

The control of the FES unit is based on a wind speed forecasting technique by the RBF neural network. A new control strategy adopting different reference DC bus voltages under different forecasting wind speeds is presented to improve the output power regulation capability of the FES unit. The wind speeds in the next time array can be accurately forecasted by the radical basis function (RBF) neural network. The mathematical model of a stand-alone wind power generation system including a FES unit is established and simulated by Matlab/Simulink. The simulation results verify the correctness of the system model and the effectiveness of the control method.","doi":"10.1109/ICRERA.2013.6749855","pdfPath":"/iel7/6739909/6749720/06749855.pdf","startPage":"763","endPage":"768","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA)","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications (ICRERA)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICRERA.2013.6749855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6749720","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of wind power system involving flywheel energy storage unit based on wind speed forecasting by RBF neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6749855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Simulation of wind power system involving flywheel energy storage unit based on wind speed forecasting by RBF neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14198816","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6749855/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of wind power system involving flywheel energy storage unit based on wind speed forecasting by RBF neural network","confLoc":"Madrid","sourcePdf":"276fengsimulationof.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066097S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6739909","isNumber":"6749720","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6739909","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6749720","articleId":"6749855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"}]
