The value of the ground resistance greatly depends on the grounding system and the properties of the soil, where the system is embedded. Given that the value of soil resistivity fluctuates during the year, the ground resistance does not have one single value. The approach proposed in this paper, takes advantage of the capability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to recognize linear and non-linear relationships between various parameters. By taking into account measurements of resistivity and rainfall data accrued for previous days, the ground resistance is estimated. On that purpose ANNs have been trained and validated by using experimental data in order to examine their ability to predict the ground resistance. The results prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6110235/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12443306","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6110235/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network approach on the seasonal variation of soil resistance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network approach on the seasonal variation of soil resistance","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060547S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095478","isNumber":"6110111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095478","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6110111","articleId":"6110235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6110239,"authors":[{"name":"Mi Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Mi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37894169300"},{"name":"Hua Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38240803200"},{"name":"Li Cai","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Cai","id":"37893581500"},{"name":"Xuan Fan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Fan","id":"37895497100"},{"name":"Jianping Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jianping","lastName":"Wang","id":"38090122000"},{"name":"Shengxi Dai","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shengxi","lastName":"Dai","id":"38235929200"},{"name":"Jian Xue","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Xue","id":"37896147200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1466-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1467-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-1465-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6110239","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6110239","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surges","Surge protection","Computers","Generators","Couplings","Immunity testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic compatibility","lightning protection","power cables","surge protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["surge immunity test","personal computer","power lines","electromagnetic compatibility","surge voltage","surge current","lightning protection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["surge","immunity test","combination wave generator","coupling/decoupling network","EMC"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with problems arising at Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) in relation to the interference caused by surge voltages and currents. For this purpose, IEC 61000-4-5 Standard has been instituted, describing the procedure of testing and verification of a device for immunity against surge. Specifically, measurements and tests were performed on an investigation of surge immunity of a personal computer at power lines. Response of the testing computer under different coupling modes of the surges and different test levers were presented. The results implied that when the surges were applied between phases or the phase shifting was 90\u00b0 or 270\u00b0, the tested personal computer's surge immunity was lower. The information in this paper can also be used in the lightning protection design by the computer manufacturer.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APL.2011.6110239","doi":"10.1109/APL.2011.6110239","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 7th Asia-Pacific International Conference on Lightning","pdfPath":"/iel5/6095478/6110111/06110239.pdf","startPage":"813","endPage":"816","publicationTitle":"2011 7th Asia-Pacific International Conference on Lightning","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surge immunity test of personal computer at power lines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Surge immunity test of personal computer at power lines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6110239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Nov. 2011","conferenceDate":"1-4 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12443310","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6110239/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surge immunity test of personal computer at power lines","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047062S","chronDate":"1-4 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6095478","isNumber":"6110111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6095478","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6110111","articleId":"6110239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6110383,"authors":[{"name":"Keijiro Suzuki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Keijiro","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37673062100"},{"name":"Hong C.

We use two methods of seizure detection for evaluate new of statistic feature. Initially, features are extracted from EEG signals by using discrete wavelet transform. Next, a set of statistical features are extracted from each frequency sub-band to represent the distribution of wavelet coefficients. We suggest three new statistical features, fourth moment divided by second moment, difference between maximum and minimum, and zero-crossing of the wavelet coefficients. We demonstrate proposed features are very efficient for EEG classification and cause to improve correct classification rate (CCR). So, we use a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) for features selection. Next, the resultant data are applied to the classifiers. Two classifiers are employed: K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) and Bayesian. The data are classified into three categories: healthy volunteers, epilepsy patients during seizure-free interval and epilepsy patients during seizure. The experimental results indicate that performance of our method in EEG classification signals outperforms previously presented methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seizure detection using wavelet transform and a new statistical feature","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT)","doi":"10.1109/ICAICT.2011.6110942","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6097604/6110878/06110942.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAICT.2011.6110942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110878","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6110942","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6110942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Seizure detection using wavelet transform and a new statistical feature","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6110942/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12460302","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seizure detection using wavelet transform and a new statistical feature","confLoc":"Baku, Azerbaijan","sourcePdf":"s427.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062776S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6097604","isNumber":"6110878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6097604","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6110878","articleId":"6110942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6110972,"authors":[{"name":"Meltem Ozen","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Meltem","lastName":"Ozen","id":"37681301800"},{"name":"Suleyman Tosun","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey"],"firstName":"Suleyman","lastName":"Tosun","id":"37422283000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-832-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-831-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-830-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6110972","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6110972","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Tiles","Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Low voltage","Timing","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","energy consumption","genetic algorithms","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","NoC design","voltage-frequency islands","network-on-chip architecture","clock distribution","energy management","global asynchronous locally synchronous systems","GALS","VFI","energy consumption"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICAICT.2011.6110972","pdfPath":"/iel5/6097604/6110878/06110972.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAICT.2011.6110972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm based NoC design with voltage/frequency islands","abstract":"Due to increasing complexity of the embedded applications, designing a Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture under energy, cost, and performance constraints has become challenging issue.

NoC communication infrastructure allows us to design globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS) systems, which suits well for energy minimization and clock speed control. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm based method that maps the tasks of the given application onto two different voltage/frequency islands (VFIs) to minimize the total energy consumption of the system. We compared the proposed method with the one that does not consider VFI. Our experiments on several benchmarks show that VFI based method brings up to 37% energy reduction under given timing constraint.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6110972/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12460332","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6110972/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm based NoC design with voltage/frequency islands","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm based NoC design with voltage/frequency islands","confLoc":"Baku, Azerbaijan","sourcePdf":"s604.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062143S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6097604","isNumber":"6110878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6097604","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6110878","articleId":"6110972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6110989,"authors":[{"name":"Valery Sklyarov","affiliation":["DETI/IEETA/HIPEAC, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Valery","lastName":"Sklyarov","id":"37371704800"},{"name":"Iouliia Skliarova","affiliation":["DETI/IEETA/HIPEAC, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Iouliia","lastName":"Skliarova","id":"37284663400"},{"name":"Alexander Sudnitson","affiliation":["Computer Department/HIPEAC, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Sudnitson","id":"37283482500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-832-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-831-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-830-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6110989","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6110989","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Computers","Educational institutions","Software","Design automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","electronic engineering computing","electronic engineering education","engineering education","field programmable gate arrays","groupware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based systems","engineering education","University of Aveiro","HP mobile technology","interactive learning","collaborative lerning","Hewlett Packard","reconfigurable systems teaching","computer engineering curricula","electrical engineering curricula"]}],"abstract":"This tutorial is intended to give introduction to FPGA-based systems, to illustrate advantages of these systems in terms of technical characteristics and economic aspects, to demonstrate design steps on practical examples, and to discuss potential benefits and case studies targeted to the scope of the conference.

In case of other diversity techniques are not available (e.g., for a quasi-static fading channel), it is still a simple and efficient way to apply. Alamouti scheme is the earliest implementation of the Space-Time Code. It is easier to extend to multi-antenna case and further to perform transmitter diversity and receiver diversity as well. The decoding process of the scheme could be carried out with a linear complexity, so it is easier for the terminal to perform the decoding process within limited resources. An Alamouti scheme is integrated with a DS-QPSK-CDMA system and images are transferred through the simulation system with different SNR. It shows the simulation system works well, and the quality of image after transferring by the system is consistent with the BER performance simulation and analysis results of the simulation system. In addition, a typical MIMO simulation system usually suppose that the multiple antenna channels are synchronized by default, however, a different simulation result is given in this paper, in which the sub-streams are not synchronized. It shows synchronization of the parallel channels has great effect on the performance of a multiple antenna system.","doi":"10.1109/ICAICT.2011.6110991","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6097604/6110878/06110991.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAICT.2011.6110991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation and analysis of a STBC-DSQPSK-CDMA scheme with image transferring experiments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6110991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6110991/","displayDocTitle":"Simulation and analysis of a STBC-DSQPSK-CDMA scheme with image transferring experiments","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12460351","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6110991/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation and analysis of a STBC-DSQPSK-CDMA scheme with image transferring experiments","confLoc":"Baku, Azerbaijan","sourcePdf":"s623.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054511S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6097604","isNumber":"6110878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6097604","xplore-issue":"6110878","articleId":"6110991","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6111007,"authors":[{"name":"Feraydune Kashefi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Shabestar, Iran"],"firstName":"Feraydune","lastName":"Kashefi","id":"37860270800"},{"name":"Mojtaba Majdi","affiliation":["Telecommunication Company of iran, Mashhad, Iran"],"firstName":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Majdi","id":"38242004100"},{"name":"Mehdi Darbandi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Gonabad, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Darbandi","id":"38236279300"},{"name":"Hoda Purhosein","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Gonabad, Iran"],"firstName":"Hoda","lastName":"Purhosein","id":"38234642100"},{"name":"Khalil Alizadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Gonabad, Iran"],"firstName":"Khalil","lastName":"Alizadeh","id":"38232045300"},{"name":"Ozra Atae","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Gonabad, Iran"],"firstName":"Ozra","lastName":"Atae","id":"38234641400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-832-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-831-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-830-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6111007","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Europe","USA Councils","Education","Green products"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer games","information technology","next generation networks","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","cloud location information","Internet","service reliability","next generation data centers","virtual technology","demand conditions","trading","news reading","movies","online games","information technology","nonmilitary purpose","military purpose","large scale network","file security","information security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing and its influences","security","evolutionary algorithms","recognition methods"]}],"abstract":"Cloud is a virtual image about an environment that it's widespread and powers are unknown, and because of we haven't any information about clouds location and time dimensions and also the amounts of its sources we tell that Cloud Computing [1].

Cloud computing is reliable services that presenting by next generation data centers and from internet, they based on virtual technologies and computes [4]. In recent decades the internet has very deep influences in human lives and in offer and demand conditions; lots of people for trading, reading the news, seeing the movies or to play online games go through the internet. As our daily needs from the internet became more, so that the processing power should increase significantly [8]. With remarkable developments of communication and information technology in recent days, we consider processing and processing power as the fifth vital instrument in human lives (after water, electricity, gas and telephone) [9]. These days lots of technologies migrate from traditional systems into cloud, we should note that cloud can be used for military and non-military purposes [3]. On the other hand, in such a large scale network we should consider the security of files and information, because if we tranquilize the people and organizations about the security of such networks they became more eager to migrate to this new technology. In this paper, at first we consider significant influences of this technology on some of the biggest companies and organizations all over the world, after that we present our new ideas about increasing security of such networks [1] to [6].","doi":"10.1109/ICAICT.2011.6111007","publicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 5th International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technologies (AICT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6097604/6110878/06111007.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAICT.2011.6111007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perusal about influences of cloud computing on the processes of these days and presenting new ideas about its security","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111007","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111007/","displayDocTitle":"Perusal about influences of cloud computing on the processes of these days and presenting new ideas about its security","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12460367","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6111007/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perusal about influences of cloud computing on the processes of these days and presenting new ideas about its security","confLoc":"Baku, Azerbaijan","sourcePdf":"s702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11654S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6097604","isNumber":"6110878","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6097604","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6110878","articleId":"6111007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6111026,"authors":[{"name":"Behrooz Zali Varghahan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Behrooz Zali","lastName":"Varghahan","id":"38235067600"},{"name":"Mehdi Chehel Amirani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi Chehel","lastName":"Amirani","id":"37713899600"},{"name":"Sara Mihandoost","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Mihandoost","id":"38235067200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-832-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-831-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-830-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6111026","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Handwriting recognition","Backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten character recognition","image denoising","image enhancement","image recognition","image segmentation","learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwritten data cleaning","handwritten data enhancement","threshold technical","artificial neural network","scanned image enhancement","image recognition","noise reduction","multilayer perceptron","supervised method","scan machine","image cleaning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["threshold technical","artificial neural network","handwritten recognition","clean image","multilayer perceptron"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111026","abstract":"This paper propos the use threshold technical and artificial neural network (ANN) for clean and enhancement scanned image for recognition task. we show noise reduction and cleaning image can used different filter that result is not gratify.

Most evacuation systems consist of a indoor positioning system, a back-end database, and a display device with calculation and display software. However, very few of them can smartly determine which evacuation route is the best decision. If all the locations of the evacuating people can be simultaneously determined, the best evacuation routes can be decided to avoid congestion, and survival rate can increase. The previous radio frequency identification (RFID) based evacuation system focused on detecting the RFID tags using a mobile phone in order to determine the location of the mobile phone user so that an evacuation route can be displayed. However, the system is available for one person regardless of the number of evacuating people or exits. This study is based on the previous RFID based evacuation system investigating the best evacuation routes. The system introduces cloud computing that calculates for positioning the evacuating people and determining the optimum evacuation routes for each of them.

In this paper we study the performance of coded systems using this type of precoding and compare it to bulk selection and per-tone selection when all antennas are used. The diversity is the same for all three schemes but the analysis shows that the coding gain of the combined scheme is superior to the bulk selection and not much worse than per-tone selection. These conclusions are verified by simulations and show that bulk antenna selection with subsequent per-tone selection is an effective way of achieving good performance with limited cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6165696/06111188.pdf","startPage":"655","endPage":"660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.121511.110056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.121511.110056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of Combined Bulk and Per-Tone Antenna Selection Precoding in Coded OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Signal to noise ratio","OFDM","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","OFDM modulation","precoding","radiocommunication","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bulk antenna selection precoding","per tone antenna selection precoding","coded OFDM system","signal precoding","multiantenna OFDM systems","antenna subset selection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna selection","precoding","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Combined Bulk and Per-Tone Antenna Selection Precoding in Coded OFDM Systems","volume":"60","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6111188/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12576989","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Combined Bulk and Per-Tone Antenna Selection Precoding in Coded OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"655-tc1203-sandell.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07075S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6165696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6165696","articleId":"6111188","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6111189,"authors":[{"name":"Myung-Kyu Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myung-Kyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37537974200"},{"name":"Seung-Chan Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Chan","lastName":"Lim","id":"37086069580"},{"name":"Kyeongcheol Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyeongcheol","lastName":"Yang","id":"37334970200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"6111189","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":948},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"A blind algorithm is proposed in order to compensate for the phase noise resulting from imperfect oscillators in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems over constant modulus modulation. In the proposed algorithm, one received OFDM symbol is partitioned into subblocks in the time domain and the phase noise over each subblock is approximated as its time-average. Under the approximation, the squared magnitude of the channel gain multiplied by the data symbol at each subcarrier is shown to be expressed in terms of these time-averages and the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) coefficients of the received samples at each subblock with zero padding. Based on the relation, the proposed algorithm compensates for the phase noise without pilot symbols. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional algorithms as well as it requires lower computational complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6165696/06111189.pdf","startPage":"620","endPage":"625","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.121511.110088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.121511.110088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Compensation for Phase Noise in OFDM Systems over Constant Modulus Modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","OFDM","Approximation algorithms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Phase modulation","Time domain analysis","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","computational complexity","discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","phase noise","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind compensation algorithm","phase noise","OFDM systems","constant modulus modulation","imperfect oscillators","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","time domain","channel gain","data symbol","discrete Fourier transform","DFT coefficients","pilot symbols","computational complexity","zero padding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system","phase noise compensation","blind algorithm","constant modulus modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Blind Compensation for Phase Noise in OFDM Systems over Constant Modulus Modulation","volume":"60","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6111189/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12576990","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Compensation for Phase Noise in OFDM Systems over Constant Modulus Modulation","sourcePdf":"620-tc1203-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088643S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6165696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6165696","articleId":"6111189","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6111190,"authors":[{"name":"Hyukmin Son","affiliation":["4G Standardization and System Research Group, Mobile Communication Technology Research Lab, LG Electronics Limited, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6148120/6111190/6111190-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hyukmin Son was born in Korea in 1981.

In this work, we prove that the effective channel gains in the space limited by an N_R x M_T MIMO channel form a min(M_T,N_R)-dimensional ellipsoid in the channel space. Utilizing the geometric proof, the achievable effective channel gain is derived as a function of its direction for a given MIMO channel. Based on the derivation, we finally propose a quantization vector selection criterion and an optimal receive combiner to maximize the SINR. The proposed maximum SINR based combining (MSC) is proven to be a better solution for maximizing the SINR compared to quantization based combining (QBC) and maximum gain based combining (MGC), each of which attempts to minimize quantization errors and maximize the effective channel gain.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.121511.110144","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6148120/06111190.pdf","startPage":"559","endPage":"568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.121511.110144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multi-User MIMO Downlink Receiver and Quantizer Design Based on SINR Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111190/","displayDocTitle":"A Multi-User MIMO Downlink Receiver and Quantizer Design Based on SINR Optimization","volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12525152","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6111190/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multi-User MIMO Downlink Receiver and Quantizer Design Based on SINR Optimization","sourcePdf":"559-tc1202-son.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069043S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6148120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6148120","articleId":"6111190","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6111191,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed A.

A slow-fading channel model is considered and the outage probability is derived as a performance measure. The diversity gain defined as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) exponent at high SNR is analyzed. Interestingly in the presence of misalignment fading the diversity gain depends only on the misalignment variance and is independent of the number of transmitters M and receivers N. Increasing the number of transmitters and receivers only results in a lower probability of outage for a given SNR, however, the rate of change is unaffected. Contrary to this case, the diversity gain of MIMO FSO systems in the presence of atmospheric fading and no misalignment is shown to be proportional to the number of transmitters and receivers, in particular the product MN.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.121611.110181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6148120/06111191.pdf","startPage":"479","endPage":"487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.121611.110181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity Gain and Outage Probability for MIMO Free-Space Optical Links with Misalignment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111191/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","displayDocTitle":"Diversity Gain and Outage Probability for MIMO Free-Space Optical Links with Misalignment","volume":"60","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12525153","htmlLink":"/document/6111191/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity Gain and Outage Probability for MIMO Free-Space Optical Links with Misalignment","sourcePdf":"479-tc1202-farid.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087561S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6148120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6148120","articleId":"6111191","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6111219,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7381-6811-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6111219","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":134,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":12364},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Power System Relaying and Control of the IEEE Power and Energy Society"}],"abstract":"Synchronized phasor (synchrophasor) measurements for power systems are presented.

Since the scheme relies on the centralized transmitter's ability to reconstruct all the interference seen in previous symbols, it is not clear if retrospective interference alignment can be applied in interference networks consisting of distributed transmitters and receivers, where interference is contributed by multiple transmitters, each of whom can reconstruct only the part of the interference caused by themselves. In this work, we prove that even in such settings, retrospective interference alignment is feasible. Specifically, we show that it is possible to achieve more than 1 degrees of freedom (DoF) based on only delayed CSIT in the 3-user interference channel and the 2-user X channel consisting of only single antenna nodes. Retrospective interference alignment is also shown to be possible in other settings, such as the 2-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel and with delayed channel output feedback.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2181155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6198766/06111234.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2181155","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6198766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Retrospective Interference Alignment Over Interference Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111234/","displayDocTitle":"Retrospective Interference Alignment Over Interference Networks","volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12713277","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6111234/","dateOfInsertion":"11 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retrospective Interference Alignment Over Interference Networks","sourcePdf":"jstsp-maleki-2181155-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064685S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6198766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"6198766","articleId":"6111234","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6111235,"authors":[{"name":"Ala'a Al-Habashna","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Saint John's, NEW, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6130608/6111235/6111235-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ala'a Al-Habashna received the B.S. degree (with excellent assessment) in computer engineering from Mu'tah University, Karak Governorate, Jordan, in 2006, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, NL, Canada, in 2010.

To adequately adapt to the changing radio environment, it is necessary for the CR to detect the presence and classify the on-the-air signals. The wireless industry has shown great interest in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology. Hence, classification of OFDM signals has been intensively researched recently. Generic signals have been mainly considered, and there is a need to investigate OFDM standard signals, and their specific discriminating features for classification. In this paper, realistic and comprehensive mathematical models of the OFDM-based mobile Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) and third-Generation Partnership Project Long Term Evolution (3GPP LTE) signals are developed, and their second-order cyclostationarity is studied. Closed-from expressions for the cyclic autocorrelation function (CAF) and cycle frequencies (CFs) of both signal types are derived, based on which an algorithm is proposed for their classification. The proposed algorithm does not require carrier, waveform, and symbol timing recovery, and is immune to phase, frequency, and timing offsets. The classification performance of the algorithm is investigated versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), for diverse observation intervals and channel conditions. In addition, the computational complexity is explored versus the signal type. Simulation results show the efficiency of the algorithm is terms of classification performance, and the complexity study proves the real time applicability of the algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2174773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6130608/06111235.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2174773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6130608","startPage":"26","endPage":"42","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Second-Order Cyclostationarity of Mobile WiMAX and LTE OFDM Signals and Application to Spectrum Awareness in Cognitive Radio Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111235","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Second-Order Cyclostationarity of Mobile WiMAX and LTE OFDM Signals and Application to Spectrum Awareness in Cognitive Radio Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111235/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471855","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6111235/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second-Order Cyclostationarity of Mobile WiMAX and LTE OFDM Signals and Application to Spectrum Awareness in Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"jstsp-popescu-2174773-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130456S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6130608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6130608","articleId":"6111235","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6111237,"authors":[{"name":"Angela Demetriadou","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Demetriadou","id":"38234576900"},{"name":"Yang Hao","affiliation":["Electronic Engineering Department, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Hao","id":"37269783400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6111237","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1348},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111237","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lenses","Antenna feeds","Bandwidth","Directive antennas","Metamaterials","Beam steering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lens antennas","microstrip antennas","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grounded slim Luneburg lens antenna","transformation electromagnetics","patch antenna","high-directive antenna system","numerical simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beam steering","directive antennas","Luneburg lens antenna","metamaterials","steerable antennas","transformation electromagnetics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2011.2180884","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/5730210/06111237.pdf","startPage":"1590","endPage":"1593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2011.2180884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5730210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Grounded Slim Luneburg Lens Antenna Based on Transformation Electromagnetics","abstract":"A slim Luneburg lens is proposed, which allows the lens to be incorporated into an antenna system through transformation electromagnetics.

Results demonstrate that a grounded slim lens antenna preserves its original properties of Luneburg lenses, while it can be made conformal to any platform.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","volume":"10","accessionNumber":"12513900","publicationDate":"2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6111237/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Grounded Slim Luneburg Lens Antenna Based on Transformation Electromagnetics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Grounded Slim Luneburg Lens Antenna Based on Transformation Electromagnetics","sourcePdf":"lawp-hao-2180884-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052187S","chronDate":"2011","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"5730210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5730210","articleId":"6111237","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6111262,"authors":[{"name":"Chunhua Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chunhua","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406603500"},{"name":"K.

Due to adopting the double-stator topology, these PM machines achieve the higher energy transmission and power conversion than the single-stator counterparts. Also, the design for the proposed machines are to respectively use the flux-modulation pole, HTS bulk and the flux-modulation ring for modulating the low speed rotating field of the PM rotor and the high speed rotating field of the armature windings, hence obtaining the gear effect for low speed operation. It should be noted that by using the HTS bulks can not only efficiently improve the flux modulation effect of the vernier machine, but also greatly reduce the machine flux leakage. By using the finite-element-method, their performances are compared, hence verifying the validity of the machine design.","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2011.2180870","pdfPath":"/iel5/77/6214630/06111262.pdf","startPage":"5202405","endPage":"5202405","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2011.2180870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6214630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative Comparison of Double-Stator Permanent Magnet Vernier Machines With and Without HTS Bulks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative Comparison of Double-Stator Permanent Magnet Vernier Machines With and Without HTS Bulks","volume":"22","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 June 2012","accessionNumber":"12783737","publicationDate":"June 2012","externalId":"5202405","htmlLink":"/document/6111262/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative Comparison of Double-Stator Permanent Magnet Vernier Machines With and Without HTS Bulks","sourcePdf":"tasc-liu-2180870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0575S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"6214630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6214630","articleId":"6111262","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6111268,"authors":[{"name":"Timo Gerkmann","affiliation":["Speech Signal Processing Group, Universit\u00e4t Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/6145765/6111268/6111268-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Timo Gerkmann (M'10) studied electrical engineering at the universities of Bremen and Bochum, Germany, and received the Dipl.-Ing. degree and the Dr.-Ing. degree from the Institute of Communication Acoustics (IKA), Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Bochum, Germany, in 2004 and 2010, respectively.","From January 2005 to July 2005, he was with Siemens Corporate Research, Princeton, NJ.

We show that the resulting estimator can be interpreted as a voice activity detector (VAD)-based noise power estimator, where the noise power is updated only when speech absence is signaled, compensated with a required bias compensation. We show that the bias compensation is unnecessary when we replace the VAD by a soft speech presence probability (SPP) with fixed priors. Choosing fixed priors also has the benefit of decoupling the noise power estimator from subsequent steps in a speech enhancement framework, such as the estimation of the speech power and the estimation of the clean speech. We show that the proposed speech presence probability (SPP) approach maintains the quick noise tracking performance of the bias compensated minimum mean-square error (MMSE)-based approach while exhibiting less overestimation of the spectral noise power and an even lower computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2180896","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6145765/06111268.pdf","startPage":"1383","endPage":"1393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2180896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unbiased MMSE-Based Noise Power Estimation With Low Complexity and Low Tracking Delay","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111268/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"Unbiased MMSE-Based Noise Power Estimation With Low Complexity and Low Tracking Delay","volume":"20","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12536611","htmlLink":"/document/6111268/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unbiased MMSE-Based Noise Power Estimation With Low Complexity and Low Tracking Delay","sourcePdf":"tasl-gerkmann-2180896-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174596S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6145765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"304","xplore-issue":"6145765","articleId":"6111268","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6111276,"authors":[{"name":"Naveen Kulkarni","affiliation":["Research in Motion Corporation, Irving, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6193248/6111276/6111276-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Naveen Kulkarni received the B.E. degree from Visvesvaraya Technological University, Karnataka, India, in 2006, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Arizona State University (ASU), Tempe, in 2011.","He is currently a Video Systems Engineer with Research in Motion Corporation, Waterloo, ON, Canada.

In this paper, we investigate the application of CS paradigms on single image super-resolution (SR) problems that are considered to be the most challenging in this class. In light of recent promising results, we propose novel tools for analyzing sparse representation-based inverse problems using redundant dictionary basis. Further, we provide novel results establishing tighter correspondence between SR and CS. As such, we gain insights into questions concerning regularizing the solution to the underdetermined problem, such as follows. 1) Is sparsity prior alone sufficient? 2) What is a good dictionary? 3) What is the practical implication of noncompliance with theoretical CS hypothesis? Unlike in other underdetermined problems that assume random down-projections, the low-resolution image formation model employed in CS-based SR is a deterministic down-projection that may not necessarily satisfy some critical assumptions of CS. We further investigate the impact of such projections in concern to the above questions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6193248/06111276.pdf","startPage":"778","endPage":"789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2180773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2180773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6193248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding Compressive Sensing and Sparse Representation-Based Super-Resolution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Strontium","Coherence","Image reconstruction","Image resolution","Atomic measurements","Imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image representation","image resolution","inverse problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","sparse representation-based super-resolution","CS paradigm","single image super-resolution","SR problem","sparse representation-based inverse problem","redundant dictionary basis","low-resolution image formation model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","Grammian measures","redundant dictionary","sparse representation","super-resolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Understanding Compressive Sensing and Sparse Representation-Based Super-Resolution","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6111276/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12695202","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding Compressive Sensing and Sparse Representation-Based Super-Resolution","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-li-2180773-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111367S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6193248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6193248","articleId":"6111276","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6111277,"authors":[{"name":"Shyong Jian Shyu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Ming Chuan University, Gueishan, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6193248/6111277/6111277-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shyong Jian Shyu received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1985, the M.S. degree in computer and decision sciences in 1987, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science in 1991 from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu.","From 1991 to 1993, he was with the National Defense Management College, Jhonghe, Taiwan.

The linear autoregressive parametric model and kernel regressive nonparametric models are used to explore the interscale and intrascale dependencies of the image, respectively.

With the nonzero pulsating-dc output, the proposed ZCS scheme is effective even without an active-clamp circuit, and it is suitable for applications where low-voltage dc to high-voltage three-phase ac power conversion is required.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2181130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2181130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6230687","startPage":"4537","endPage":"4544","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6230687/06111288.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111288","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Zero current switching","Bridge circuits","Digital video broadcasting","Modulation","Zero voltage switching","Discrete wavelet transforms","Power conversion","Zero current switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-AC power convertors","DC-DC power convertors","linear programming","zero current switching","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["loss-mitigating scheme","DC/pulsating-DC converter","high-frequency-link system","soft-switching scheme","zero-current-switching","front-end isolated dc/pulsating-dc converter","three-phase rectifier-type high-frequency-link power converter","linear programming","back-end ac/ac converter","patent-filed hybrid modulation scheme","zero-voltage-switching","secondary-side rectifier","active-clamp circuit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-frequency link","isolated three-phase converter","power conversion","pulsating-dc","zero-current switching (ZCS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Loss-Mitigating Scheme for DC/Pulsating-DC Converter of a High-Frequency-Link System","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"12834263","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6111288/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111288/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Loss-Mitigating Scheme for DC/Pulsating-DC Converter of a High-Frequency-Link System","sourcePdf":"tie-mazumder-2181130-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050063S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6230687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6230687","articleId":"6111288","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6111289,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Nai Fovino","affiliation":["Joint Research Centre, European Commission, Brussels, Belgium"],"bio":{"p":["Igor Nai Fovino received the Ph.D. degree in computer science in March 2006.","He is the Head of the Research Department of the Global Cyber Security Center, Rome, Italy.

The passive axial/tilting magnetic bearing supplies an axial position stiffness to stabilize the rotor in the axial direction and a tilting stiffness to restrain the rotor when subjected to gyroscopic torque. The active two-axis radial magnetic bearing with bias permanent magnet stabilizes the rotor on the axes perpendicular to the rotation axis. Considering the complex distribution of flux density the system performance cannot be accurately analyzed by the conventional magnetic circuit method because of the high coupling between force and moment produced by the axial magnetic axial/tilting bearing and RMB. To analyze the coupling problem of the force, moment, position stiffness, and tilting stiffness between the passive magnetic axial/tilting bearing and RMB, an integral design and analysis method based on three-dimensional finite-element method is presented. An example is given and analysis results prove that the high coupling occurs on the radial direction and the light occurs on the axial and tilting directions orthogonal to the spin axis. Then the linearized model is given in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6202766/06111297.pdf","startPage":"1959","endPage":"1966","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2180731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2180731","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6202766","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integral Design and Analysis of Passive Magnetic Bearing and Active Radial Magnetic Bearing for Agile Satellite Application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic levitation","Rotors","Force","Magnetic flux","Soft magnetic materials","Stators","Permanent magnets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace engineering","artificial satellites","design engineering","finite element analysis","force","gyroscopes","magnetic bearings","mechanical stability","rotors","wheels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive magnetic bearing","active two-axial radial magnetic bearing","agile satellite application","magnetic bearing design","magnetic bearing analysis","axial bearing","tilting bearing","magnetically suspended wheel","magnetically suspended control moment gyroscope","axial position stiffness","rotor stability","tilting stiffness","gyroscopic torque","bias permanent magnet","rotation axis","flux density distribution","force","moment","coupling problem","integral design method","integral analysis method","three-dimensional finite-element method","3D finite element method","axial direction","tilting direction","linearized model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Magnetically suspended control moment gyroscope","passive magnetic bearing","radial magnetic bearing","three-dimensional (3-D) finite-element method (FEM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111297/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Integral Design and Analysis of Passive Magnetic Bearing and Active Radial Magnetic Bearing for Agile Satellite Application","volume":"48","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6111297/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12850555","dateOfInsertion":"18 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integral Design and Analysis of Passive Magnetic Bearing and Active Radial Magnetic Bearing for Agile Satellite Application","sourcePdf":"tmag-bangcheng-2180731-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127771S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6202766","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6202766","articleId":"6111297","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6111304,"authors":[{"name":"Xinsong Yang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Honghe University, Mengzi, Yunnan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6119090/6111304/6111304-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinsong Yang received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Huaihua Normal University, Hunan, China, in 1992, and the M.S. degree in mathematics from Yunnan University, Kunming, China, in 2006.","He was a Visiting Scholar with the Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, from 2008 to 2009.

In the process of evolution, the proposed model switches from one mode to another according to a Markovian chain, and all the modes have different constant time-delays. The coupling strengths are characterized by mutually independent random variables. When compared with most of existing dynamical network models which share common time-delay for all modes and have constant coupling strengths, our model is more practical because different chaotic neural network models can have different time-delays and coupling strength of complex networks may randomly vary around a constant due to environmental and artificial factors. By designing a novel Lyapunov functional and using some inequalities and the properties of random variables, we derive several new sufficient synchronization criteria formulated by linear matrix inequalities.

We examine robust sum mean-square-error (MSE) minimization problems. The problems are examined for the generalized scenario where the power constraint is per BS, per BS antenna, per user or per symbol, and the noise vector of each MS is a zero-mean circularly symmetric complex Gaussian random variable with arbitrary covariance matrix. For each of these problems, we propose a novel duality based iterative solution. Each of these problems is solved as follows. First, we establish a novel sum average mean-square-error (AMSE) duality. Second, we formulate the power allocation part of the problem in the downlink channel as a Geometric Program (GP). Third, using the duality result and the solution of GP, we utilize alternating optimization technique to solve the original downlink problem. To solve robust sum MSE minimization constrained with per BS antenna and per BS power problems, we have established novel downlink-uplink duality. On the other hand, to solve robust sum MSE minimization constrained with per user and per symbol power problems, we have established novel downlink-interference duality. For the total BS power constrained robust sum MSE minimization problem, the current duality is established by modifying the constraint function of the dual uplink channel problem. And, for the robust sum MSE minimization with per BS antenna and per user (symbol) power constraint problems, our duality are established by formulating the noise covariance matrices of the uplink and interference channels as fixed point functions, respectively. We also show that our sum AMSE duality are able to solve other sum MSE-based robust design problems.

In this paper, we propose a resource allocation (RA) algorithm to perform uplink frequency allocation and power allocation among noncooperative multicells with multiuser per cell in CR systems. The maximization of the total information rate of multiple users in one cell is considered for the Rayleigh channel with path loss subject to the power constraint on each user. Since the optimization formulation for rate maximization of multiple users in each cell is an integer optimization problem, the multiple access channel (MAC) technique is proposed. With the aid of MAC, the original integer optimization problem is transformed into a concave optimization problem, thereby establishing a distributed game model in which the base station of each cell, which tries to maximize the sum rate of its own users, is a player. The proposed game-theoretic algorithm for distributed multiuser power allocation is viewed as an extension of the iterative water-filling algorithm, which is applied to distributed single-user power allocation. From the perspective of effectiveness, the proposed game-theoretic algorithm based on the MAC technique is compared with the traditional algorithm based on frequency-division multiplexing access (FDMA). Final numerical results show that the MAC-based RA algorithm can achieve more information rate and better convergence performance than the FDMA-based RA algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2180743","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6151237/06111326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2180743","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151237","startPage":"799","endPage":"811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncooperative Multicell Resource Allocation of FBMC-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Noncooperative Multicell Resource Allocation of FBMC-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111326/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12527206","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6111326/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncooperative Multicell Resource Allocation of FBMC-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2180743-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126407S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6151237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6151237","articleId":"6111326","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6111327,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Zhang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China","Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/6155149/6111327/6111327-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yun Zhang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Ningbo University, Ningbo, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China, in 2010.

However, these two technologies increase the computational complexity of MVC encoders tremendously. In this paper, we propose an efficient Statistical DIRECT Mode Early Termination (SDMET) model which estimates the rate distortion degradation, false acceptance rate and false reject rate of early DIRECT mode decision. It can adaptively adjust the rate distortion cost threshold not only according to the quantization parameter, but also the video content and motion properties. Experimental results show that SDMET can reduce 42.40% to 65.60% computation complexity for fast mode decision. When it is jointly optimized with fast multi-reference frame selection, the proposed overall algorithm can achieve 79.57% to 89.21% computational complexity reduction with unnoticeable rate distortion degradation. Additionally, the proposed SDMET and the overall fast mode decision algorithm can be applied to both temporal views and inter-view views in MVC.","doi":"10.1109/TBC.2011.2174282","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel5/11/6155149/06111327.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2011.2174282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155149","startPage":"10","endPage":"23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Early Termination Model for Fast Mode Decision and Reference Frame Selection in Multiview Video Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111327","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Early Termination Model for Fast Mode Decision and Reference Frame Selection in Multiview Video Coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111327/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12543152","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6111327/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Early Termination Model for Fast Mode Decision and Reference Frame Selection in Multiview Video Coding","sourcePdf":"tbc-kwong-2174282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087266S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"6155149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6155149","articleId":"6111327","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6111332,"authors":[{"name":"Mert Korkali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Mert Korkal\u0131 (S'06-GS'09) received the B.S. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering and in industrial engineering from Bah\u00e7e\u015fehir \u00dcniversitesi, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2008, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Northeastern University, Boston, MA, in 2010.

The proposed methodology involves an online and an offline stage. The online stage is based solely on the utilization of the time-of-arrival (ToA) measurements of traveling waves propagating from the fault-occurrence point to synchronized wide-area monitoring devices installed at strategically selected substations. The captured waveforms are processed together at the time of fault in order to identify the location of the fault under study. The overall performance of the developed technique is demonstrated using Alternative Transients Program (ATP) simulations of fault transients and postprocessing the faulted waveform data via discrete wavelet transform. The applicability of the algorithm is independent of the fault type and can readily be extended to transmission grids of any size.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6186889/06111332.pdf","startPage":"1003","endPage":"1011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2176351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2176351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6186889","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traveling-Wave-Based Fault-Location Technique for Transmission Grids Via Wide-Area Synchronized Voltage Measurements","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission line measurements","Power transmission lines","Synchronization","Fault location","Sensors","Transient analysis","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","fault location","power grids","power system measurement","power system transients","power transmission faults","substations","voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traveling-wave-based fault-location technique","wide-area synchronized voltage measurement","power transmission grids","time-of-arrival measurement","ToA measurement","traveling wave propagation","fault-occurrence point","synchronized wide-area monitoring device installation","substation","alternative transient program simulation","ATP simulation","fault transient","faulted waveform data postprocessing","discrete wavelet transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transform","electromagnetic transient analysis","fault location","transmission grids","traveling waves","wide-area synchronized measurements"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111332/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"21 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Traveling-Wave-Based Fault-Location Technique for Transmission Grids Via Wide-Area Synchronized Voltage Measurements","volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6111332/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12692036","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traveling-Wave-Based Fault-Location Technique for Transmission Grids Via Wide-Area Synchronized Voltage Measurements","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-abur-2176351-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076089S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6186889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"6186889","articleId":"6111332","onlineDate":"21 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6111347,"authors":[{"name":"Kwan-Liu Ma","affiliation":["Computer science, University of California Davis, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Kwan-Liu Ma is a professor of computer science at the University of California, Davis, and is on the IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications editorial board.

Specifically, we are interested in developing new bounds on the achievable rates for sparse channels with long memory. We obtain a lower bound which can be achieved by practical receivers, based on MMSE channel shortening and suboptimal symbol detection for a reduced-state channel. An upper bound is given in the form of a semi-analytical solution derived using basic information theoretic inequalities, by a grouping of the channel taps into several clusters resulting in a newly defined single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channel. We show that the so obtained time-dispersive SIMO channel can be represented by an equivalent single-input single-output (SISO) channel with a significantly shorter channel memory. The reduced computational complexity allows the use of the BCJR algorithm for the newly defined channel. The proposed bounds are illustrated through several sparse channel examples and i.u.d. input symbols, showing that the upper bound significantly outperforms existing bounds. Performance of our lower bound strongly depends on the channel structure, showing best results for minimum-phase and maximum-phase systems.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.120611.100435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.120611.100435","startPage":"3343","endPage":"3352","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6110251/06111402.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6110251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounds on the Information Rate for Sparse Channels with Long Memory and i.u.d.

In the experiments, the power penalty of the wavelength converted output was improved using negative phase offset due to the suppression of double pulse and reduction of zero level power, and the transmission characteristics were improved using negative detuning of a BPF because of the elimination of the degraded components in the output signal. Moreover, the power penalty was optimized using a -0.12\u00a0rad phase offset and -0.15\u00a0nm BPF detuning at a bit rate of 10 Gb/s. We also investigated its effect via simulations by solving rate equations. The waveform and Q-factor of the wavelength converted signal were in good qualitative agreement with the experimental results. We studied the principle of the impact of both phase offset and BPF detuning on output signal improvement by a comparison of the optical spectrum of the wavelength converted output with that of the return-to-zero signal. Waveform improvement can be achieved by positioning the intensity of the two sidebands symmetrically on both sides of the carrier.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6111423/","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12506078","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"48","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improvement in the Performance of a Semiconductor Optical Amplifier Based Delayed Interference Signal-Wavelength Converter With Phase Offset of a Mach-Zehnder Delay Interferometer and BPF Detuning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement in the Performance of a Semiconductor Optical Amplifier Based Delayed Interference Signal-Wavelength Converter With Phase Offset of a Mach-Zehnder Delay Interferometer and BPF Detuning","sourcePdf":"jqe-uenohara-2181336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059914S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3","isNumber":"6141210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","xplore-issue":"6141210","articleId":"6111423","onlineDate":"22 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6111431,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyu Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoyu","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37399093800"},{"name":"David E.

Based on Lyapunov stability theory, a novel fault-diagnostic algorithm is proposed to estimate the actuator fault, which removes the classical assumption that the time derivative of the output errors should be known as in some existing work. Further, a novel fault-estimation observer is designed. Utilizing the estimated actuator fault, an accommodation scheme is proposed to compensate for the effect of the fault. In addition, a sufficient condition for the existence of SMOs is derived according to Lyapunov stability theory.

In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient approach based on adaptive step-size least mean squares (AS-LMS) adaptive filter for reducing MA in corrupted PPG signals. The presented method is an extension to our prior work on efficient use of adaptive filters for reduction of MA in PPG signals. The novelty of the method lies in the fact that a synthetic noise reference signal for an adaptive filtering process, representing MA noise, is generated internally from the MA-corrupted PPG signal itself instead of using any additional hardware such as accelerometer or source-detector pair for acquiring noise reference signal. Thus, the generated noise reference signal is then applied to the AS-LMS adaptive filter for artifact removal. While experimental results proved the efficacy of the proposed scheme, the merit of the method is clearly demonstrated using convergence and correlation analysis, thus making it best suitable for present-day pulse oximeters utilizing PPG sensor head with a single pair of source and detector, which does not have any extra hardware meant for capturing noise reference signal. In addition to arterial oxygen saturation estimation, the artifact reduction method facilitated the waveform contour analysis on artifact-reduced PPG, and the conventional parameters were evaluated for assessing the arterial stiffness.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2175832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6178360/06111474.pdf","startPage":"1445","endPage":"1457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6178360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2175832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach for Motion Artifact Reduction in PPG Signals Based on AS-LMS Adaptive Filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach for Motion Artifact Reduction in PPG Signals Based on AS-LMS Adaptive Filter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111474/","publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12639176","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6111474/","volume":"61","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach for Motion Artifact Reduction in PPG Signals Based on AS-LMS Adaptive Filter","sourcePdf":"tim-reddy-2175832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112283S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6178360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"190","xplore-issue":"6178360","articleId":"6111474","onlineDate":"22 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6111476,"authors":[{"name":"Nikos Deligiannis","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Institute for Broadband Technology, Ghent, Belgium","Department of Electronics and Informatics, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6170603/6111476/6111476-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nikos Deligiannis (S'08\u2013M'10) received the M.Eng. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Patras, Patras, Greece, in 2006.

This paper builds on a concept of correlation channel (CC) modeling, which expresses the correlation noise as being statistically dependent on the side information (SI). Compared with classical side-information-independent (SII) noise modeling adopted in current DVC solutions, it is theoretically proven that side-information-dependent (SID) modeling improves the Wyner-Ziv coding performance. Anchored in this finding, this paper proposes a novel algorithm for online estimation of the SID CC parameters based on already decoded information. The proposed algorithm enables bit-plane-by-bit-plane successive refinement of the channel estimation leading to progressively improved accuracy. Additionally, the proposed algorithm is included in a novel DVC architecture that employs a competitive hash-based motion estimation technique to generate high-quality SI at the decoder. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical gains and validate the accuracy of the channel estimation algorithm. The performance assessment of the proposed architecture shows remarkable and consistent coding gains over a germane group of state-of-the-art distributed and standard video codecs, even under

new method for classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. The intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) generated by EMD method can be considered as a set of amplitude and frequency modulated (AM-FM) signals. The Hilbert transformation of IMFs provides an analytic signal representation of the IMFs. The two bandwidths, namely amplitude modulation bandwidth (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">AM</sub>\n) and frequency modulation bandwidth (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FM</sub>\n), computed from the analytic IMFs, have been used as an input to least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) for classifying seizure and nonseizure EEG signals.

procedures for treatment of atrial fibrillation (AFib). As these overlay images are often compromised by cardiac and respiratory motion, motion compensation methods are needed to keep the overlay images in sync with the fluoroscopic images. So far, these approaches have either required simultaneous biplane imaging for 3-D motion compensation, or in case of monoplane X-ray imaging, provided only a limited 2-D functionality. To overcome the downsides of the previously suggested methods, we propose an approach that facilitates a full 3-D motion compensation even if only monoplane X-ray images are available. To this end, we use a training phase that employs a biplane sequence to establish a patient specific motion model. Afterwards, a constrained model-based 2-D/3-D registration method is used to track a circumferential mapping catheter. This device is commonly used for AFib catheter ablation procedures. Based on the experiments on real patient data, we found that our constrained monoplane 2-D/3-D registration outperformed the unconstrained counterpart and yielded an average 2-D tracking error of 0.6 mm and an average 3-D tracking error of 1.6 mm. The unconstrained 2-D/3-D registration technique yielded a similar 2-D performance, but the 3-D tracking error increased to 3.2 mm mostly due to wrongly estimated 3-D motion components in X-ray view direction. Compared to the conventional 2-D monoplane method, the proposed method provides a more seamless workflow by removing the need for catheter model re-initialization otherwise required when the C-arm view orientation changes. In addition, the proposed method can be straightforwardly combined with the previously introduced biplane motion compensation technique to obtain a good trade-off between accuracy and radiation dose reduction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained Registration for Motion Compensation in Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Procedures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2011.2181184","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/6177255/06111483.pdf","startPage":"870","endPage":"881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2011.2181184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6177255","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111483","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111483/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"Constrained Registration for Motion Compensation in Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Procedures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6111483/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12638447","pubMedId":"22203705","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained Registration for Motion Compensation in Atrial Fibrillation Ablation Procedures","sourcePdf":"tmi-brost-2181184-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110876S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6177255","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6177255","articleId":"6111483","onlineDate":"22 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6111489,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Corradini","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6177741/6111489/6111489-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luca Corradini (S\u201906\u2013M\u201909) received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in industrial electronics from the University of Padova, Padova, Italy, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","From 2008 to 2011, he was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Colorado Power Electronics Center (CoPEC), University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder.

The analysis, developed here for the most general case of three independent phase-shift control angles, demonstrates the existence of minimum current trajectories in the 3-D control space along which the DBSRC cell can deliver any admissible power level with minimum tank circulating current. At nonunity conversion ratios, minimum current operation prevents the DBSRC output bridge from experiencing severe hard-switching losses, substantially reducing the effort normally required by auxiliary zero-voltage switching assistance circuitry, and outperforming the efficiency of conventional one-angle modulation approaches especially at light load. The developed approach is validated via computer simulations and experimental tests on a 1-kW DBSRC prototype. Tests performed at a nonunity voltage conversion ratio indicate a marked light-load efficiency improvement with respect to the conventional one-angle modulation, confirming the importance of the minimum current operation when the converter is expected to operate with programmable output voltages or under wide input voltage variations.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2181421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2181421","startPage":"3266","endPage":"3276","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6177741/06111489.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6177741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum Current Operation of Bidirectional Dual-Bridge Series Resonant DC/DC Converters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","displayDocTitle":"Minimum Current Operation of Bidirectional Dual-Bridge Series Resonant DC/DC Converters","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","volume":"27","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6111489/","accessionNumber":"12638750","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111489/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum Current Operation of Bidirectional Dual-Bridge Series Resonant DC/DC Converters","sourcePdf":"tpel-corradini-2181421-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084446S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6177741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"144","xplore-issue":"6177741","articleId":"6111489","onlineDate":"22 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6111495,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Cheng Tu","affiliation":["Interdigital Canada Lt\u00e9e, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6151237/6111495/6111495-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao-Cheng Tu received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada, in 2010.","After the two-year obligatory military service in Taiwan, he was with ACER Communications and Multimedia Inc. as a Hardware Research and Development Engineer.

Subspace-based tracking is normally considered for slowly time-varying channels only. Due to the frequency correlation of the wireless channels, the proposed scheme can collect data not only from the time but from the frequency domain as well to speed up the update of the required second-order statistics. After each such update, the subspace information is recomputed using the orthogonal iteration, and then, a new channel estimate is obtained. We also investigate choices of precoder in terms of the tradeoff between the symbol recovery capability and the channel estimation performance and demonstrate the convergence properties of our approach. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in a Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Spatial Channel Model suburban macro scenario, in which a mobile station is allowed to move in any direction with a speed up to 100 km/h, corresponding to a maximum Doppler shift of about 230 Hz in this case. Numerical experiments show that the normalized mean square error of the channel estimates converges to a level of -30 dB within less than five OFDM symbols when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (per symbol) is \u2265 20 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2181436","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6151237/06111495.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2181436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151237","startPage":"662","endPage":"674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Recursive Subspace-Based Identification of Time-Varying Wideband MIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind Recursive Subspace-Based Identification of Time-Varying Wideband MIMO Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111495/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12527208","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6111495/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Recursive Subspace-Based Identification of Time-Varying Wideband MIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-tu-2181436-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101848S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6151237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6151237","articleId":"6111495","onlineDate":"22 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6111496,"authors":[{"name":"Thierry Castermans","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Mons, Mons, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6134620/6111496/6111496-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thierry Castermans received the M.S. degree in physics from the University of Mons, Mons, Belgium, in 2000, the M.S. degree in astrophysics from the University of Li\u00e8ge, Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, in 2002, and the Ph.D. degree in physics from the University of Mons, in 2008.","He is currently a postdoctoral researcher at TCTS lab (circuit theory and signal processing), University of Mons.

This technology provides severely disabled people with an alternative mean to communicate or control any electric device. On the other hand, BCI applications are more and more dedicated to healthier people, with the aim of giving them access to augmented reality or new rehabilitation tools. As it is noninvasive, light and relatively cheap, electroencephalography (EEG) is the most used acquisition technique to record cerebral activity of the BCI users. However, when using such type of BCI, user movements are likely to provoke motions of the measuring electrodes which can severely damage the EEG quality. Thus, current BCI technology requires that the user sits and performs as little movements as possible. This is of course a strong limitation of BCI for use in ordinary life. Very recently, preliminary studies have been published in the literature and suggest that BCI applications can be realized even in the physically moving context. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the possibility to develop a P300-based BCI system in ambulatory condition. The study is based on experimental data recorded with seven subjects executing a visual P300 speller-like discrimination task while simultaneously walking at different speeds on a treadmill. It is demonstrated that a P300-based BCI is definitely feasible in such conditions. Different artifact correction methods are described and discussed in detail. To conclude, a recommended approach is given for the development of a real-time application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing the Performances of a P300-Based Brain\u2013Computer Interface in Ambulatory Conditions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2179421","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6134620/06111496.pdf","startPage":"566","endPage":"577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2179421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6134620","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111496/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing the Performances of a P300-Based Brain\u2013Computer Interface in Ambulatory Conditions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6111496/","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12494204","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing the Performances of a P300-Based Brain\u2013Computer Interface in Ambulatory Conditions","sourcePdf":"jetcas-castermans-2179421-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116605S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6134620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6134620","articleId":"6111496","onlineDate":"22 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6111498,"authors":[{"name":"Vikram Chaturvedi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6134620/6111498/6111498-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vikram Chaturvedi (S'10) received the B.E degree in electronics and telecommunication from S.G.S.I.T.S, Indore, India, in 2006.

The advent of multichannel micro-electrode arrays has driven the need for electronics to record neural signals from many neurons. The dynamic range of the system can vary over time due to change in electrode-neuron distance and background noise. We propose a neural amplifier in UMC 130 nm, 1P8M complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. It can be biased adaptively from 200 nA to 2 \u03bcA, modulating input referred noise from 9.92 \u03bcV to 3.9 \u03bcV. We also describe a low noise design technique which minimizes the noise contribution of the load circuitry. Optimum sizing of the input transistors minimizes the accentuation of the input referred noise of the amplifier and obviates the need of large input capacitance. The amplifier achieves a noise efficiency factor of 2.58. The amplifier can pass signal from 5 Hz to 7 kHz and the bandwidth of the amplifier can be tuned for rejecting low field potentials (LFP) and power line interference. The amplifier achieves a mid-band voltage gain of 37 dB. In vitro experiments are performed to validate the applicability of the neural low noise amplifier in neural recording systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6134620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2178731","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503868/6134620/06111498.pdf","startPage":"536","endPage":"545","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2011.2178731","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Area-Efficient Noise-Adaptive Neural Amplifier in 130 nm CMOS Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"An Area-Efficient Noise-Adaptive Neural Amplifier in 130 nm CMOS Technology","volume":"1","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6111498/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12494206","dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111498/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Area-Efficient Noise-Adaptive Neural Amplifier in 130 nm CMOS Technology","sourcePdf":"jetcas-chaturvedi-2178731-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075131S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6134620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6134620","articleId":"6111498","onlineDate":"22 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6111680,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Fida","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (SEECS), National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Syed","lastName":"Fida","id":"38234612800"},{"name":"Umar Kalim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (SEECS), National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Umar","lastName":"Kalim","id":"37564949200"},{"name":"Noman Latif","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (SEECS), National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Noman","lastName":"Latif","id":"38232459900"},{"name":"Syed Ali Khayam","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (SEECS), National University of Science and Technology, Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Syed Ali","lastName":"Khayam","id":"38533306800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0402-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0401-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0400-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6111680","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Detectors","Delay","Accuracy","Internet","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","decision theory","Internet","statistical distributions","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision theoretic approach","traffic anomaly detection","enterprise boundaries","enterprise networks","end-to-end Internet paths","noisy bandwidth measurement filtering","path bandwidth statistical distribution","baseline model"]}],"abstract":"Many algorithms have been proposed in the last decade to detect traffic anomalies in enterprise networks. However, most of these algorithms cannot detect anomalies that occur beyond enterprise boundaries. Anomaly monitoring and detection on end-to-end Internet paths, although important for network operations, is challenging due to lack of access and control over intermediate network devices. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that detects anomalies or significant events on an end-to-end Internet path by monitoring the path's available bandwidth. We first evaluate existing algorithms on a comprehensive dataset of more than a million bandwidth measurements spanning three years. We show that existing algorithms do not incorporate the typical behavior of a path in the anomaly detection process and consequently incur accuracy degradations. We therefore propose to filter noisy bandwidth measurements to extract a typical or baseline statistical distribution of a path's bandwidth. This baseline model is in turn leveraged in a generic decision-theoretic framework to provide timely detection of significant path events. We show that the proposed detector provides highly accurate performance and easily surpasses the accuracy of existing techniques.","doi":"10.1109/SafeConfig.2011.6111680","publicationTitle":"2011 4th Symposium on Configuration Analytics and Automation (SAFECONFIG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th Symposium on Configuration Analytics and Automation (SAFECONFIG)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6099688/6111661/06111680.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SafeConfig.2011.6111680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6111661","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision theoretic approach to detect anomalies beyond enterprise boundaries","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111680","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Decision theoretic approach to detect anomalies beyond enterprise boundaries","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 31 2011-Nov. 1 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111680/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 Oct.-1 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12443696","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6111680/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision theoretic approach to detect anomalies beyond enterprise boundaries","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"decisiontheoreticgillani2149365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091757S","chronDate":"Oct. 31 2011-Nov. 1 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6099688","isNumber":"6111661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6099688","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6111661","articleId":"6111680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6111702,"authors":[{"name":"Nachiketa Das","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Nachiketa","lastName":"Das","id":"38093244000"},{"name":"Pranab Roy","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Pranab","lastName":"Roy","id":"37958578500"},{"name":"Hafizur Rahaman","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Hafizur","lastName":"Rahaman","id":"37284440200"},{"name":"Parthasarathi Dasgupta","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, India"],"firstName":"Parthasarathi","lastName":"Dasgupta","id":"37288667500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0144-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0145-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0143-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6111702","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":450},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111702","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","Multiplexing","Built-in self-test","Flip-flops"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","automatic test equipment","automatic test pattern generation","built-in self test","embedded systems","fault diagnosis","field programmable gate arrays","high-speed integrated circuits","logic testing","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["build-in-self-test","delay fault diagnosis","reconfigurable hardware","convergence","hardware platform","embedded system","manufacturer oriented testing","delay testing","high-speed circuits","critical path","automatic test equipment","delay fault detection","BIST structure","off-line testing","testing efficiency","TPG","ORA","BUT","Xilinx Vertex-II FPGA","ISE tool Jbits3.0 API","XHWI","Xilinx hardware interface","MATLAB7.0"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Delay fault","JBits","testing","TPG","ORA","BUT","XHWI"]}],"abstract":"The recent trend of reconfigurable hardware and convergence of hardware platform in embedded system have enhanced the application of FPGAs. Although the capability and performance of FPGA have advanced, the testing of FPGAs both online and off-line (manufacturer oriented testing) poses a major challenge. Importance of delay testing has grown especially for high-speed circuits. Even presence of small delay fault may cause any critical path to fail. As delay testing, using automatic test equipment is found to be quite expensive; BIST (Built-In-Self-Test) can significantly reduce the cost of delay fault detection without using extra hardware. We have presented a BIST structure to test delay fault of various resources and interconnects of FPGA. The proposed scheme can be implemented for both online as well as off-line testing. We have also proposed a new 3-diagnosable BISTer structure that improves the testing efficiency of our BISTer. The proposed technique can detect the presence of fault, even if all the three units ( TPG, ORA, BUT) in a BIST are faulty.

The data stability issue becomes more severe with increasing variability and decreasing supply voltage in scaled CMOS technologies. Conventional techniques to enhance the data stability of 6T memory cells tend to sacrifice other important figures of merit, such as memory integration density and write ability. 6T SRAM circuits with higher data stability are presented in this paper. An electrical performance metric is evaluated to compare various memory design options targeting different applications. The overall electrical quality is enhanced without increasing the area with a multi-threshold-voltage CMOS technology. A high-threshold-voltage 6T memory cell is recommended for portable devices where lower energy consumption and longer battery lifetime are critically important. Alternatively, a triple-threshold-voltage 6T SRAM cell is recommended for robust memory operation in applications with aggressive speed requirement.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111704/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6111704/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12444263","conferenceDate":"19-20 July 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Application-specific selection of 6T SRAM cells offering superior performance and quality with a triple-threshold-voltage CMOS technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application-specific selection of 6T SRAM cells offering superior performance and quality with a triple-threshold-voltage CMOS technology","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"2A1070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062247S","chronDate":"19-20 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6104280","isNumber":"6111683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6104280","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6111683","articleId":"6111704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6111707,"authors":[{"name":"Pranab Roy","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Pranab","lastName":"Roy","id":"37958578500"},{"name":"Hafizur Rahaman","affiliation":["School of VLSI Technology, Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur, India"],"firstName":"Hafizur","lastName":"Rahaman","id":"37284440200"},{"name":"Parthasarathi Dasgupta","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, India"],"firstName":"Parthasarathi","lastName":"Dasgupta","id":"37288667500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0144-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0145-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0143-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6111707","dbTime":"40 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Microfluidics","Mixers","Electrodes","Compaction","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioMEMS","DNA","lab-on-a-chip","microfluidics","network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["routing-aware placement","intelligent collision avoidance","digital microfluidic biochips","microfabrication technology","lab-on-chip systems","miniaturized microsystem","clinical diagnostics","DNA sequencing","drug discovery","biochemical analyses","CAD problem","Benchmark suite III","multipin droplets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Placement","droplet Routing","Digital micro fluidics","Algorithms"]}],"abstract":"The current advancement in microfluidics and microfabrication technology makes it possible to realize true multifunctional lab-on-chip systems that can replace a real life laboratory system with a miniaturized microsystem. The huge advantages of such systems are that they enable fast, easy-to-use, cost-effective detection methods which find major application in the areas of clinical diagnostics, DNA sequencing, drug discovery and other biochemical analyses and applications. As the design of droplet based microfluidic biochips tends to incorporate concurrent execution of multiple bioassays in a single chip, the design complexity as well as system integration issues begin to pose major challenges. A potential CAD problem in this context is the concurrent routing of droplets in DMFBs. This has direct impact on overall reaction time as well as cell usage and pin requirements (specifically in direct-addressing biochips). In this paper we propose a routing-aware placement algorithm for droplets in a digital microfluidic system with a given prescheduled module arrangement. The objective is to enhance the routing process by intelligent collision avoidance, optimized stalling and detour, which finally results in stark improvement in latest arrival time and resource utilization. The proposed algorithm is tested on benchmark suite I for 2-pin droplets and Benchmark suite III for multipin droplets. The results obtained are quite encouraging.","doi":"10.1109/ASQED.2011.6111707","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104280/6111683/06111707.pdf","startPage":"85","endPage":"94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASQED.2011.6111707","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6111683","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing-aware placement technique for intelligent collision avoidance in digital microfluidic biochips","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111707","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111707/","displayDocTitle":"Routing-aware placement technique for intelligent collision avoidance in digital microfluidic biochips","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12444266","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6111707/","conferenceDate":"19-20 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Routing-aware placement technique for intelligent collision avoidance in digital microfluidic biochips","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"2B1097.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109348S","chronDate":"19-20 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6104280","isNumber":"6111683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6104280","xplore-issue":"6111683","articleId":"6111707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6111738,"authors":[{"name":"Anshul Singh","affiliation":["CVEST, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Anshul","lastName":"Singh","id":"37401947500"},{"name":"Satyam Mandavalli","affiliation":["CVEST, International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Satyam","lastName":"Mandavalli","id":"37947010900"},{"name":"Vincent J.

For the diode-based predistortion technique, a new strategy is presented for selecting the breakpoints on a typical linearizer characteristic. Using this strategy, a new diode-based curve-fitting predistortion linearizer for GaN power amplifier is developed. The proposed linearizer is tested using the two-tone test. The experimental results show that a 3 dB improvement in the overall gain of the linearized amplifier is achieved. Moreover, for output power levels up to 36 dBm, the linearized power amplifier provides better rejection of the third-order intermodulation. Because of the hard nonlinearity of the GaN power amplifier at the high end, this improvement in intermodulation rejection vanishes for output power levels around 41 dBm. For the feedforward technique the simulation results show that the 1 dB compression point has been increased from the original 40 dBm for unlinearized amplifier to 43.74 dBm for the linearized one.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6111683","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASQED.2011.6111761","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104280/6111683/06111761.pdf","startPage":"282","endPage":"287","doi":"10.1109/ASQED.2011.6111761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linearization of GaN power amplifier using feedforward and predistortion techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Linearization of GaN power amplifier using feedforward and predistortion techniques","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-20 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6111761/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12444300","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111761/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linearization of GaN power amplifier using feedforward and predistortion techniques","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"4P3005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052551S","chronDate":"19-20 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6104280","isNumber":"6111683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6104280","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6111683","articleId":"6111761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6111762,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Taher Abuelma'atti","affiliation":["King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Muhammad Taher","lastName":"Abuelma'atti","id":"37282301700"},{"name":"Abdullah M.T.

A multi-stage parallel execution framework for such tasks is presented in this paper. To achieve fine grain parallelism, each task is conceptually decomposed into subtasks for SW processing and HW access, and similar subtasks of multiple tasks are parallelized independently. At SW level, multi-threading of SW processing jobs takes advantage of increasing availability of multi-core processors. Multi-FPGA parallelism is achieved for HW access, to harness independent processing capabilities of a design partition. At a single FPGA level, lazy access mechanism is introduced for parallel processing of multiple HW access tasks, using design specific signal dependency characteristics. The system has been implemented on an industry standard logic emulation system and benchmarks on real designs have shown significant gain in verification performance, while maintaining functional fidelity.","doi":"10.1109/ASQED.2011.6111765","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd Asia Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ASQED)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6104280/6111683/06111765.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASQED.2011.6111765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6111683","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6111765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-stage parallel processing of design element access tasks in FPGA-based logic emulation systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6111765/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-stage parallel processing of design element access tasks in FPGA-based logic emulation systems","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6111765/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","conferenceDate":"19-20 July 2011","accessionNumber":"12444304","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-stage parallel processing of design element access tasks in FPGA-based logic emulation systems","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"4P7024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074481S","chronDate":"19-20 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6104280","isNumber":"6111683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6104280","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6111683","articleId":"6111765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6112009,"authors":[{"name":"Carmen Voicu","affiliation":["Telecommunication Department, Electronics, Telecommunications & Information Technology Faculty, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Carmen","lastName":"Voicu","id":"38013702600"},{"name":"Simona Halunga","affiliation":["Telecommunication Department, Electronics, Telecommunications & Information Technology Faculty, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Simona","lastName":"Halunga","id":"37353700400"},{"name":"Dragos Vizireanu","affiliation":["Telecommunication Department, Electronics, Telecommunications & Information Technology Faculty, University Politehnica of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Dragos","lastName":"Vizireanu","id":"37348819200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2019-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2018-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2017-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6112009","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performances of conventional and MMSE detectors for image transmissions","abstract":"This paper presents the results obtained by using conventional and MMSE (minimum mean square error) multiuser detectors structures when gray images are transmitted through the system.

In order to test the performance of these schemes under various fading conditions, we use two generalized fading distributions, namely the a-\u03bc distribution and the K-\u03bc distribution. By adjusting the parameters a, k, and \u03bc, we simulate the conventional Rician, Rayleigh, and Nakagami-m fading cases. Further, to provide an example for cases where the field measurements may exhibit better fit to nonconventional distributions, we also study a heuristic fading scenario. Using QPSK modulation, we observe that binary and nonbinary LDPC-coded modulation schemes perform closely under all fading conditions considered. However, in terms of receiver latency, the nonbinary LDPC-coded modulation scheme may lower receiver latency especially when complex equalization schemes are employed since NB-LDPC-CM avoids using iterative equalization and decoding which is a crucial component in binary LDPC-coded modulation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TELSKS.2011.6112023","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Telecommunication in Modern Satellite Cable and Broadcasting Services (TELSIKS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Conference on Telecommunication in Modern Satellite Cable and Broadcasting Services (TELSIKS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6102682/6111770/06112023.pdf","startPage":"148","endPage":"151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TELSKS.2011.6112023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6111770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Binary and nonbinary LDPC-coded modulations for generalized fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Binary and nonbinary LDPC-coded modulations for generalized fading channels","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12444151","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6112023/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112023/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"5-8 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary and nonbinary LDPC-coded modulations for generalized fading channels","confLoc":"Nis, Serbia","sourcePdf":"26Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040359S","chronDate":"5-8 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6102682","isNumber":"6111770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6102682","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6111770","articleId":"6112023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6112025,"authors":[{"name":"Alina-Mihaela Badescu","affiliation":["POLITEHNICA University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Alina-Mihaela","lastName":"Badescu","id":"37680243100"},{"name":"Teodor Petrescu","affiliation":["POLITEHNICA University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Teodor","lastName":"Petrescu","id":"37449497500"},{"name":"Ioana Marcu","affiliation":["POLITEHNICA University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Ioana","lastName":"Marcu","id":"37546440400"},{"name":"Octavian Fratu","affiliation":["POLITEHNICA University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Octavian","lastName":"Fratu","id":"37345214000"},{"name":"Simona Halunga","affiliation":["POLITEHNICA University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Simona","lastName":"Halunga","id":"37353700400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2019-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2018-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-2017-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6112025","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dipole antennas","Permittivity","Receiving antennas","Phase shift keying","Dielectrics","Power transmission lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","code division multiple access","quadrature phase shift keying","underground communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronous underground CDMA system","underground propagation","QPSK modulated signal","antenna","transmission lines","drilled cavity","linear quantization"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the behavior of a CDMA system in conditions of underground propagation collaborated with QPSK modulated signals.

It is well known that the multiuser diversity can be beneficial but there is a significant cost in terms of system resources, bandwidth and power associated with acquiring instantaneous CSI. We work out a cost-benefit analysis of multiuser diversity for 2 types of CSI feedback methods, dedicated feedback and SNR dependent feedback, quantifying how many users should feedback CSI i.e the amount of available multiuser diversity that should be used from a net throughput perspective. Dedicated feedback, in which orthogonal resources are allocated to each user, has significant feedback cost and this limits the amount of available multiuser diversity that can be used. SNR dependent feedback method, in which only users with SNR above a threshold attempt to feedback, has relatively much smaller feedback cost and this allows for all of the available multiuser diversity to be used. Next, we study the effect of single user multiantenna techniques, which reduce the SNR variation, on the number of feedback users. It is seen that a broadcast channel using single user multiantenna techniques should reduce the number of feedback users with the spatial dimension.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.121911.102299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6135125/06112149.pdf","startPage":"408","endPage":"418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.121911.102299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6135125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Diversity in Downlink Channels: When Does the Feedback Cost Outweigh the Spectral Efficiency Benefit?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112149","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112149/","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Diversity in Downlink Channels: When Does the Feedback Cost Outweigh the Spectral Efficiency Benefit?","volume":"11","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2012","accessionNumber":"12487489","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6112149/","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Diversity in Downlink Channels: When Does the Feedback Cost Outweigh the Spectral Efficiency Benefit?","sourcePdf":"408-tw1201-rajanna.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093962S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6135125","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6135125","articleId":"6112149","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6112151,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Kai Wen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6150275/6112151/6112151-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chao-Kai Wen (S'00-M'04) received the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 2004.

In the selected scenario, the source, relay, and destination terminals are equipped with correlated antennas where a direct link between the source and the destination terminals can be found. Moreover, the statistical CSIT consists of the channel means and covariance matrices of various links. The design problem is taken into account for regimes in large systems because there are no closed-form expressions of the average mutual information in the MIMO relay channel. The contribution of this study includes the derivation of asymptotic mutual information expressions for the MIMO relay channel in the large system limit. Additionally, an efficient optimization algorithm based on the asymptotic mutual information is proposed in order to find the asymptotically optimal source covariance matrix and the relay amplifying matrix. Numerical simulation results show that the new approach achieves indistinguishable performance compared to those of the maximization approaches in finite-dimensional systems, even for a small number of antennas at each link. The impact of the CSI of various links on the throughput of the MIMO relay channel is studied using the new approach.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.121911.110193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06112151.pdf","startPage":"668","endPage":"682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.121911.110193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Transmitter Design for Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Systems Exploiting Only Channel Statistics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112151/","displayDocTitle":"Robust Transmitter Design for Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Systems Exploiting Only Channel Statistics","volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537074","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6112151/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Transmitter Design for Amplify-and-Forward MIMO Relay Systems Exploiting Only Channel Statistics","sourcePdf":"668-tw1202-wen.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17958S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6112151","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6112152,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo Song","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Shuo","lastName":"Song","id":"37533450700"},{"name":"John S.

The proposed iterative algorithm employs two schemes to speed up the convergence process, which exploit negative feedback information in a single time slot (Scheme 1) and in successive time slots (Scheme 2) respectively, whereas previously proposed algorithms in the literature discard this information. We show that the proposed algorithm yields a significant improvement in the convergence speed compared to the original algorithm. Furthermore, we modify the proposed algorithm to be capable of tracking time-varying channels which have variable rates of phase drift. The modified hybrid algorithm has the ability to adjust perturbation sizes adaptively without the knowledge of channel state information and is suited for practical implementations.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.121911.110427","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06112152.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.121911.110427","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"516","endPage":"525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Negative Feedback Information for One-Bit Feedback Beamforming Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112152","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Negative Feedback Information for One-Bit Feedback Beamforming Algorithm","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112152/","volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6112152/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537075","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Negative Feedback Information for One-Bit Feedback Beamforming Algorithm","sourcePdf":"516-tw1202-song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090454S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6112152","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6112153,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Gazor","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6150275/6112153/6112153-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Saeed Gazor (S'94-M'95-SM'98) received the B.Sc. degree in Electronics Engineering in 1987 and the M.Sc. degree in Communication Systems Engineering in 1989, from Isfahan University of Technology, both with Summa Cum Laude, the highest honors.

Best-first detection based on Dijkstra's algorithm pursues tree search according to a sorted list of tree nodes. In the first part of the paper, a new probabilistic sorting scheme is developed and incorporated in a modified Dijkstra's algorithm for MIMO detection. The proposed sorting exploits the statistics of the problem and yields effective tree exploration and truncation in the proposed algorithm. The second part of the paper generalizes the results in the first part and removes some limitations. A generalized Dijkstra's algorithm is developed as a unified tree-search detection framework. The proposed framework incorporates a parameter triplet that allow the configuration of the memory usage, detection complexity, and sorting dynamic associated with the tree-search algorithm. By tuning different parameters, desired performance-complexity tradeoffs are attained and a fixed-complexity version can be produced. Simulation results and analytical discussions demonstrate that the proposed generalized Dijkstra's algorithm shows abilities to achieve highly favorable performance-complexity tradeoffs.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.121911.110568","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06112156.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.121911.110568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","startPage":"780","endPage":"789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Best-First Tree Search with Probabilistic Node Ordering for MIMO Detection: Generalization and Performance-Complexity Tradeoff","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Best-First Tree Search with Probabilistic Node Ordering for MIMO Detection: Generalization and Performance-Complexity Tradeoff","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112156/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537079","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6112156/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Best-First Tree Search with Probabilistic Node Ordering for MIMO Detection: Generalization and Performance-Complexity Tradeoff","sourcePdf":"780-tw1202-chang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086879S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6112156","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6112157,"authors":[{"name":"Fredrik Rusek","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6150275/6112157/6112157-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fredrik Rusek was born in Lund, Sweden in 1978.

This coordination and the required capabilities may not be available in some wireless systems where the nodes are equipped with very basic communication hardware. We consider a scenario where the source node transmits its signal to the destination through multiple relays in an uncoordinated fashion. The destination captures the multiple copies of the transmitted signal through a Rake receiver. We analyze a situation where the number of Rake fingers N is less than that of the relaying nodes L. In this case, the receiver can combine N strongest signals out of L. The remaining signals will be lost and act as interference to the desired signal components. To tackle this problem, we develop a novel signal combining technique based on channel shortening principles. This technique proposes a processing block before the Rake reception which compresses the energy of L signal components over N branches while keeping the noise level at its minimum. The proposed scheme saves the system resources and makes the received signal compatible to the available hardware. Simulation results show that it outperforms the selection combining scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.121911.101960","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06112158.pdf","startPage":"659","endPage":"667","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.121911.101960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Diversity Compression and Combining Technique Based on Channel Shortening for Cooperative Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112158/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Diversity Compression and Combining Technique Based on Channel Shortening for Cooperative Networks","volume":"11","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537081","publicationDate":"February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6112158/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Diversity Compression and Combining Technique Based on Channel Shortening for Cooperative Networks","sourcePdf":"659-tw1202-hussain.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102492S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6112158","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6112172,"authors":[{"name":"Uygar E.

In this case study, we propose a simulation-based methodology for the variability modeling, which is caused by line edge roughness in advanced technological nodes. The aim of this work is to present the approach by modeling the threshold voltage disturbance propagation mechanism in a raw memory array, caused by the variability-affected parasitic coupling. The variability aware model is statistically designed for evaluation of the cell-to-cell interference variability impact on disturbances of threshold voltage and the error generation in a 16-nm half-pitch NAND Flash memory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112176/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","volume":"33","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12489209","htmlLink":"/document/6112176/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Induced Variability of Cell-to-Cell Interference by Line Edge Roughness in nand Flash Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Induced Variability of Cell-to-Cell Interference by Line Edge Roughness in nand Flash Arrays","sourcePdf":"led-poliakov-2176099-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049463S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"55","isNumber":"6138595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"55","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6138595","articleId":"6112176","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6112178,"authors":[{"name":"Tsuyoshi Takahashi","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsuyoshi","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37277758900"},{"name":"Masaru Sato","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaru","lastName":"Sato","id":"37290041100"},{"name":"Yasuhiro Nakasha","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuhiro","lastName":"Nakasha","id":"37283934700"},{"name":"Tatsuya Hirose","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Hirose","id":"37267175800"},{"name":"Naoki Hara","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoki","lastName":"Hara","id":"37321156900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"6112178","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":428},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Cavity resonators","HEMTs","MODFETs","Noise","Parasitic capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high electron mobility transistors","indium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise figure improvement","HEMT","wide gate head","cavity structure","interconnection process","high-electron-mobility transistors","gate resistance","parasitic capacitance","passivated gate","frequency 94 GHz","noise figure 0.9 dB","InP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cavity","gate head","high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT)","noise figure"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112178","abstract":"The minimum noise figure (NF\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">min</sub>\n) at 94 GHz was improved effectively by employing a cavity structure in the interconnection process, even though a wide gate head was used in InP-based high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs).

However, adaptive beamforming methods, known for their high angular resolution and interference rejection capabilities, often rely on a Vandermonde structure of the steering vectors. This is generally not the case for nonlinear arrays. In this paper, we use an interpolated array transformation to map the data to a virtual linear array before adaptive beamforming. We evaluate the performance of two different adaptive beam- formers using simulations as well as experimental data from the SX90 fish finding sonar. We show that the adaptive minimum variance (MV) and amplitude and phase estimation of a sinusoid (APES) beamformers offer a significant improvement in azimuth resolution compared to the conventional delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer. The APES beamformer offers slightly more reliable amplitude estimates in the direction of interest compared to the MV beamformer, at the cost of a somewhat lower azimuth resolution. When applied to data from the SX90 fish finding sonar, the MV beamformer offers a 40%-50% improvement in resolution, while the APES beamformer offers an improvement of 20%-30%.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2011.2169611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126182","startPage":"25","endPage":"34","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/48/6126182/06112183.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Beamforming Applied to a Cylindrical Sonar Array Using an Interpolated Array Transformation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6112183/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Beamforming Applied to a Cylindrical Sonar Array Using an Interpolated Array Transformation","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471572","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"1","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Beamforming Applied to a Cylindrical Sonar Array Using an Interpolated Array Transformation","sourcePdf":"joe-blomberg-2169611-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065508S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"48","isNumber":"6126182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6126182","articleId":"6112183","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6112184,"authors":[{"name":"Qinwen Fan","affiliation":["Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6139293/6112184/6112184-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qinwen Fan (S'10) was born in Inner Mongolia, China.

A fast-transient control operating in conjunction with a linearly scaled gate-driving technique is used to concurrently improve the transient response and light-load efficiency of a dc-dc converter. The controller operates under a pulse-width modulation mode during steady state and enables a saturation mode during transient to attain fast transient response. The linearly scaled gate-driving technique optimizes the gate-driving voltage with respect to the changing load leading to lower gate-driving loss and better light-load efficiency. A prototype chip was implemented using a commercial 0.35-\u03bcm CMOS process to validate the proposed techniques. The measurement result shows a 5% increase in light-load efficiency and achieves an overall maximum efficiency of 90%. Moreover, the transient recovery time of a 450 mA step load change is less than 9 \u03bcs.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/6155677/06112186.pdf","startPage":"575","endPage":"583","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2011.2167259","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2011.2167259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6155677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Efficiency CMOS DC-DC Converter With 9--s Transient Recovery Time","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Transient analysis","Pulse width modulation","Power transistors","Voltage control","Transient response","Switching frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","DC-DC power convertors","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-efficiency CMOS dc-dc converter","fast transient recovery","linearly scaled gate-driving technique","transient response","light-load efficiency","pulsewidth modulation mode","PWM mode","saturation mode","gate-driving voltage","light-load efficiency","time 9 mus","size 0.35 mum","efficiency 90 percent","current 450 mA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS","dc-dc converter","efficiency","transient response"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112186/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"A High-Efficiency CMOS DC-DC Converter With 9-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\ \\mu$</tex></formula>s Transient Recovery Time","volume":"59","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6112186/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12556359","dateOfInsertion":"23 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Efficiency CMOS DC-DC Converter With 9-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\ \\mu$</tex></formula>s Transient Recovery Time","sourcePdf":"tcsi-chen-2167259-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11083S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6155677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6155677","articleId":"6112186","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6112200,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6387661/6112200/6112200-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang Li received the B.S. degree in mircoelectronics from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2006 and the M.Sc. degree from University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K., in 2008, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Communications Research Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science.","His research interests include energy-efficient hardware architectures for turbo or LDPC codes and their applications in energy-constrained scenarios, such as wireless sensor networks."]},"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Li","id":"38273253000"},{"name":"Robert G.

Recently, the use of videos from cameras in the OR has demonstrated its efficiency. In this paper, we propose a framework to assist in the development of systems for the automatic recognition of high-level surgical tasks using microscope videos analysis. We validated its use on cataract procedures. The idea is to combine state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with time series analysis. The first step of the framework consisted in the definition of several visual cues for extracting semantic information, therefore, characterizing each frame of the video. Five different pieces of image-based classifiers were, therefore, implemented. A step of pupil segmentation was also applied for dedicated visual cue detection. Time series classification algorithms were then applied to model time-varying data. Dynamic time warping and hidden Markov models were tested. This association combined the advantages of all methods for better understanding of the problem. The framework was finally validated through various studies. Six binary visual cues were chosen along with 12 phases to detect, obtaining accuracies of 94%.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2011.2181168","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6170948/06112207.pdf","startPage":"966","endPage":"976","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2011.2181168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for the Recognition of High-Level Surgical Tasks From Video Images for Cataract Surgeries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112207/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for the Recognition of High-Level Surgical Tasks From Video Images for Cataract Surgeries","volume":"59","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12592560","pubMedId":"22203700","publicationDate":"April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6112207/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for the Recognition of High-Level Surgical Tasks From Video Images for Cataract Surgeries","sourcePdf":"tbme-lalys-2181168-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067578S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6170948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6170948","articleId":"6112207","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6112212,"authors":[{"name":"Frede Blaabjerg","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/6170956/6112212/6112212-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Frede Blaabjerg (S'86\u2013M'88\u2013SM'97\u2013F'03) received the M.Sc.EE. and Ph.D. degrees from Aalborg University, Aalborg East, Denmark, in 1987 and 1995, respectively.","He was employed at ABB-Scandia, Randers, from 1987 to 1988.

In this paper, power converter technologies are reviewed with focus on existing ones and on those that have potential for higher power but which have not been yet adopted due to the important risk associated with the high-power industry. The power converters are classified into single- and multicell topologies, in the latter case with attention to series connection and parallel connection either electrical or magnetic ones (multiphase/windings machines/transformers). It is concluded that as the power level increases in wind turbines, medium-voltage power converters will be a dominant power converter configuration, but continuously cost and reliability are important issues to be addressed.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2011.2181290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2011.2181290","startPage":"708","endPage":"719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/28/6170956/06112212.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170956","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Electronics Converters for Wind Turbine Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112212/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Power Electronics Converters for Wind Turbine Systems","volume":"48","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12615125","publicationDate":"March-April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6112212/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Electronics Converters for Wind Turbine Systems","sourcePdf":"tia-blaabjerg-2181290-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110777S","chronDate":"March-April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6170956","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"581","xplore-issue":"6170956","articleId":"6112212","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6112218,"authors":[{"name":"Luigi Ferrigno","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automazione, Elettromagnetismo, Ingegneria dellInformazione e Matematica Industriale, University of Cassino, Cassino, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6178360/6112218/6112218-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Luigi Ferrigno (M'04) received the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from the University of Salerno, Fisciano, Italy, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.","He is currently an Aggregate Professor of electrical and electronic measurements with the Dipartimento di Automazione, Elettromagnetismo, Ingegneria dell'Informazione e Matematica Industriale, University of Cassino, Cassino, Italy, where he is also the Chief of the Metrological Laboratory.

Because of their intrinsic nonlinearity, real resistors, inductors, capacitors, and so on show behaviors that are very different from those expected in a sinusoidal environment. Consequently, a problem of reliable assessment of these components in the presence of nonsinusoidal environments arises. This problem is even more critical in applications such as the creation of hybrid filters, control circuits based on patterns of sensing elements, and circuits of digital protection in power systems, where the design and control of electrical and electronic circuits depend on the correct modeling of the R, L, and C components. In previous research works, the authors proposed a suitable measurement method for the estimation of R, L, and C parameters of passive components in nonsinusoidal conditions. This paper deals with the realization of a measurement instrument, based on a Field Gate Programmable Array, that is able to continuously update the estimated values of the considered components. The instrument realization passes through an optimized implementation of the previously proposed measurement method aimed at minimizing the hardware resources and the computational burden and increasing the measurement rate. After a preliminary tuning of the measurement method, carried out in a simulation environment, the hardware and the software architectures of the realized measurement instrument, together with the measurement strategy, are described and experimentally characterized.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2176165","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6178360/06112218.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6178360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2176165","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","startPage":"1503","endPage":"1511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-Based Instrument for the Estimation of -, -, and - Parameters Under Nonsinusoidal Conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"An FPGA-Based Instrument for the Estimation of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$R$</tex> </formula>, <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$L$</tex></formula>, and <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$C$</tex> </formula> Parameters Under Nonsinusoidal Conditions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112218/","volume":"61","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6112218/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12639177","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An FPGA-Based Instrument for the Estimation of <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$R$</tex> </formula>, <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$L$</tex></formula>, and <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$C$</tex> </formula> Parameters Under Nonsinusoidal Conditions","sourcePdf":"tim-laracca-2176165-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071182S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6178360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6178360","articleId":"6112218","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6112220,"authors":[{"name":"Zvi Devir","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6170603/6112220/6112220-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zvi Devir received the B.A. degrees in mathematics and in computer science and the M.Sc. degree in computer science from the Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, in 2000, 2000, and 2007, respectively.","From 2006 to 2010, he was with Medic Vision Imaging Solutions, Haifa, Israel, a company he cofounded, where he was the Chief Scientific Officer.

In order to perform FR tasks, the proposed LCVBP feature is generated by combining multiple features extracted from both color norm patterns and color angular patterns. Extensive and comparative experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed LCVBP feature on five public databases.

However, the number of descriptions in the existing MDC schemes is very small (typically 2). With the number of descriptions increasing, the coding complexity increases drastically and many decoders would be required. In this paper, the compressive sensing (CS) principles are studied and an alternative coding paradigm with a number of descriptions is proposed based upon CS for high packet loss transmission. Two-dimentional discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied for sparse representation. Unlike the typical wavelet coders (e.g., JPEG 2000), DWT coefficients here are not directly encoded, but re-sampled towards equal importance of information instead. At the decoder side, by fully exploiting the intra-scale and inter-scale correlation of multiscale DWT, two different CS recovery algorithms are developed for the low-frequency subband and high-frequency subbands, respectively. The recovery quality only depends on the number of received CS measurements (not on which of the measurements that are received). Experimental results show that the proposed CS-based codec is much more robust against lossy channels, while achieving higher rate-distortion (R-D) performance compared with conventional wavelet-based MDC methods and relevant existing CS-based coding schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

stereo matching algorithm that exploits the asynchronous visual events from a pair of silicon retinas. Unlike conventional frame-based cameras, recent artificial retinas transmit their outputs as a continuous stream of asynchronous temporal events, in a manner similar to the output cells of the biological retina. Our algorithm uses the timing information carried by this representation in addressing the stereo-matching problem on moving objects. Using the high temporal resolution of the acquired data stream for the dynamic vision sensor, we show that matching on the timing of the visual events provides a new solution to the real-time computation of 3-D objects when combined with geometric constraints using the distance to the epipolar lines. The proposed algorithm is able to filter out incorrect matches and to accurately reconstruct the depth of moving objects despite the low spatial resolution of the sensor. This brief sets up the principles for further event-based vision processing and demonstrates the importance of dynamic information and spike timing in processing asynchronous streams of visual events.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2180025","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6145493/06112233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2180025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145493","startPage":"347","endPage":"353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous Event-Based Binocular Stereo Matching","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112233","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous Event-Based Binocular Stereo Matching","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112233/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509366","pubMedId":"24808513","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6112233/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous Event-Based Binocular Stereo Matching","sourcePdf":"tnnls-benosman-2180025-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05679S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6145493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6145493","articleId":"6112233","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6112237,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiang-Chih Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/6202773/6112237/6112237-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hsiang-Chih Chang was born in Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1983.

Six stepping delay flickering sequences (SDFSs) at 32-Hz flickering frequency were used to implement a six-command BCI system. EEG signals recorded from Oz position were first filtered within 29-35 Hz, segmented based on trigger events of SDFSs to obtain SDFS epochs, and then stored separately in epoch registers. An epoch-average process suppressed the inter-SDFS interference. For each detection point, the latest six SDFS epochs in each epoch register were averaged and the normalized power of averaged responses was calculated. The visual target that induced the maximum normalized power was identified as the visual target. Eight subjects were recruited in this study.

The proposed R controller is input-output equivalent to the conventional R controller but it is internally nonlinear. Its internal state variables are the transformed versions of the conventional R controller into the polar coordinates. It is, thus, given the name of polar form resonant (PFR) controller. While the PFR is totally equivalent to the R controller in continuous-time domain, it offers a much higher structural robustness when it comes to digital implementations. Particularly, it is shown in this paper that the PFR resolves the well-known structural sensitivity of the R controller for applications that need high sampling frequency and have word length limitations. Such a structural sensitivity is conventionally resolved by resorting to the delta-domain realizations. The PFR offers an alternative method to the delta-domain realization technique with even higher degree of robustness and easier stage of adjustment. Moreover, the PFR can easily be enhanced to accommodate frequency variations, a feature that is not easily attainable using the delta-domain method. Feasibility of the PFR controller is verified using a laboratory prototype of a single-phase uninterruptible power supply system operating at high sampling and switching frequencies where the control system is implemented on a field programmable gate array board.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6177741/06112241.pdf","startPage":"3352","endPage":"3362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2181422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2181422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6177741","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Resonant Controller With High Structural Robustness for Fixed-Point Digital Implementations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency control","Resonant frequency","Robustness","Sensitivity","Transfer functions","Phase locked loops","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous time systems","digital control","field programmable gate arrays","nonlinear control systems","robust control","sensitivity analysis","uninterruptible power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonant controller","structural robustness","fixed point digital implementation","nonlinear controller","state variables","polar form resonant","PFR controller","continuous time domain","structural sensitivity","delta domain realization technique","uninterruptible power supply system","sampling frequency","switching frequency","field programmable gate array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delta-domain realization","fixed-point implementation","high sampling frequency","phase-locked loop (PLL)","resonant controller","robust realization","uninterruptible power supply (UPS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112241/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Resonant Controller With High Structural Robustness for Fixed-Point Digital Implementations","volume":"27","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6112241/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12638752","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Resonant Controller With High Structural Robustness for Fixed-Point Digital Implementations","sourcePdf":"tpel-khajehoddin-2181422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084723S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6177741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6177741","articleId":"6112241","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":6112249,"authors":[{"name":"Chunshan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, York, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6165492/6112249/6112249-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chunshan Liu received the B.S. degree in physics from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 2007, and the M.Sc. degree with distinction in communication engineering from the University of York, York, U.K., in 2008.","Currently, he is pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering at the University of York, York, U.K., since 2008.

However, known MF beamforming techniques fail to provide good performance for multiple sources, a high noise power, and/or when the sources are close to each other. This paper proposes an MF technique for solving the localization problem. The proposed technique exploits formulation of the localization problem in terms of sparse representation of a small number of source positions among a much larger number of potential positions. The sparse representation is formulated as the basis pursuit de-noising (BPDN) problem for complex-valued variables. The solution is found as a joint solution to a set of BPDN problems corresponding to the set of source frequencies subject to the joint support. The joint BPDN problem is efficiently solved using the Homotopy approach and coordinate descent search. For further reduction in the complexity, a position grid refinement method is applied. Using simulated and real experimental data, it is shown that the technique can provide accurate source localization for multiple sources. The proposed technique outperforms other MF techniques in resolving sources positioned closely to each other, tolerance to the noise and capability of locating multiple sources.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6165492/06112249.pdf","startPage":"1708","endPage":"1717","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2181506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2181506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165492","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadband Underwater Localization of Multiple Sources Using Basis Pursuit De-Noising","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Cost function","Frequency modulation","Complexity theory","Noise","Program processors","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","broadcast communication","signal denoising","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband underwater localization","basis pursuit de-noising","multiple underwater acoustic source location","antenna array beamforming","matched field processing","sparse representation","Homotopy approach","coordinate descent search"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Basis pursuit de-noising (BPDN)","coordinate descent","homotopy","matched-field (MF) processing","multisource localization","sparse representation","underwater acoustics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Broadband Underwater Localization of Multiple Sources Using Basis Pursuit De-Noising","volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6112249/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12591164","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadband Underwater Localization of Multiple Sources Using Basis Pursuit De-Noising","sourcePdf":"tsp-liu-2181506-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069674S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6165492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6165492","articleId":"6112249","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6112250,"authors":[{"name":"Heejung Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6165492/6112250/6112250-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Heejung Yu (S'07) received the B.S. degree in radio science and engineering from the Korea University, Seoul, in 1999, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, in 2001 and 2011, respectively.","Since 2001, he has been with the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Korea.

Based on a linear formulation for interference alignment, a predictive beam tracking algorithm is proposed using matrix perturbation theory. The proposed algorithm, based on a mixture of iteration and update, computes interference-aligning beamforming vectors at the current time by updating the previous beam vectors based on the channel difference between the two time steps during the predictively updating phase, and yields significant reduction in computational complexity compared with existing methods recalculating beams at each time step. The tracking performance of the algorithm is analyzed in terms of mean square error and sum rate loss between the predictively updating approach and the recalculating approach, and the impact of imperfect channel knowledge is also investigated under the state-space channel model. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm has almost the same performance as non-predictive methods in sum rate. Thus, the proposed algorithm provides a very efficient way to realize interference alignment in a realistic slowly fading MIMO channel environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6165492/06112250.pdf","startPage":"1910","endPage":"1926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2181502","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2181502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165492","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam Tracking for Interference Alignment in Slowly Fading MIMO Interference Channels: A Perturbations Approach Under a Linear Framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Vectors","Array signal processing","MIMO","Signal processing algorithms","Transmitters","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","fading channels","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["slowly fading MIMO interference channel","perturbations approach","linear framework","beam design","signal-space interference alignment","slowly fading multiuser multiple-input multiple-output interference channel","linear formulation","predictive beam tracking algorithm","matrix perturbation theory","interference-aligning beamforming vector","channel difference","predictively updating phase","computational complexity","tracking performance","mean square error","sum rate loss","predictively updating approach","recalculating approach","state-space channel model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interference alignment","least squares","null space tracking","perturbation theory","predictive algorithm","slowly fading channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112250/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Beam Tracking for Interference Alignment in Slowly Fading MIMO Interference Channels: A Perturbations Approach Under a Linear Framework","volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6112250/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12591165","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam Tracking for Interference Alignment in Slowly Fading MIMO Interference Channels: A Perturbations Approach Under a Linear Framework","sourcePdf":"tsp-sung-2181502-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11922S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6165492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6165492","articleId":"6112250","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6112251,"authors":[{"name":"Yulong Zou","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ, USA","Institute of Signal Processing and Transmission, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6165492/6112251/6112251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yulong Zou (S'09\u2013M'11) received the B.Eng. degree in Information Engineering from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NUPT), Nanjing China, in 2006.","He is currently working toward the dual Ph.D. degree at the Institute of Signal Processing and Transmission of NUPT, and the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT), Hoboken, NJ.

We propose two O-DSTC schemes for the full-duplex and half-duplex relaying scenarios, which are, respectively, referred to as the full-duplex and half-duplex-based O-DSTC. We evaluate the outage performance of the proposed O-DSTC as well as the conventional selective DF (S-DF) cooperation and fixed DSTC (F-DSTC) schemes. Numerical results show that the O-DSTC outperforms the conventional S-DF and F-DSTC schemes considering both full-duplex and half-duplex. In addition, we develop the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) of the proposed O-DSTC, conventional S-DF and F-DSTC schemes by considering the two cooperative users with different data rates (also known as different multiplexing gains). We show that, for both the full-duplex and half-duplex modes, the proposed O-DSTC strictly outperforms the conventional S-DF and F-DSTC in terms of DMT. It is also shown that, in the full-duplex-based O-DSTC scheme, the diversity gain obtained by any of the two cooperative users not only depends on its own multiplexing gain, but also relates to its partner's multiplexing gain. By jointly considering the two users' DMT, the full-duplex-based O-DSTC scheme can achieve the optimal diversity gain when the two users are with the same multiplexing gain. For the half-duplex-based O-DSTC scheme, the DMT performance of the two users are independent of each other, which differs from the full-duplex-based O-DSTC scheme where mutual dependence exists between the cooperative users in terms of DMT.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6165492/06112251.pdf","startPage":"1766","endPage":"1781","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2181503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2181503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165492","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Distributed Space-Time Coding for Decode-and-Forward Cooperation Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Multiplexing","Decoding","Relays","Diversity methods","Fading","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","diversity reception","multiplexing","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic distributed space-time coding","decode-and-forward cooperation systems","DF cooperation system","cooperative users","opportunistic DSTC","full-duplex relaying scenario","half-duplex relaying scenario","full-duplex-based O-DSTC","half-duplex-based O-DSTC","selective DF cooperation scheme","S-DF cooperation scheme","fixed DSTC scheme","F-DSTC scheme","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","DMT","multiplexing gain","optimal diversity gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative diversity","decode-and-forward (DF)","distributed space-time coding (DSTC)","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT)","outage probability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Distributed Space-Time Coding for Decode-and-Forward Cooperation Systems","volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6112251/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12591166","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Distributed Space-Time Coding for Decode-and-Forward Cooperation Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-yao-2181503-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158885S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6165492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6165492","articleId":"6112251","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6112252,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammud Z.

We consider the coarse grain scalable (CGS) and medium grain scalable (MGS) extension of the H.264 standard as the encoding method and propose to perform a per-subcarrier transmit antenna selection such that spatial diversity is exploited. We formulate the problem of optimally allocating subcarriers and antennas among secondary users as a binary integer program, where optimality is defined in terms of the aggregate visual quality of received video sequences of all cognitive users. The proposed formulation caters to the staircase rate-distortion characteristics of CGS/MGS sequences and avoids allocating more resources than are necessary to attain a given visual quality. However, due to the high computational complexity involved in solving this hard integer program using discrete programming solvers, we reduce the resource allocation problem to a subset-sum problem. Although it remains -hard in general, we present two efficient methods to solve this subset-sum problem based on its structure. Simulation results demonstrate that the methods proposed lead to a solution that is close to the optimal. Moreover, we demonstrate that having multiple antennas at the cognitive base station reduces the outage probability of secondary users.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2181550","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6169213/06112252.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6169213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2181550","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"1060","endPage":"1073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Per-Subcarrier Antenna Selection for H.264 MGS/CGS Video Transmission Over Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Per-Subcarrier Antenna Selection for H.264 MGS/CGS Video Transmission Over Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112252/","volume":"61","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6112252/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12592415","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Per-Subcarrier Antenna Selection for H.264 MGS/CGS Video Transmission Over Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-bocus-2181550-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094108S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6169213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6169213","articleId":"6112252","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6112253,"authors":[{"name":"Claudia Campolo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Informatica, Matematica, Elettronica e Trasporti, University Mediterranea of Reggio Calabria, Reggio Calabria, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6151237/6112253/6112253-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Claudia Campolo (S'10) received the M.S. degree in telecommunications engineering and the Ph.D. degree from the University Mediterranea of Reggio Calabria, Reggio Calabria, Italy, in October 2007 and February 2011, respectively.","In 2008, she was a visiting Ph.D. student with the Department of Electronics Engineering, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy.

Broadcast data are neither acknowledged nor retransmitted in case of failure, which raises the possibility of frame loss due to channel errors and collisions with multiple simultaneous broadcasts. This paper aims at modeling periodic broadcasting on the control channel of IEEE Std. 802.11p vehicular networks with multichannel architecture.

Use of the embedded pilots of OFDM signals has been extensively studied in the literature. Such techniques rely on having correlated pilots to improve detection sensitivity. However, the impact of synchronization in accuracy and implementation impairments has not been thoroughly studied in the literature. This paper discusses the pilot-aided cyclostationary detection (PACSD) method as a practical structure to detect OFDM signals under asynchronous conditions. The presented analysis quantifies the performance of a detection method without exhaustive searching, compared with an ideal system. This paper goes on to investigate the impact of radio-frequency (RF) front-end nonidealities on the overall performance of the PACSD. We develop closed-form expressions for performance loss in the presence of in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) imbalance, carrier frequency offset, phase noise, and sampling clock frequency offset (SCFO). These results show that the most detrimental impairment is that of SCFO, where a 20-ppm offset can result in a 9-dB performance loss. We then present a modified detector structure to compensate for this huge loss. Analysis and simulation show that, using the modified technique, we can get within 2 dB of the ideal no-offset case.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6169213/06112255.pdf","startPage":"1208","endPage":"1221","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2181435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2181435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6169213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112255","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Sensing of OFDM Waveforms Using Embedded Pilots in the Presence of Impairments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Detectors","Synchronization","Feature extraction","Correlation","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","phase noise","spread spectrum communication","synchronisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM waveforms","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","embedded pilots","impairment presence","widespread deployment","OFDM-based wireless systems","reliable spectrum sensing","detection sensitivity","synchronization","pilot-aided cyclostationary detection","radiofrequency front-end nonideality","closed-form expressions","in-phase/quadrature imbalance","carrier frequency offset","phase noise","sampling clock frequency offset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","cyclostationary detection","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","spectrum sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Sensing of OFDM Waveforms Using Embedded Pilots in the Presence of Impairments","volume":"61","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6112255/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12592416","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Sensing of OFDM Waveforms Using Embedded Pilots in the Presence of Impairments","sourcePdf":"tvt-zahedighasabeh-2181435-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091712S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6169213","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6169213","articleId":"6112255","onlineDate":"23 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6112298,"authors":[{"name":"Raungrong Suleesathira","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology, Bangkok, Thailand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6112295/6112298/6112298-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Raungrong Suleesathira was born in Supanburi, Thailand, on March 22, 1971.

This paper presents the selective de- coding schemes in MAC protocol for multiple input multiple out- put ad-hoc networks. It is able to mitigate interferences by using a developed minimum mean-squared error technique. This interference mitigation combined with the maximum likelihood decoding schemes for the Alamouti coding enables the receiver to decode and differentiate the desired data streams from co-channel data streams. As a result, it allows a pair of simultaneous transmissions to the same or different nodes which yields the network utilization increase. Moreover, the presented three decoding schemes and time line operations are optimally selected corresponding to the trans- mission demand of neighboring nodes to avoid collision. The selection is determined by the number of request to send (RTS) packets and the type of clear to send packets. Both theoretical channel capacity and simulation results show that the proposed selective decoding scheme MAC protocol outperforms the mitigation interference using multiple antennas and the parallel RTS processing protocols for the cases of (1) single data stream and (2) two inde- pendent data streams which are simultaneously transmitted by two independent transmitters.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective decoding schemes and wireless MAC operating in MIMO ad hoc networks","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2011.6112298","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5449605/6112295/06112298.pdf","startPage":"421","endPage":"427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2011.6112298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112295","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Selective decoding schemes and wireless MAC operating in MIMO ad hoc networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6112298/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12503175","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective decoding schemes and wireless MAC operating in MIMO ad hoc networks","sourcePdf":"421.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074919S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6112295","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6112295","articleId":"6112298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6112300,"authors":[{"name":"Zhidong Xie","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Engineering, People's Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6112295/6112300/6112300-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhidong Xie was born in Gansu Province, China, on March 13, 1984.

Constant envelope modulation is an attractive scheme to be used in such cases for their needlessness of input power back-off about 2~3 dB for avoidance of nonlinear distortion induced by high power amplifier. The envelope of Feher quadrature phase shift keying (FQPSK) has a least fluctuation of 0.18 dB (quasi constant envelope) and can be further improved. This paper improves FQPSK by defining a set of new waveform functions, which changes FQPSK to be a strictly constant envelope modulation. The performance of the FQPSK adopting new wave- form is justified by analysis and simulation. The study results show that the novel FQPSK is immune to the impact of HPA and outperforms conventional FQPSK on bit error rate (BER) performance. The BER performance of this novel modulation is better than that of FQPSK by more than 0.5 dB at least and 2 dB at most.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constant envelope enhanced FQPSK and its performance analysis","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2011.6112300","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5449605/6112295/06112300.pdf","startPage":"442","endPage":"448","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2011.6112300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112295","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112300/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Constant envelope enhanced FQPSK and its performance analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6112300/","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12503177","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constant envelope enhanced FQPSK and its performance analysis","sourcePdf":"442.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054887S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6112295","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6112295","articleId":"6112300","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"KICS","_value":"JCN","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6112301,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Guo","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6112295/6112301/6112301-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ying Guo received his B.S. in 1999 in Qufu Normal University, China, M.S., in 2003 in Kunming University of Science and Technology, China, and Ph.D. degrees in 2006 in the Shanghai Jiaotong University, China.

They operate in different domains (frequency and time/space, respectively), and we want to know which domain shows overall best performance. We propose a novel formulation of the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) which allows us to prove the frequency/time duality of these schemes. Further, we propose two novel capacity optimization approaches assuming per-beam SINR constraints in order to use the satellite resources (e.g., power and bandwidth) more efficiently. Moreover, we develop a general methodology to include technological constraints due to realistic implementations, and obtain the main factors that prevent the two technologies dual of each other in practice, and formulate the technological gap between them. The Shannon capacity (upper bound) and current state-of-the-art coding and modulations are analyzed in order to quantify the gap and to evaluate the performance of the two candidate schemes. Simulation results show significant improvements in terms of power gain, spectral efficiency and traffic matching ratio when comparing with conventional systems, which are designed based on uniform bandwidth and power allocation. The results also show that BH system turns out to show a less complex design and performs better than NOFR system specially for non-real time services.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5449605/6112295/06112304.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"480","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2011.6112304","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2011.6112304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112295","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multibeam satellite frequency/time duality study and capacity optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Satellites","Resource management","Time frequency analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","encoding","frequency allocation","frequency hop communication","modulation","optimisation","satellite communication","spectral analysis","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multibeam satellite frequency-time duality","capacity optimization","candidate transmission scheme","nonorthogonal frequency reuse","beam-hopping","signal-to-interference plus noise ratio","SINR","satellite resource use","Shannon capacity","state-of-the-art coding","power gain","spectral efficiency","traffic matching ratio","uniform bandwidth","power allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beam-hopping (BH)","duality","frequency-reuse","multi-beam satellite","time-reuse"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multibeam satellite frequency/time duality study and capacity optimization","volume":"13","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6112304/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12503181","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multibeam satellite frequency/time duality study and capacity optimization","sourcePdf":"472.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07599S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6112295","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6112295","articleId":"6112304","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"KICS","_value":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6112305,"authors":[{"name":"Ni-Chun Wang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5449605/6112295/6112305/6112305-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ni-Chun Wang was born in Taipei, Taiwan.

Since the benefits from MIMO result in a heavy computational load in detectors, the design of low-complexity sub- optimum receivers is currently an active area of research. Lattice- reduction-aided detection (LRAD) has been shown to be an effective low-complexity method with near-maximum-likelihood performance. In this paper, we advocate the use of systolic array architectures for MIMO receivers, and in particular we exhibit one of them based on LRAD. The \"Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) lattice reduction algorithm\" and the ensuing linear detections or successive spatial-interference cancellations can be located in the same array, which is considerably hardware-efficient. Since the conventional form of the LLL algorithm is not immediately suitable for parallel processing, two modified LLL algorithms are considered here for the systolic array. LLL algorithm with full-size reduction- LLL is one of the versions more suitable for parallel processing. Another variant is the all-swap lattice-reduction (ASLR) algorithm for complex-valued lattices, which processes all lattice basis vectors simultaneously within one iteration. Our novel systolic array can operate both algorithms with different external logic controls. In order to simplify the systolic array design, we replace the Lovasz condition in the definition of LLL-reduced lattice with the looser Siegel condition. Simulation results show that for LR-aided linear detections, the bit-error-rate performance is still maintained with this relaxation. Comparisons between the two algorithms in terms of bit-error-rate performance, and average field-programmable gate array processing time in the systolic array are made, which shows that ASLR is a better choice for a systolic architecture, especially for systems with a large number of antennas.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2011.6112305","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5449605/6112295/06112305.pdf","startPage":"481","endPage":"493","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2011.6112305","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112295","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systolic arrays for lattice-reduction-aided mimo detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Systolic arrays for lattice-reduction-aided mimo detection","volume":"13","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12503182","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6112305/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112305/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systolic arrays for lattice-reduction-aided mimo detection","sourcePdf":"481.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09917S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5449605","isNumber":"6112295","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6112295","articleId":"6112305","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"KICS","_value":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6112335,"authors":[{"name":"Jia-Sheng Hu","affiliation":["National University of Tainan, Tainan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jia-Sheng","lastName":"Hu","id":"38024117500"},{"name":"Dejun Yin","affiliation":["Keio University, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Dejun","lastName":"Yin","id":"37646949000"},{"name":"Yoichi Hori","affiliation":["University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoichi","lastName":"Hori","id":"37272838800"},{"name":"Feng-Rung Hu","affiliation":["National Taichung University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Feng-Rung","lastName":"Hu","id":"38105637900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2618"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0598"}],"articleNumber":"6112335","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1414},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIEEE Industry Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112335","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric vehicles","Motion control","Friction","Robustness","Torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","machine control","torque control","torque measurement","traction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicle","traction control","MTTE methodology","undetectable road conditions","varying vehicle parameters","maximum transmissible torque estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MIAS.2011.2175519","endPage":"31","startPage":"23","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel5/2943/6148544/06112335.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MIAS.2011.2175519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electric Vehicle Traction Control: A New MTTE Methodology","abstract":"In motion control of electric vehicles (EVs), the undetectable road conditions and varying vehicle parameters challenge the steering ability and validity.

The conformation is formed by the permutations of amino-acids, and the permutation of the amino-acids, accomplishes the multiplicity of the protein. A great challenge in computational molecular biology is to predicate the protein native structure from its primary amino acid sequence. It is not difficult to obtain protein sequences. However to determine protein structure is not an easy task by current technologies. There is a large gap between them. Therefore, more research is needed to fill the gap.

Assessment of the foetal state can be verified only after delivery using the foetal (newborn) outcome data. One of the most important features defining the abnormal foetal outcome is low birth weight. This paper proposes a multi-class classification algorithm using Modular neural network (MNN) models. It tries to boost two conflicting main objectives of multi-class classifiers: a high correct classification rate level and a high classification rate for each class. Using a Cardiotocography database of normal, suspect and pathological cases, we trained MNN classifiers with 23 real valued diagnostic features collected from total 2126 foetal CTG signal recordings data from UCI Machine Learning Repository. We used the classification in a detection process. The proposed methodology is presented, which then is tested on UCI Cardiotocography unseen testing data sets. Experimental results are promising paving the way for further research in that direction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112501/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12460546","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6112501/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Modular neural network model based foetal state classification","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modular neural network model based foetal state classification","confLoc":"Atlanta, GA, USA","sourcePdf":"915BIBMW2011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045886S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105661","isNumber":"6112342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105661","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6112342","articleId":"6112501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6112538,"authors":[{"name":"David J.

The control objective is to enhance coherence of the formation by making it behave like a rigid lattice. For the single-integrator model with symmetric gains, we establish convexity, implying that the globally optimal controller can be computed efficiently. We also identify a class of convex problems for double-integrators by restricting the controller to symmetric position and uniform diagonal velocity gains. To obtain the optimal non-symmetric gains for both the single- and the double-integrator models, we solve a parameterized family of optimal control problems ranging from an easily solvable problem to the problem of interest as the underlying parameter increases. When this parameter is kept small, we employ perturbation analysis to decouple the matrix equations that result from the optimality conditions, thereby rendering the unique optimal feedback gain. This solution is used to initialize a homotopy-based Newton's method to find the optimal localized gain. To investigate the performance of localized controllers, we examine how the coherence of large-scale stochastically forced formations scales with the number of vehicles. We establish several explicit scaling relationships and show that the best performance is achieved by a localized controller that is both non-symmetric and spatially-varying.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Coherence","Optimal control","Symmetric matrices","Newton method","Microscopy","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled

A common-gate error amplifier with high bandwidth and slew rate is proposed to reduce the output voltage spike and the response time of the LDO greatly.

Hence, for high-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction through feature selection (not extraction) is very important. Our objective, here, is not to find an optimal rule base for classification but to select a set of useful features that may solve the classification problem. For this, we present an integrated mechanism for simultaneous extraction of fuzzy rules and selection of useful features. Since the feature selection method is integrated into the rule base formation, our scheme can account for possible subtle nonlinear interaction between features, as well as that between features and the tool, and, consequently, can select a set of useful features for the classification job. We have tried our method on several commonly used datasets as well as on a synthetic dataset with dimension varying from 4 to 60. Using a ten-fold cross-validation setup, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2181852","startPage":"683","endPage":"698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2011.2181852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6255855","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/6255855/06112676.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Integrated Mechanism for Feature Selection and Fuzzy Rule Extraction for Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112676/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Integrated Mechanism for Feature Selection and Fuzzy Rule Extraction for Classification","volume":"20","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6112676/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12894997","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Integrated Mechanism for Feature Selection and Fuzzy Rule Extraction for Classification","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-pal-2181852-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1007S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6255855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6255855","articleId":"6112676","onlineDate":"26 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6112682,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Yao","affiliation":["College of AeroSpace and Materials Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6145493/6112682/6112682-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wen Yao received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in aerospace engineering from National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, in 2005 and 2007, respectively, where she is currently a Ph.D. student.","She was a Visiting Scholar with the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands.

One of the challenges in RBFNN modeling is determining how to effectively optimize width parameters to improve approximation accuracy. To solve this problem, a width optimization method, concurrent subspace width optimization (CSWO), is proposed based on a decomposition and coordination strategy. This method decomposes the large-scale width optimization problem into several subspace optimization (SSO) problems, each of which has a single optimization variable and smaller training and validation data sets so as to greatly simplify optimization complexity. These SSOs can be solved concurrently, thus computational time can be effectively reduced. With top-level system coordination, the optimization of SSOs can converge to a consistent optimum, which is equivalent to the optimum of the original width optimization problem. The proposed method is tested with four mathematical examples and one practical engineering approximation problem. The results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of CSWO in optimizing width parameters over the traditional width optimization methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112682/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12509369","pubMedId":"24808504","volume":"23","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6112682/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Concurrent Subspace Width Optimization Method for RBF Neural Network Modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent Subspace Width Optimization Method for RBF Neural Network Modeling","sourcePdf":"tnnls-yao-2178560-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134331S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6145493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6145493","articleId":"6112682","onlineDate":"26 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6112683,"authors":[{"name":"Ye Yuanmao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6177741/6112683/6112683-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ye Yuanmao received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Jinan, Shandong, China, and the M.Sc. degree in control theory and control engineering from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.","He is currently a Research Assistant in the Department of Electrical Engineering, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

We adopt a statistical attack model in which every malicious node is characterized by a certain probability of attack. The key features of the proposed method are: (i) combined spectrum sensing, identification of malicious users, and estimation of their attack probabilities; (ii) use of belief propagation on factor graphs to efficiently solve the Bayesian estimation problem. Our analysis shows that the proposed joint estimation approach outperforms traditional cooperation schemes based on exclusion of the unreliable nodes from the spectrum sensing process, and that it nearly achieves the performance of an ideal maximum likelihood estimation if attack probabilities remain constant over a sufficient number of sensing time slots. Results illustrate that belief propagation applied to the considered problem is robust with respect to different network parameters (e.g., numbers of reliable and malicious nodes, attack probability values, sensing duration). Finally, spectrum sensing estimates obtained via belief propagation are proved to be consistent on average for arbitrary graph size.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2181839","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6165492/06112695.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2181839","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"1806","endPage":"1822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting and Counteracting Statistical Attacks in Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Detecting and Counteracting Statistical Attacks in Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112695/","volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6112695/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12591168","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting and Counteracting Statistical Attacks in Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","sourcePdf":"tsp-penna-2181839-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12075S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6165492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6165492","articleId":"6112695","onlineDate":"26 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6112697,"authors":[{"name":"Shaobu Wang","affiliation":["Center for Energy Systems Research, Tennessee Technological University, Cookeville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6186889/6112697/6112697-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shaobu Wang was born in Shandong Province, China.

The emerging wide-area measurement systems (WAMSs) offer new opportunities for developing more effective methods to monitor power system dynamics online. Recently, alternative methods for power system state estimation have caught much attention. Due to the nonlinearity of state transition and observation equation, linearization and Jacobian matrix calculation are indispensible in the existing methods of power system state estimation. This makes WAMS' high performance compromised by burdensome calculation. In order to overcome the drawbacks, this study tries to develop an effective state estimation method without the linearization and Jacobian matrix calculation. Firstly, unscented transformation is introduced as an effective method to calculate the means and covariances of a random vector undergoing a nonlinear transformation. Secondly, by embedding the unscented transformation into the Kalman filter process, a method is developed for power system dynamic state estimation. Finally, some simulation results are presented showing accuracy and easier implementation of the new method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Alternative Method for Power System Dynamic State Estimation Based on Unscented Transform","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2175255","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6186889/06112697.pdf","startPage":"942","endPage":"950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2175255","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6186889","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112697","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","displayDocTitle":"An Alternative Method for Power System Dynamic State Estimation Based on Unscented Transform","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6112697/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12692040","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Alternative Method for Power System Dynamic State Estimation Based on Unscented Transform","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-gao-2175255-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097739S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6186889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"157","xplore-issue":"6186889","articleId":"6112697","onlineDate":"26 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6112698,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hui Zhang (S'09) is from Nanjing, China.

Although remarkable advances have been made in optimization techniques, finding an optimal solution to a problem of this nature can still be extremely challenging.

The losses and generator cost are modeled as piecewise linear functions of the line flows and the generator outputs, respectively. The IEEE 24-bus system is used to compare the lossy and the lossless model. The results show that the lossy model provides savings in total cost in the long run. The selection of the best number of piecewise linear sections L is also shown. Then a complete planning framework is presented and a multi-stage TEP is performed on the IEEE 118-bus test system. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is accurate and efficient, and has the potential to be applied to large-scale power system planning problems.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2178000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/6186889/06112698.pdf","startPage":"1125","endPage":"1133","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2011.2178000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6186889","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Approach for Multi-Stage Security-Constrained Transmission Expansion Planning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112698","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112698/","displayDocTitle":"A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Approach for Multi-Stage Security-Constrained Transmission Expansion Planning","volume":"27","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12692041","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6112698/","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Approach for Multi-Stage Security-Constrained Transmission Expansion Planning","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-heydt-2178000-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110076S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6186889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"6186889","articleId":"6112698","onlineDate":"26 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6112699,"authors":[{"name":"Olle Sundstrom","affiliation":["IBM Research, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/6155182/6112699/6112699-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Olle Sundstr\u00f6m (M'06) was born in \u00d6rebro, Sweden, in 1980.

The ultradense WDM-PON system evaluated in this paper transports high-order modulation formats such as M-ary phase-shift keying (PSK) and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) in which coherent detection is performed at the optical network unit (ONU), after transmission over 25 km, 60 km, and 100 km of standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). The first part of this work covers the impact on the system's performance of the most relevant fiber nonlinearities such as self-phase modulation (SPM), cross-phase modulation (XPM) and four-wave mixing (FWM), and their interplay between transmission distance and modulation format. Using a Volterra series method allows estimating the error vector magnitude (EVM) of the received constellation related to different fiber nonlinearities. In a 32 \u00d7 625 Mbaud system spaced by 3 GHz (0.025 nm), the FWM to XPM ratio (F/X) varied from 25 up to 30 dB for phase-modulated signals (1.25 Gb/s-QPSK and 1.875 Gb/s-8PSK). On the other hand, this ratio ranged from 2.6 to 7.4 dB for amplitude-modulated signals (2.5 Gb/s-16QAM, 3.75 Gb/s-64QAM and 5 Gb/s-256QAM). After applying a frequency-allocation scheme at both transmitter and local oscillator lasers, some of the FWM crosstalk is mitigated by 2.4 to 3.5 dB. This EVM reduction confirms that increasing the transmission distance and the order of the constellation, the system's performance becomes limited by both interchannel FWM and XPM.","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6133492/06112703.pdf","startPage":"234","endPage":"241","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6133492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2180698","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2180698","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112703","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shift keying","Optical fibers","Optical fiber networks","Adaptive optics","Nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency allocation","optical modulation","passive optical networks","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","Volterra series","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fibre nonlinearity analysis","coherent ultradense WDM-PON system","wavelength-division multiplexing","passive optical networks","high-order modulation formats","M-ary phase-shift keying","M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation","QAM","optical network unit","standard single-mode fiber","self-phase modulation","cross-phase modulation","four-wave mixing","transmission distance","Volterra series method","error vector magnitude estimation","phase-modulated signals","QPSK","frequency-allocation scheme","local oscillator lasers","transmitter","FWM crosstalk","EVM reduction","distance 25 km","distance 60 km","distance 100 km","frequency 3 GHz","bit rate 1.25 Gbit/s","bit rate 1.875 Gbit/s","bit rate 2.5 Gbit/s","bit rate 3.75 Gbit/s","bit rate 5 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Advanced modulation formats","coherent optical communication systems","passive optical networks","ultradense WDM","Volterra series"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112703/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Nonlinearities on Coherent Ultradense WDM-PONs Using Volterra Series","accessionNumber":"12486296","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2012","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6112703/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Nonlinearities on Coherent Ultradense WDM-PONs Using Volterra Series","sourcePdf":"jlt-reis-2180698-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097855S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6133492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6133492","articleId":"6112703","onlineDate":"26 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6112710,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel.

We assume that all source signals share a common sparse representation basis. The approach combines classical Compressive Sensing (CS) theory with a linear mixing model. It allows the mixtures to be sampled independently of each other. If samples are acquired in the time domain, this means that the sensors need not be synchronized. Since Blind Source Separation (BSS) from a linear mixture is only possible up to permutation and scaling, factoring out these ambiguities leads to a minimization problem on the so-called oblique manifold. We develop a geometric conjugate subgradient method that scales to large systems for solving the problem. Numerical results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed algorithm compared to several state of the art methods.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2011.2181945","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/6107926/06112711.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2011.2181945","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6107926","startPage":"107","endPage":"110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Source Separation With Compressively Sensed Linear Mixtures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112711","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind Source Separation With Compressively Sensed Linear Mixtures","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112711/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12467741","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6112711/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Source Separation With Compressively Sensed Linear Mixtures","sourcePdf":"lsp-shen-2181945-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143256S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6107926","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6107926","articleId":"6112711","onlineDate":"26 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6112716,"authors":[{"name":"Sabrina Gerbracht","affiliation":["Chair for Communications Theory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6166811/6112716/6112716-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sabrina Gerbracht received the Diplom Medien-Informatiker (M.S.) degree in media computer science from the Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden (TUD), Germany, in 2007, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","Since June 2007, she has been a Research Assistant with the Communications Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, TUD.

In many recent works on the multiple antenna wiretap channel, perfect channel state information to the intended receiver as well as the passive eavesdropper are assumed. In this paper, the transmitter has only partial information about the channel to the eavesdropper, but full information on the main channel to the intended receiver. The applied channel model is the flat-fading multiple-input single-output wiretap channel. We minimize the outage probability of secure transmission under single-stream beamforming and the use of artificial noise in the null space of the main channel. Furthermore, we derive a suboptimal beamforming scheme based on a Markov bound, which performs reasonably well. The results generalize the cases with perfect as well as without channel state information of the eavesdropper channel. Numerical simulations illustrate the secrecy outage probability over the degree of channel knowledge and confirm the theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2181946","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6166811/06112716.pdf","startPage":"704","endPage":"716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6166811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2181946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy Outage in MISO Systems With Partial Channel Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Outage in MISO Systems With Partial Channel Information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112716/","publicationDate":"April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12578167","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6112716/","volume":"7","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy Outage in MISO Systems With Partial Channel Information","sourcePdf":"tifs-gerbracht-2181946-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106124S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6166811","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"6166811","articleId":"6112716","onlineDate":"26 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6112718,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Vahid","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Alireza Vahid received his B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2009.

Related prior works focus on the case where feedback links have infinite capacity, while no research has been done for the rate-limited feedback problem. Several new challenges arise due to the capacity limitations of the feedback links, both in deriving inner bounds and outer bounds. We study this problem under three different interference models: the El Gamal-Costa deterministic model, the linear deterministic model, and the Gaussian model. For the first two models, we develop an achievable scheme that employs three techniques: Han-Kobayashi message splitting, quantize-and-binning, and decode-and-forward. We also derive new outer bounds for all three models and we show the optimality of our scheme under the linear deterministic model. In the Gaussian case, we propose a transmission strategy that incorporates lattice codes, inspired by the ideas developed in the first two models. For symmetric channel gains, we prove that the gap between the achievable sum rate of the proposed scheme and our new outer bounds is bounded by a constant number of bits, independent of the channel gains.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2181938","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6185725/06112718.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6185725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2181938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"2788","endPage":"2812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Channels With Rate-Limited Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112718","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Interference Channels With Rate-Limited Feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112718/","volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6112718/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","accessionNumber":"12670005","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Channels With Rate-Limited Feedback","sourcePdf":"tit-vahid-2181938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141414S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6185725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6185725","articleId":"6112718","onlineDate":"26 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6112724,"authors":[{"name":"Renchao Xie","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6151237/6112724/6112724-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Renchao Xie is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China.","From November 2010 to November 2011, he was with Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada, as a Visiting Scholar.

Although some work has been done for dynamic resource allocation in CRNs, many works assume that the radio environment can perfectly be sensed. However, in practice, it is difficult for the secondary network to have the perfect knowledge of a dynamic radio environment in CRNs. In this paper, we study the dynamic resource allocation problem for heterogeneous services in CRNs with imperfect channel sensing. We formulate the power and channel allocation problem as a mixed-integer programming problem under constraints. The computational complexity is enormous to solve the problem. To reduce the computational complexity, we tackle this problem in two steps. First, we solve the optimal power allocation problem using the Lagrangian dual method under the assumption of known channel allocation. Next, we solve the joint power and channel allocation problem using the discrete stochastic optimization method, which has low computational complexity and fast convergence to approximate to the optimal solution. Another advantage of this method is that it can track the changing radio environment to dynamically allocate the resources. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2181966","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6151237/06112724.pdf","startPage":"770","endPage":"780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2181966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Services in Cognitive Radio Networks With Imperfect Channel Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112724/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Services in Cognitive Radio Networks With Imperfect Channel Sensing","volume":"61","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12536781","htmlLink":"/document/6112724/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Resource Allocation for Heterogeneous Services in Cognitive Radio Networks With Imperfect Channel Sensing","sourcePdf":"tvt-yu-2181966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106371S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6151237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"6151237","articleId":"6112724","onlineDate":"26 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6112747,"authors":[{"name":"Phillip J.

This has enabled a whole host of new applications that rely on high-throughput computations. Recently, the need for faster and cost-effective applications in form-factor constrained environments has driven an interest in on-chip acceleration of algorithms based on Monte Carlo simulations. Though Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), with hundreds of on-chip arithmetic units, show significant promise for accelerating these embarrassingly parallel simulations, a challenge exists in sharing access to simulation data among many concurrent experiments. This paper presents a compute architecture for accelerating Monte Carlo simulations based on the Network-on-Chip (NOC) paradigm for on-chip communication. We demonstrate through the complete implementation of a Monte Carlo-based image reconstruction algorithm for Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) imaging that this complex problem can be accelerated by two orders of magnitude on even a modestly sized FPGA over a 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor. The architecture and the methodology that we present in this paper is modular and hence it is scalable to problem instances of different sizes, with application to other domains that rely on Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2011.250","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/6425383/06112747.pdf","startPage":"524","endPage":"535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2011.250","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6425383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NoC-Based FPGA Acceleration for Monte Carlo Simulations with Applications to SPECT Imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"NoC-Based FPGA Acceleration for Monte Carlo Simulations with Applications to SPECT Imaging","volume":"62","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2013","accessionNumber":"13270617","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6112747/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112747/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NoC-Based FPGA Acceleration for Monte Carlo Simulations with Applications to SPECT Imaging","sourcePdf":"ttc2013030524.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115897S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"6425383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6425383","articleId":"6112747","onlineDate":"27 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6112748,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/6425383/6112748/6112748-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bin Liu received the BS degree in information engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, in 2007, and the MS degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Davis, in 2010, where he is currently toward the PhD degree.

Features from ambient audio are used to generate a shared cryptographic key between devices without exchanging information about the ambient audio itself or the features utilized for the key generation process. We explore a common audio-fingerprinting approach and account for the noise in the derived fingerprints by employing error correcting codes. This fuzzy-cryptography scheme enables the adaptation of a specific value for the tolerated noise among fingerprints based on environmental conditions by altering the parameters of the error correction and the length of the audio samples utilized. In this paper, we experimentally verify the feasibility of the protocol in four different realistic settings and a laboratory experiment. The case studies include an office setting, a scenario where an attacker is capable of reproducing parts of the audio context, a setting near a traffic loaded road, and a crowded canteen environment. We apply statistical tests to show that the entropy of fingerprints based on ambient audio is high. The proposed scheme constitutes a totally unobtrusive but cryptographically strong security mechanism based on contextual information.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2011.271","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/6387244/06112755.pdf","startPage":"358","endPage":"370","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2011.271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Communication Based on Ambient Audio","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"Secure Communication Based on Ambient Audio","volume":"12","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6112755/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"13189894","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112755/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Communication Based on Ambient Audio","sourcePdf":"ttm2013020358.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082547S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","isNumber":"6387244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"83","articleId":"6112755","onlineDate":"27 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":6112756,"authors":[{"name":"Shaxun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/6415493/6112756/6112756-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shaxun Chen received the BSc and MSc degrees in computer science from Nanjing University, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

Such an attack is called primary user emulation (PUE) attack. TV towers and wireless microphones are two main types of primary users in white space. Existing work on PUE attack detection only focused on the first category. For the latter category, primary users are mobile and their transmission power is low. These properties introduce great challenges on PUE detection and existing methods are not applicable. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect the emulation attack of wireless microphones. We exploit the relationship between RF signals and acoustic information to verify the existence of wireless microphones. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through real-world implementation. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves both false positive rate and false negative rate lower than 0.1 even in a noisy environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112756/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","volume":"12","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"13245090","publicationDate":"March 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6112756/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2013","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hearing Is Believing: Detecting Wireless Microphone Emulation Attacks in White Space","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hearing Is Believing: Detecting Wireless Microphone Emulation Attacks in White Space","sourcePdf":"ttm2013030401.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058404S","chronDate":"March  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6415493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6415493","articleId":"6112756","onlineDate":"27 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6112758,"authors":[{"name":"Eugene Y.

The proposed CGI template first extracts the contour in each gait frame, followed by encoding each of the gait contour images in the same gait sequence with a multichannel mapping function and compositing them to a single CGI. To make the templates robust to a complex surrounding environment, we also propose CGI-based real and synthetic temporal information preserving templates by using different gait periods and contour distortion techniques.

Under the general integrated segmentation-and-recognition framework with character oversegmentation, we investigate three important issues: candidate path evaluation, path search, and parameter estimation. For path evaluation, we combine multiple contexts (character recognition scores, geometric and linguistic contexts) from the Bayesian decision view, and convert the classifier outputs to posterior probabilities via confidence transformation. In path search, we use a refined beam search algorithm to improve the search efficiency and, meanwhile, use a candidate character augmentation strategy to improve the recognition accuracy. The combining weights of the path evaluation function are optimized by supervised learning using a Maximum Character Accuracy criterion. We evaluated the recognition performance on a Chinese handwriting database CASIA-HWDB, which contains nearly four million character samples of 7,356 classes and 5,091 pages of unconstrained handwritten texts. The experimental results show that confidence transformation and combining multiple contexts improve the text line recognition performance significantly. On a test set of 1,015 handwritten pages, the proposed approach achieved character-level accurate rate of 90.75 percent and correct rate of 91.39 percent, which are superior by far to the best results reported in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.264","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6218247/06112767.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6218247","startPage":"1469","endPage":"1481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Handwritten Chinese Text Recognition by Integrating Multiple Contexts","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Handwritten Chinese Text Recognition by Integrating Multiple Contexts","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112767/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"34","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","accessionNumber":"12786771","pubMedId":"22201052","dateOfInsertion":"14 June 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6112767/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Handwritten Chinese Text Recognition by Integrating Multiple Contexts","sourcePdf":"ttp2012081469.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095424S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6218247","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"6218247","articleId":"6112767","onlineDate":"27 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6112770,"authors":[{"name":"Vivek Kaul","affiliation":["Jumio, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6269017/6112770/6112770-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vivek Kaul received the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2010.

Curves which branch require even further prior input from the user, namely, each branch endpoint. In this work, we present a novel minimal path-based algorithm which works on much more general curve topologies with far fewer demands on the user for initial input compared to prior minimal path-based algorithms. The two key novelties and benefits of this new approach are that 1) it may be used to detect both open and closed curves, including more complex topologies containing both multiple branch points and multiple closed cycles without requiring a priori knowledge about which of these types is to be extracted, and 2) it requires only a single input point which, in contrast to existing methods, is no longer constrained to be an endpoint of the desired curve but may in fact be ANY point along the desired curve (even an internal point). We perform quantitative evaluation of the algorithm on 48 images (44 pavement crack images, 1 catheter tube image, and 3 retinal images) against human supplied ground truth. The results demonstrate that the algorithm is indeed able to extract curve-like objects accurately from images with far less prior knowledge and less user interaction compared to existing state-of-the-art minimal path-based image processing algorithms. In the future, the algorithm can be applied to other 2D curve-like objects and it can be extended to detect 3D curves.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6269017/06112770.pdf","startPage":"1952","endPage":"1965","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6269017","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112770","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting Curves with Unknown Endpoints and Arbitrary Topology Using Minimal Paths","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Euclidean distance","Mathematical model","Three dimensional displays","Topology","Minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Minimal paths","keypoints","multiple branches","closed cycles","arbitrary topology","curve detection","cracks."]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Diagnostic Imaging","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Reproducibility of Results","Retina"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Detecting Curves with Unknown Endpoints and Arbitrary Topology Using Minimal Paths","volume":"34","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6112770/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","pubMedId":"22201054","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting Curves with Unknown Endpoints and Arbitrary Topology Using Minimal Paths","sourcePdf":"ttp2012101952.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101376S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6269017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6269017","articleId":"6112770","onlineDate":"27 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6112774,"authors":[{"name":"Stas Goferman","affiliation":["Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6269017/6112774/6112774-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stas Goferman received the BSc degree (summa cum laude) in electrical engineering from the Technion in 2001.

We employ the Generic Elastic Model (GEM) approach, which elastically deforms a generic 3D depth-map based on the sparse observations of an input face image in order to estimate the depth of the face image. Particularly, we show that Gender and Ethnicity specific GEMs (GE-GEMs) can approximate the 3D shape of the input face image more accurately, achieving a better generalization of 3D face modeling and reconstruction compared to the original GEM approach. We qualitatively validate our method using publicly available databases by showing each reconstructed 3D shape generated from a single image and new synthesized poses of the same person at arbitrary angles. For quantitative comparisons, we compare our synthesized results against 3D scanned data and also perform face recognition using synthesized images generated from a single enrollment frontal image. We obtain promising results for handling pose and expression changes based on the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gender and Ethnicity Specific Generic Elastic Models from a Single 2D Image for Novel 2D Pose Face Synthesis and Recognition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.275","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6332439/06112777.pdf","startPage":"2341","endPage":"2350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6332439","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112777","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112777/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Gender and Ethnicity Specific Generic Elastic Models from a Single 2D Image for Novel 2D Pose Face Synthesis and Recognition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"34","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6112777/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"13056958","pubMedId":"22201062","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gender and Ethnicity Specific Generic Elastic Models from a Single 2D Image for Novel 2D Pose Face Synthesis and Recognition","sourcePdf":"ttp2012122341.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129555S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6332439","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6332439","articleId":"6112777","onlineDate":"27 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6112780,"authors":[{"name":"Soma Biswas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6269017/6112780/6112780-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Soma Biswas received the BE degree in electrical engineering from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 2001, the MTech degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, in 2004, and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 2009.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for matching low-resolution probe images with higher resolution gallery images, which are often available during enrollment, using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). The ideal scenario is when both the probe and gallery images are of high enough resolution to discriminate across different subjects. The proposed method simultaneously embeds the low-resolution probe images and the high-resolution gallery images in a common space such that the distance between them in the transformed space approximates the distance had both the images been of high resolution. The two mappings are learned simultaneously from high-resolution training images using an iterative majorization algorithm. Extensive evaluation of the proposed approach on the Multi-PIE data set with probe image resolution as low as 8 \u00d7 6 pixels illustrates the usefulness of the method. We show that the proposed approach improves the matching performance significantly as compared to performing matching in the low-resolution domain or using super-resolution techniques to obtain a higher resolution test image prior to recognition. Experiments on low-resolution surveillance images from the Surveillance Cameras Face Database further highlight the effectiveness of the approach.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2011.278","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/6269017/06112780.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2011.278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6269017","startPage":"2019","endPage":"2030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional Scaling for Matching Low-Resolution Face Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional Scaling for Matching Low-Resolution Face Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112780/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"34","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","pubMedId":"22201067","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6112780/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional Scaling for Matching Low-Resolution Face Images","sourcePdf":"ttp2012102019.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069342S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6269017","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6269017","articleId":"6112780","onlineDate":"27 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6112783,"authors":[{"name":"Davide Falessi","affiliation":["Certus Software V&V Center, Simula Research Laboratory, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/6397557/6112783/6112783-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Davide Falessi received the PhD and the \u201cLaurea\u201d degrees in computer and information engineering from the University of Rome \u201cTorVergata.\u201d He is working as an adjunct research scientist in the Certus Software V&V Center at the Simula Research Laboratory, Norway, and as an adjunct lecturer at the Department of Informatics, Systems, and Production engineering (DISP) of the University of Rome \u201cTor Vergata.\u201d Currently, he serves as a program committee member for several international conferences and workshops, including ESEM, WICSA, SPLC, ICSR, SEKE, PROFES, SHARK, and QMSPLE.

Past research focused on supporting analysts with techniques based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify candidate links. Because many NLP techniques exist and their performance varies according to context, it is crucial to define and use reliable evaluation procedures. The aim of this paper is to propose a set of seven principles for evaluating the performance of NLP techniques in identifying equivalent requirements. In this paper, we conjecture, and verify, that NLP techniques perform on a given dataset according to both ability and the odds of identifying equivalent requirements correctly. For instance, when the odds of identifying equivalent requirements are very high, then it is reasonable to expect that NLP techniques will result in good performance. Our key idea is to measure this random factor of the specific dataset(s) in use and then adjust the observed performance accordingly. To support the application of the principles we report their practical application to a case study that evaluates the performance of a large number of NLP techniques for identifying equivalent requirements in the context of an Italian company in the defense and aerospace domain. The current application context is the evaluation of NLP techniques to identify equivalent requirements. However, most of the proposed principles seem applicable to evaluating any estimation technique aimed at supporting a binary decision (e.g., equivalent/nonequivalent), with the estimate in the range [0,1] (e.g., the similarity provided by the NLP), when the dataset(s) is used as a benchmark (i.e., testbed), independently of the type of estimator (i.e., requirements text) and of the estimation method (e.g., NLP).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112783/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","dateOfInsertion":"28 December 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"13190874","htmlLink":"/document/6112783/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"39","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Empirical Principles and an Industrial Case Study in Retrieving Equivalent Requirements via Natural Language Processing Techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Empirical Principles and an Industrial Case Study in Retrieving Equivalent Requirements via Natural Language Processing Techniques","sourcePdf":"tts2013010018.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153503S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"6397557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6397557","articleId":"6112783","onlineDate":"27 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6112786,"authors":[{"name":"Kirill V.

As digital numbers (DNs) of stable light images are often saturated in the center of city areas, we developed a saturated light correction method for the DMSP/OLS stable light image using the nighttime radiance calibration image of the DMSP/OLS. The comparison between the nonsaturated part of the stable light image for 1999 and the radiance calibration image for 1996-1997 in major areas of Japan showed a strong linear correlation (\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</i>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n = 92.73) between the DNs of both images. Saturated DNs of the stable light image could therefore be corrected based on the correlation equation between the two images. To evaluate the new saturated light correction method, a regression analysis is performed between statistic data of electric power consumption from lighting and the cumulative DNs of the stable light image before and after correcting for the saturation effects by the new method, in comparison to the conventional method, which is, the cubic regression equation method.

The resolution in the elevation direction depends on the elevation aperture size, i.e., on the spread of orbit tracks. Since the orbits of modern meter-resolution spaceborne SAR systems, such as TerraSAR-X, are tightly controlled, the tomographic elevation resolution is at least an order of magnitude lower than in range and azimuth. Hence, super-resolution (SR) reconstruction algorithms are desired. Considering the sparsity of the signal in elevation, a compressive sensing based super-resolving algorithm, named \u201cScale-down by L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n norm Minimization, Model selection, and Estimation Reconstruction\u201d (SL1MMER, pronounced \u201cslimmer\u201d), was proposed by the authors in a previous paper. The ultimate bounds of the technique on localization accuracy and SR power were investigated. In this paper, the essential role of SR for layover separation in urban infrastructure monitoring is indicated by geometric and statistical analysis. It is shown that double scatterers with small elevation distances are more frequent than those with large elevation distances. Furthermore, the SR capability of SL1MMER is demonstrated using TerraSAR-X real data examples. For a high rise building complex, the percentage of detected double scatterers is almost doubled compared to classical linear estimators. Among them, half of the detected double scatterer pairs have elevation distances smaller than the Rayleigh elevation resolution. This confirms the importance of SR for this type of applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112799/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","volume":"50","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"12866529","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6112799/","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of Super-Resolution for Tomographic SAR Imaging in Urban Environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of Super-Resolution for Tomographic SAR Imaging in Urban Environment","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhu-2177843-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050505S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6243179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6243179","articleId":"6112799","onlineDate":"27 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6112802,"authors":[{"name":"Qing He","affiliation":["Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6301724/6112802/6112802-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qing He received the B.S.E. and M.S.E. degrees in computer engineering from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 1999 and 2008, respectively.

These methods regard the perpendicular feet on back-projection lines as the measurements of a 3-D point, since these feet are close to the 3-D point. And then the methods utilize the distance between 3-D point and camera and error propagation rules to adjust the weights of the feet. Finally, the weighted average of these feet is taken as the final estimation for the 3-D point. They are easy to implement, and can be used in both biocular systems and multiocular systems. Especially, as these methods have closed-form solutions, their errors can be predicted by using error propagation rules. Experiments show that they are faster and more accurate than iterative methods and their error covariance matrix can be exactly predicted.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112802/","volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6112802/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"12982075","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Simple 3-D Point Reconstruction Methods With Accuracy Prediction for Multiocular System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple 3-D Point Reconstruction Methods With Accuracy Prediction for Multiocular System","sourcePdf":"tmech-hu-2178423-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087991S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6301724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6301724","articleId":"6112802","onlineDate":"27 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6112804,"authors":[{"name":"Nathana\u00ebl Jarrasse","affiliation":["Institut des Syst\u00e9mes Intelligents et de Robotique, CNRS-UMR 7222, University Pierre et Marie Curie, University of Paris VI, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/6210446/6112804/6112804-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nathanael Jarrass\u00e9 received the graduate degree in industrial systems engineering from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'Arts et M\u00e9tiers, Paris, France, in 2006, and the Master of Science degree in mechanics and system engineering in 2006, along with the Ph.D. degree in robotics in 2010 from the University Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris.","He is now a Researcher with CNRS-ISIR, Paris, as well as a Visiting Researcher with the Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London, London, U.K. His research interests include rehabilitation robotics, kinetostatic analysis, physical human\u2013robot interaction, interaction control, movement analysis, and transparency."]},"firstName":"Nathana\u00ebl","lastName":"Jarrasse","id":"38324251300"},{"name":"Guillaume Morel","affiliation":["Institut des Syst\u00e9mes Intelligents et de Robotique, CNRS-UMR 7222, University Pierre et Marie Curie, University of Paris VI, Paris, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/6210446/6112804/6112804-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Guillaume Morel received the M.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Ph.D. degree in mechanical engineering from the University Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France, in 1990 and 1994, respectively.","After doing postdoctoral research with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, and a first Assistant Professorship at the Universit\u00e9 Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, he came back to Paris in 2001.

Indeed, using an embedment at each connection point leads to uncontrollable forces at the interaction port, induced by hyperstaticity. In practice, these forces may be large because in general the human limb kinematics and the exoskeleton kinematics differ. To cope with hyperstaticity, the literature suggests the addition of passive mechanisms inside the mechanism loops. However, empirical solutions that are proposed so far lack proper analysis and generality. In this paper, we study the general problem of connecting two similar kinematic chains through multiple passive mechanisms. We derive a constructive method that allows the determination of all the possible distributions of freed degrees of freedom across different fixation mechanisms. It also provides formal proofs of global isostaticity. Practical usefulness is illustrated through two examples with conclusive experimental results: a preliminary study made on a manikin with an arm exoskeleton controlling the movement (passive mode) and a larger campaign on ten healthy subjects performing pointing tasks with a transparent robot (active mode).","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2011.2178151","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/6210446/06112804.pdf","startPage":"697","endPage":"709","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2011.2178151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6210446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connecting a Human Limb to an Exoskeleton","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112804/","displayDocTitle":"Connecting a Human Limb to an Exoskeleton","volume":"28","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12769203","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6112804/","dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connecting a Human Limb to an Exoskeleton","sourcePdf":"tro-jarrasse-2178151-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072624S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"6210446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"6210446","articleId":"6112804","onlineDate":"27 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6112805,"authors":[{"name":"Ana-Maria Cretu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/6198838/6112805/6112805-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ana-Maria Cretu (S'04\u2013M'10) received the M.A.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.","She is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa.

Measurements corresponding to the interaction force at the level of the fingertips and to the position of the fingertips of a three-finger robotic hand are associated with the contours of a deformed object tracked in a series of images using neural-network approaches. The resulting model captures the behavior of the object and is able to predict its behavior for previously unseen interactions without any assumption on the object's material. The availability of such models can contribute to the improvement of a robotic hand controller, therefore allowing more accurate and stable grasp while providing more elaborate manipulation capabilities for deformable objects. Experiments performed for different objects, made of various materials, reveal that the method accurately captures and predicts the object's shape deformation while the object is submitted to external forces applied by the robot fingers. The proposed method is also fast and insensitive to severe contour deformations, as well as to smooth changes in lighting, contrast, and background.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2176115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/6198838/06112805.pdf","startPage":"740","endPage":"753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2176115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6198838","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft Object Deformation Monitoring and Learning for Model-Based Robotic Hand Manipulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112805/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","displayDocTitle":"Soft Object Deformation Monitoring and Learning for Model-Based Robotic Hand Manipulation","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12713261","pubMedId":"22207640","htmlLink":"/document/6112805/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 May 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Object Deformation Monitoring and Learning for Model-Based Robotic Hand Manipulation","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-cretu-2176115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114819S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"6198838","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6198838","articleId":"6112805","onlineDate":"27 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6112807,"authors":[{"name":"Vaiman","lastName":"Vaiman","id":"37087998606"},{"name":"Bell","lastName":"Bell","id":"37088000192"},{"name":"Chen","lastName":"Chen","id":"37087998179"},{"name":"Chowdhury","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37087979074"},{"name":"Dobson","lastName":"Dobson","id":"37087997993"},{"name":"Hines","lastName":"Hines","id":"37087998445"},{"name":"Papic","lastName":"Papic","id":"37088000487"},{"name":"Miller","lastName":"Miller","id":"37087998904"},{"name":"Zhang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37087997874"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8950"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0679"}],"articleNumber":"6112807","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":250,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4072},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112807","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system faults","Power system protection","Risk management","Generators","Computational modeling","Data models","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system reliability","power system simulation","risk management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["risk assessment","cascading outage","cascading failure","IEEE PES computer analytical methods subcommittee","power system analysis","power system simulation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cascading failure","power transmission system reliability","preventing cascades","risk analysis","sequential contingency analysis"]}],"abstract":"Cascading outages can cause large blackouts, and a variety of methods are emerging to study this challenging topic.

OFDM has many advantages in terms of resilience to fading, reflections etc. The correct OFDM synchronization enables the error rates to be kept to a minimum, whereas if the system is not accurately synchronized, then errors will result and the system will become less effective. This present Schmidl and Cox algorithm as a symbol timing synchronization algorithm for an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system is implemented to make OFDM as a complete synchronization system. This algorithm is based on the preamble structure defined in IEEE 802.16d. The algorithm improves the characteristic of timing metric by adding the preamble's structure. In this method the sequences of the receiver and the second OFDM sign sequence of the long preamble are made cross-correlation. Finally the peak value is observed. Simulation results show that the timing will be more accurate when compared with other conventional approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112101/6112808/06112831.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"82","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2011.16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2011.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112831","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Symbol Timing Synchronization Algorithm for WiMAX OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","WiMAX","Receivers","Correlation","Frequency synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","synchronisation","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WiMAX OFDM","symbol timing synchronization algorithm","radio communication systems","OFDM synchronization","error rates","Schmidl-Cox algorithm","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","IEEE 802.16d","OFDM sign sequence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WiMAX","Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","synchronization","Schmidl and Cox algorithm","preamble"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112831/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Symbol Timing Synchronization Algorithm for WiMAX OFDM","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6112831/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461642","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Symbol Timing Synchronization Algorithm for WiMAX OFDM","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"4587a078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043881S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112101","isNumber":"6112808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112101","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6112808","articleId":"6112831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6112835,"authors":[{"name":"Khyati R.

The predominant interference operator in the proposed quantum inspired genetic algorithm (QIGA) is influenced by time averages of different random chaotic map models derived from the randomness of quantum mechanical systems. Subsequently, QIGA uses quantum inspired crossover and mutation on the trial solutions, followed by a quantum measurement on the intermediate states, to derive sought results. Application of QIGA to determine optimum threshold intensities is demonstrated on two real life gray level images. The efficacy of QIGA is adjudged w.r.t. a convex combination of two fuzzy thresholding evaluation metrics in a multiple criterion scenario.

This paper has been devoted to improve image compression at low lower no of iterations and higher pixel values. The numerical analysis of such algorithms is carried out by measuring Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Compression Ratio (CR) and CPU processing time. In this paper we have elaborated about the compression ratio with different no iterations. We can evaluate the higher compression ratio results more effectively with lower iteration and higher pixel values than that of quality of image respectively. Image quality will be degraded at higher iteration but compression ratio is better as compare to other algorithms. Different no of iterations and quantized matrix and variable block size are chosen using FDCT for calculating MSE, PSNR and Compression Ratio for achieving the highest image quality and Compression Ratio under the same algorithm. The proposed algorithm significantly raises the PSNR and minimizes the MSE at lower iterations but as above discussion main theory is that Compression Ratio increases at higher iterations and quality of image will not be maintained at higher iterations. We have also calculated the CPU processing time for processing of image compression to find the complexity of algorithm. We have Tested this algorithm two test Images fruit with 512 \u00d7 512 pixel frame and Lena image with 256 \u00d7 256 pixel frames. Thus, we can also conclude that at the same compression ratio the difference between original and decompressed image goes on decreasing, as there is increase in image resolution.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112101/6112808/06112846.pdf","startPage":"158","endPage":"162","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2011.31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2011.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimized Fast Discrete Cosine Transform Approach with Various Iterations and Optimum Numerical Factors for Image Quality Evaluation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Discrete cosine transforms","Quantization","PSNR","Transform coding","Image quality","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","discrete cosine transforms","image coding","image resolution","iterative methods","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast discrete cosine transform approach","image quality evaluation","quantization","iteration","peak signal-to-noise ratio","compression ratio","image resolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["fast discrete cosine transform (FDCT)","mean square error (MSE)","peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR)","compression ratio (CR)","pixel frames","iterations","CPU processing time"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An Optimized Fast Discrete Cosine Transform Approach with Various Iterations and Optimum Numerical Factors for Image Quality Evaluation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6112846/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461657","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimized Fast Discrete Cosine Transform Approach with Various Iterations and Optimum Numerical Factors for Image Quality Evaluation","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"4587a158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085252S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112101","isNumber":"6112808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112101","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6112808","articleId":"6112846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6112847,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Kumar Gupta","affiliation":["MCA Department, K I E T, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Amit Kumar","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37085616789"},{"name":"Yash Pal Singh","affiliation":["CSE Deptt, BIET, Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Yash Pal","lastName":"Singh","id":"37708497200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4587-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2033-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6112847","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112847","abstract":"This paper aims that analysing neural network method in pattern recognition.

Existing techniques such as Misuse detection methods identify packets that match a known pattern or signature. However, these methods fail to detect unknown anomalies. Hence, anomaly detection methods were used to identify the traffic patterns that deviate from the modeled normal traffic behavior. The identified anomalies could be either an attack or normal traffic. The focus in this paper is to monitor the resources of remote server and to detect the malicious traffic. This led to two contributions in this paper. First is the design and implementation of Remote server monitoring (REONIT) tool and the second is the confirmation of attacks by neural ensemble. Local and remote server resources are monitored through REONIT. The REONIT has been implemented using the existing ideas and has the following components, viz., Authentication port let to monitor the distributed resources, Web Port let, which processes requests and generates dynamic content, RRD tool for data storage and visualization, XML for data representation in the form of graphs, and Message Alert, which warns the victim server if any eccentric traffic pattern occurs. REONIT tool was deployed in SSE Test bed* and the resources were monitored. The results were displayed as graphs. From the results, it is confirmed that the anomalous behavior and the high resource utilization observed in the display were due to attacks and not due to legitimate traffic.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Portals","Computer crime","Web servers","Virtual private networks","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","computerised monitoring","data visualisation","file servers","Internet","neural nets","telecommunication traffic","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","REONIT","attack confirmation","neural ensemble","vulnerability assessment tools","Internet","information security breaches","misuse detection methods","malicious traffic","remote server monitoring tool","Web Portlet","authentication portlet","RRDtool","data storage","data visualization","XML","data representation","message alert","eccentric traffic pattern","SSE testbed"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Remote Server Monitoring","Ensemble of classifiers"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2011.39","startPage":"197","endPage":"201","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112101/6112808/06112854.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2011.39","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection Using REONIT and Attack Confirmation by Neural Ensemble","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection Using REONIT and Attack Confirmation by Neural Ensemble","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12461665","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6112854/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection Using REONIT and Attack Confirmation by Neural Ensemble","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"4587a197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082351S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112101","isNumber":"6112808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112101","xplore-issue":"6112808","articleId":"6112854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6112859,"authors":[{"name":"Manzoor Ahmad Lone","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University, Rajouri, Jammu and Kashmir, India"],"firstName":"Manzoor Ahmad","lastName":"Lone","id":"38232024400"},{"name":"S.M.

It is the problem of searching a face in reference database to find the matches as a given face. The purpose is to find a face that has highest similarity with a given face in the database. Many face recognition algorithms have been developed and used as an application of access control and surveillance. For enhancing the performance and accuracy of biometric face recognition system, we use a multi-algorithmic approach, where in a combination of four different individual face recognition techniques is used. In this paper, we develop a face recognition systems based on one combination of four individual techniques namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Template Matching using Correlation (Corr) and Partitioned Iterative Function System (PIFS). We fuse the scores of all of these four techniques in a single face recognition system. We perform a comparative study of face recognition rate of this face recognition system at two precision levels namely at Top-5 and at Top-10 IDs. We experiment it with a standard ORL face database. Experimentally, we find that recognition rate by PCA-DCT technique is better than by individual PCA and DCT techniques and recognition rate by PCA-DCT-Corr technique is better than the PCA-DCT technique. Overall, we find the system based on combination of all of the four individual techniques outperforms.","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2011.44","startPage":"222","endPage":"226","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2011.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112808","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112101/6112808/06112859.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Face Recognition System by Combining Four Individual Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112859/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic Face Recognition System by Combining Four Individual Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6112859/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12461670","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Face Recognition System by Combining Four Individual Algorithms","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"4587a222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083594S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112101","isNumber":"6112808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112101","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6112808","articleId":"6112859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6112860,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Katariya","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Sri Balaji College of Engineering and Technology, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Katariya","id":"37706290700"},{"name":"Amita Yadav","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Sri Balaji College of Engineering and Technology, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Amita","lastName":"Yadav","id":"38233465700"},{"name":"Neha Jain","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Sri Balaji College of Engineering and Technology, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Neha","lastName":"Jain","id":"38242316600"},{"name":"Dr. Geetam Tomar","affiliation":["MIR Laboratory, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Dr. Geetam","lastName":"Tomar","id":"37297331200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4587-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2033-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6112860","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":903},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112860","abstract":"Removed.","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2011.45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2011.45","startPage":"227","endPage":"232","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112101/6112808/06112860.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Removal: BER Comparison of RS and BCH Coded OFDM Transmission over Noisy Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112860/","xploreNote":"Document Removed From IEEE Xplore: This document has been removed from IEEE Xplore as this conference has chosen to implement IEEE's policy on non-presented papers as per section 8.2.1.B.13 of IEEE's \"Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual\".

The end to end devices like mobiles, handheld and palm size PC's have limited capability for computation, display capacity and bandwidth. This augment, for ways for communicating large data files like video, in highly compressed and acceptable quality over the limited available bandwidth. Block matching algorithms is a vital step for achieving the efficient and acceptable compression. The block matching algorithm defines the total computation cost and effective bit budget. Recently fast search algorithm for video coding using Orthogonal Logarithmic Search Algorithm (OSA) has been proposed This paper presents a novel method named as Modified Three steps and Diamond search Block matching Algorithm (MTSSDS) for the block based motion estimation It has been found that from the original Three step Search (3SS/TSS ) and Diamond Search (DS) method, the PSNR value has increased and the computations and thus computation time (faster) has been reduced significantely. The experimental results based on the number of video sequences were presented to demonstrate the advantages of proposed motion estimation technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112101/6112808/06112890.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"366","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2011.77","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2011.77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112808","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Motion Estimation Using Modified New Block Matching Algorithm: MTSSDS for Efficient Video Compression in Mobile Domain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Motion estimation","Diamond-like carbon","Signal processing algorithms","PSNR","Search problems","Bit rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","image sequences","mobile computing","motion estimation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","video compression","mobile domain","video coding","orthogonal logarithmic search algorithm","modified three steps and diamond search block matching algorithm","video sequences"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Block-Matching","Motion estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fast Motion Estimation Using Modified New Block Matching Algorithm: MTSSDS for Efficient Video Compression in Mobile Domain","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461701","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Motion Estimation Using Modified New Block Matching Algorithm: MTSSDS for Efficient Video Compression in Mobile Domain","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"4587a363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032622S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","isNumber":"6112808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112101","articleId":"6112890","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6112899,"authors":[{"name":"Manish Bansal","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Engineering, Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India"],"firstName":"Manish","lastName":"Bansal","id":"38242113400"},{"name":"Sangeeta Nakhate","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Engineering, Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India"],"firstName":"Sangeeta","lastName":"Nakhate","id":"38232791700"},{"name":"Ajay Somkuwar","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Engineering, Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology, Bhopal, India"],"firstName":"Ajay","lastName":"Somkuwar","id":"37662372400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-4587-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2033-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6112899","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1070},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Arrays","Delay","Digital signal processing","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipeline arithmetic","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signed multiplication","radix-32 modified Booth algorithm","Wallace tree structure","VHDL code","hardware description language","Xilinx ISE 9.2i","Model Sim PE Student Edition","digital signal processing","pipelined signed multiplier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radix-32","Booth Encoder","3:2 Compressor","4:2 Compressor","Wallace Tree"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CICN.2011.86","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112101/6112808/06112899.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2011.86","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6112899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Performance Pipelined Signed 64x64-Bit Multiplier Using Radix-32 Modified Booth Algorithm and Wallace Structure","abstract":"This paper manly focus on enhancing speed performance of signed multiplication using radix-32 modified Booth algorithm and Wallace Structure.

MAGIC is used as two-dimensional CAD layout tool. Also PSPICE is used for electrical simulation purposes employed by extraction tool. Feature size is taken from mSCN3M_SUBM.30 process for 0.6\u03bcm layout and 0.5\u03bcm enhanced fabrication process. The improved design has area of 101\u03bb\u00d748\u03bb (minimized from 126\u03bb\u00d759\u03bb) or 30.3\u03bcm\u00d715\u03bcm (minimized from 37.8\u03bcm\u00d717.7\u03bcm) in 0.6\u03bcm CMOS design process. For multi-die placement, two sets of chip are designed those are placed on the four sub-dies in a single MOSIS tiny chip die. For one set of chip coincidence detector is designed to make the mirror-amplifier ultra precise, buffer stage is designed for another set of chip to drive large load.

This process involves decision to change lanes followed by the actual lane change. The lane change trajectory is, thus, influenced by neighborhood traffic conditions and driver's behavior and perception. However, most of the existing lane change models do not consider the uncertainties and human behavior involved in lane change maneuver. In the present paper, neural network is used to predict the lane change trajectory to reflect these uncertainties and perceptions to represent lane changing behavior more realistically. The neural network is employed to perform short term and long range prediction of the Lane change trajectories of a vehicle. The network is first trained using past trajectory of the lane changing vehicles and other vehicles in its neighborhood. The trained network is then used for prediction. The comparison of simulated results with observed data indicates that neural network is able to learn the driver behavior more realistically than other standard modeling and is able to perform short term prediction with sufficient accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2011.120","startPage":"559","endPage":"564","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2011.120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112808","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112101/6112808/06112931.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based lane change trajectory predictions for collision prevention","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112931/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based lane change trajectory predictions for collision prevention","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12461742","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based lane change trajectory predictions for collision prevention","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"4587a559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063551S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","isNumber":"6112808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112101","citationCount":"5","articleId":"6112931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6112935,"authors":[{"name":"Saurabh Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Raj kumar Goel Institute of Technology, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085529107"},{"name":"Rajesh Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Raj kumar Goel Institute of Technology, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, India"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085381713"},{"name":"B.K.

Real-time signal processing requires high speed and high throughput Multiplier-Accumulator (MAC) unit that consumes low power, which is always a key to achieve a high performance digital signal processing system. In this paper, design of MAC unit is proposed. The multiplier used inside the MAC unit is based on the Sutra \"Urdhva Tiryagbhyam\" (Vertically and Cross wise) which is one of the Sutras of Vedic mathematics. Vedic mathematics is mainly based on sixteen Sutras and was rediscovered in early twentieth century. In ancient India, this Sutra was traditionally used for decimal number multiplications within less time. The same concept is applied for multiplication of binary numbers to make it useful in the digital hardware. Here, the coding is done in VHDL and synthesis is done in Xilinx ISE series. The combinational delay obtained after synthesis is compared with the performance of the \"Modified Booth Wallace Multiplier\" and \"High speed Vedic multiplier\" presented by Ramesh Pushpangadam. Our proposed Vedic multiplier seems to have better performance.","doi":"10.1109/CICN.2011.167","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112101/6112808/06112972.pdf","startPage":"754","endPage":"757","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICN.2011.167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6112808","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vedic Mathematics Based Multiply Accumulate Unit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Vedic Mathematics Based Multiply Accumulate Unit","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12461783","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6112972/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6112972/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vedic Mathematics Based Multiply Accumulate Unit","confLoc":"Gwalior, India","sourcePdf":"4587a754.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062774S","chronDate":"7-9 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112101","isNumber":"6112808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112101","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6112808","articleId":"6112972","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6112973,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

However, this does not solve the problem since each user is only likely to know a tiny fraction of other users, we must have methods for inferring trust - and distrust - between users who do not know one another. In this paper, we present a new method for computing both trust and distrust (i.e., positive and negative trust). We do this by combining an inference algorithm that relies on a probabilistic interpretation of trust based on random graphs with a modified spring-embedding algorithm. Our algorithm correctly classifies hidden trust edges as positive or negative with high accuracy. These results are useful in a wide range of social web applications where trust is important to user behavior and satisfaction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113143/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6113143/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12525413","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Predicting Trust and Distrust in Social Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting Trust and Distrust in Social Networks","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"4578a418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09471S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112285","isNumber":"6113084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112285","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"6113084","articleId":"6113143","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6113199,"authors":[{"name":"Justin Zhan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina A&T State University, Greensboro, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Zhan","id":"37067630900"},{"name":"Xing Fang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, North Carolina A&T State University, Greensboro, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Xing","lastName":"Fang","id":"37713826400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1931-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4578-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6113199","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"abstract":"Anomaly detection has been intensively studied in a variety of research fields, including system and network intrusion detections, fraud detections, etc. Current anomaly detection techniques vastly focus on the detection of the anomalous data. This type of approach could be efficient for the sake of system and network intrusion detection. However, for the social related fraud detection, it is not thorough enough for only applying such approach. One reason is that the ignored social or economic environment can directly affect consumers, who can also be the impersonators. Thereby, in this paper, based on the assumption in microeconomics that every single individual can be treated as a consumer, we propose a novel anomaly detection model via social-economic computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the pioneer research for anomaly detection in social-economic computing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Third International Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2011 IEEE Third International Conference on Social Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112285/6113084/06113199.pdf","startPage":"695","endPage":"703","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Third International Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2011 IEEE Third International Conference on Social Computing","doi":"10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.234","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Social-Economic Computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microeconomics","Neurons","Artificial neural networks","Training data","Clustering algorithms","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microeconomics","security of data","socio-economic effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["social-economic computing","fraud detection","microeconomics","anomaly detection model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","fraud","microeconomics","social-economic computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection in Social-Economic Computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6113199/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12525465","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection in Social-Economic Computing","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"4578a695.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083829S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112285","isNumber":"6113084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112285","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6113084","articleId":"6113199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6113200,"authors":[{"name":"Su Yang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Su","lastName":"Yang","id":"37279520100"},{"name":"Wenbin Zhou","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wenbin","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37709461800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1931-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4578-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6113200","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":339},"abstract":"Some special natural and social events like natural disasters, terrorism attacks, and traffic accidents may have remarkable effect on people's collective behaviors, which means the behaviors of a large number of people viewed as a whole. Analysis of the patterns of collective behaviors in the sense of data mining is an important topic. Solving this problem is crucial and practical in that online detection of abnormal patterns of people's collective behaviors may lead to rapid response to emergent affairs. In terms of technology, the task can be regarded as detection of abnormal particle movement patterns from a global point of view. In this study, we propose a solution to solve this problem. First, the traffic flows observed by more than 4000 sensors are organized as high-dimensional time series. Second, a widely used manifold learning technique referred to as locally linear embedding (LLE) is used to compute the K coefficients in fitting every data point with its K nearest neighbors in the high-dimensional s ce, which can be regarded as a K-dimensional local feature associated with every data point. Then, the local features of the data points within a time window are summarized by using principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain a global feature to represent the traffic data in every time window. Finally, outlier detection is performed on such PCALLE feature space. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect abnormal traffic patterns, which correspond with some special days, like the New Year day, the national day of America, and some days with extreme weather.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Third International Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2011 IEEE Third International Conference on Social Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112285/6113084/06113200.pdf","startPage":"704","endPage":"707","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Third International Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2011 IEEE Third International Conference on Social Computing","doi":"10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomaly Detection on Collective Moving Patterns: Manifold Learning Based Analysis of Traffic Streams","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Manifolds","Principal component analysis","Data mining","Detectors","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","data analysis","data mining","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern clustering","pattern recognition","principal component analysis","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","collective moving patterns","manifold learning based analysis","traffic streams","natural events","social events","natural disaster","terrorism attack","traffic accident","pattern analysis","collective behavior","data mining","abnormal pattern online detection","abnormal particle movement pattern","traffic flow","high-dimensional time series","locally linear embedding","K nearest neighbor","K-dimensional local feature","time window","principal component analysis","outlier detection","PCALLE feature space","abnormal traffic pattern","New Year day","National Day of America","extreme weather days"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Collective Behaviors","Outlier Detection","Traffic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Anomaly Detection on Collective Moving Patterns: Manifold Learning Based Analysis of Traffic Streams","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6113200/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12525466","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","conferenceDate":"9-11 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomaly Detection on Collective Moving Patterns: Manifold Learning Based Analysis of Traffic Streams","confLoc":"Boston, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"4578a704.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083515S","chronDate":"9-11 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112285","isNumber":"6113084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112285","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6113084","articleId":"6113200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6113241,"authors":[{"name":"Jannik Dreier","affiliation":["CNRS, Verimag, Universit\u00e9 Grenoble 1, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Jannik","lastName":"Dreier","id":"38233374100"},{"name":"Florian Kerschbaum","affiliation":["SAP Research, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Kerschbaum","id":"37270288200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1931-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4578-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6113241","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Supply chains","Cryptography","Protocols","Linear matrix inequalities","Planning","Linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","data privacy","linear programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy-preserving multiparty linear programming","problem transformation","cryptographic solutions","leakage quantification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Privacy","Linear Programming","Supply Chain Management","Collaboration","Outsourcing","Cloud Computing","Leakage Quantification","Secure Multi-Party Computation"]}],"abstract":"Cryptographic solutions to privacy-preserving multiparty linear programming are slow.

Yet the time variability by the coefficients in those dynamic regression models is possibly indicative of whether anomalies are in the data set on which the ARIMA model builds. Thus we introduce a corresponding framework and a novel anomaly detection method that combines the Kalman filter for identifying the parameters of those dynamic models with a General Likelihood Ratio (GLR) test that is based on the former for detecting suspicious changes in the parameters and therefore the models.

Within the system, users are identified by public-keys only. An attacker wishing to de-anonymize its users will attempt to construct the one to-many mapping between users and public-keys and associate information external to the system with the users. Bitcoinfrustrates this attack by storing the mapping of a user to his or her public-keys on that user's node only and by allowing each user to generate as many public-keys as required. In this paper we consider the topological structure of two networks derived from Bitcoin's public transaction history. We show that the two networks have a non-trivial topological structure, provide complementary views of the Bitcoin system and have implications for anonymity. We combine these structures with external information and techniques such as context discovery and flow analysis to investigate an alleged theft of Bitcoins, which, at the time of the theft, had a market value of approximately half a million U.S. dollars.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Public key","History","Peer to peer computing","IP networks","Context","Educational

The simulation conclusions show the performance of MPPT algorithm becomes much precise and active with the help of fuzzy control and artificial neural network.","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2011.56","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112294/6113191/06113398.pdf","startPage":"230","endPage":"233","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference of Information Technology, Computer Engineering and Management Sciences","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference of Information Technology, Computer Engineering and Management Sciences","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2011.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MPPT of Solar Energy Generating System with Fuzzy Control and Artificial Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113398/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"MPPT of Solar Energy Generating System with Fuzzy Control and Artificial Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12508429","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6113398/","conferenceDate":"24-25 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MPPT of Solar Energy Generating System with Fuzzy Control and Artificial Neural Network","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"4522a230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084157S","chronDate":"24-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112294","isNumber":"6113191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112294","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6113191","articleId":"6113398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6113424,"authors":[{"name":"Xuhao Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Xuhao","lastName":"Chen","id":"38239046400"},{"name":"Jiawen Li","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jiawen","lastName":"Li","id":"38240418900"},{"name":"Zhong Zheng","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37858598700"},{"name":"Li Shen","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Shen","id":"37287404400"},{"name":"Zhiying Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhiying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37279253800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1419-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6113424","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113424","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Benchmark testing","Instruction sets","Hardware","Scalability","Multicore processing","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","multiprocessing systems","multi-threading","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["emerging multithreaded application","commodity multicore server","out-of-date benchmark","real commodity CMP machine","CMP benchmark suite","PARSEC","cache sharing","memory bandwidth","hardware manufacturer","system software designer","scalable parallel system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["chip multiprocessor","multithreaded application","cache sharing","memory bandwidth"]}],"abstract":"The performance of multithreaded applications is often limited by resources such as shared cache and memory bandwidth. Several prior studies have examined this issue, but most of them have been constrained by the use of simulators and out-of-date benchmarks. In this work, we conduct an experiment on real commodity CMP machines, using a recently released CMP benchmark suite, PARSEC, to investigate the influence of cache sharing and memory bandwidth on the scalability of emerging parallel applications. The results reveal that the behavioral characteristics of these benchmarks. We find that the shared cache and memory bandwidth are indeed the bottlenecks for some of these applications.

Then generate synthetic samples by samples in different class when different classes cross seriously. In addition, increase weights of part positive samples, which may be not on borderline.

It has widely application prospects which can not only increase the transmission rate and the capacity of the wireless communication system, but also effectively resist multi-path fading as well as restrain interference and noise. The Simulink toolbox in Matlab is used to set up a simulation model for OFDM communication system simulation, the scatter Plot and SNR curve are also given based on the established model. The simulation results indicate that, in the same symbol rate and the same Eb/N0 case, QPSK bit error rate is lower than 16QAM, QPSK has a better performance than 16QAM. When transmission rate is the same, 16QAM is higher than QPSK in the rate of information transmission. When the SNR is increased, the channel estimation algorithm for OFDM system is lower bit error rate much than that of without channel estimation algorithm for BER.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference of Information Technology, Computer Engineering and Management Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112294/6113446/06113471.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"75","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference of Information Technology, Computer Engineering and Management Sciences","doi":"10.1109/ICM.2011.138","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICM.2011.138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Reception for OFDM Communication Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Phase shift keying","Communication systems","Channel estimation","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","fading channels","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM communication systems","reception performance analysis","high-speed data flow","low-speed data flow","orthogonal narrowband subchannel","wireless communication system","multipath fading","Simulink toolbox","Matlab simulation model","QPSK bit error rate","16QAM","channel estimation algorithm","BER","symbol rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","simulink","LS","multi-path fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113471/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-25 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Reception for OFDM Communication Systems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6113471/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12508489","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"24-25 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Reception for OFDM Communication Systems","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"4522b072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072816S","chronDate":"24-25 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112294","isNumber":"6113446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112294","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6113446","articleId":"6113471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6113472,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-lan Chen","affiliation":["Wuhan Mechanical Technology College, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yu-lan","lastName":"Chen","id":"38241577000"},{"name":"Ling Zhu","affiliation":["Wuhan Mechanical Technology College, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38238091700"},{"name":"Han-yan Huang","affiliation":["Wuhan Mechanical Technology College, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Han-yan","lastName":"Huang","id":"38237490200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1419-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4522-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6113472","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"abstract":"With the development of the space industry in China, the demands for transmit rate from satellites to receivers on the ground is getting higher and higher.

Shadow tags that duplicate entire private cache tag arrays are widely used to minimize area overhead, but require an energy-intensive associative search to obtain the sharing information. Recent research proposed a Tagless directory, which uses bloom filters to summarize the tags in a cache set. The Tagless directory associates the sharing vector with the bloom filter buckets to completely eliminate the associative lookup and reduce the directory overhead. However, Tagless still uses a full map sharing vector to represent the sharing information, resulting in remaining area and energy challenges with increasing core counts. In this paper, we first show that due to the regular nature of applications, many bloom filters essentially replicate the same sharing pattern. We next exploit the pattern commonality and propose SPATL (Sharing-pattern based Tagless Directory). SPATL exploits the sharing pattern commonality to decouple the sharing patterns from the bloom filters and eliminates the redundant copies of sharing patterns. SPATL works with both inclusive and noninclusive shared caches and provides 34% storage savings over Tagless, the previous most storage-efficient directory, at 16 cores. We study multiple strategies to periodically eliminate the false sharing that comes from combining sharing pattern compression with Tagless, and demonstrate that SPATL can achieve the same level of false sharers as Tagless with 5% extra bandwidth. Finally, we demonstrate that SPATL scales even better than an idealized directory and can support 1024-core chips with less than 1% of the private cache space for data parallel applications.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.10","startPage":"33","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113786.pdf","endPage":"44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.10","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113786/","displayDocTitle":"SPATL: Honey, I Shrunk the Coherence Directory","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6113786/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12461861","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SPATL: Honey, I Shrunk the Coherence Directory","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094684S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6113790,"authors":[{"name":"Sungpack Hong","affiliation":["Pervasive Parallelism Laboratory, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Sungpack","lastName":"Hong","id":"37597661500"},{"name":"Tayo Oguntebi","affiliation":["Pervasive Parallelism Laboratory, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Tayo","lastName":"Oguntebi","id":"37590899400"},{"name":"Kunle Olukotun","affiliation":["Pervasive Parallelism Laboratory, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Kunle","lastName":"Olukotun","id":"37282353900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1794-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4566-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-795X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1089-795X"}],"articleNumber":"6113790","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":153,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2426},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113790","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Arrays","Bandwidth","Parallel processing","Proposals","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","graph theory","multiprocessing systems","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel graph exploration","data representation","multicore CPU","multicore GPU","graphics processing unit","breadth-first search","parallel BFS algorithm","memory bandwidth","multicore execution","GPU execution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graph","BFS","GPU","Multi-Core CPU"]}],"abstract":"Graphs are a fundamental data representation that has been used extensively in various domains.

By utilizing memory bandwidth more efficiently, our method shows improved performance over the current state-of-the-art implementation and increases its advantage as the size of the graph increases. We then propose a hybrid method which, for each level of the BFS algorithm, dynamically chooses the best implementation from: a sequential execution, two different methods of multicore execution, and a GPU execution. Such a hybrid approach provides the best performance for each graph size while avoiding poor worst-case performance on high-diameter graphs. Finally, we study the effects of the underlying architecture on BFS performance by comparing multiple CPU and GPU systems, a high-end GPU system performed as well as a quad-socket high-end CPU system.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.14","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113790.pdf","startPage":"78","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Parallel Graph Exploration on Multi-Core CPU and GPU","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Parallel Graph Exploration on Multi-Core CPU and GPU","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6113790/","accessionNumber":"12461865","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Parallel Graph Exploration on Multi-Core CPU and GPU","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08874S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","citationCount":"153","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6113791,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin J.

However, targeting these emerging devices often requires using multiple disparate programming models and making decisions that can limit forward scalability. In previous work we proposed the use of domain-specific languages (DSLs) to provide high-level abstractions that enable transformations to high performance parallel code without degrading programmer productivity. In this paper we present a new end-to-end system for building, compiling, and executing DSL applications on parallel heterogeneous hardware, the Delite Compiler Framework and Runtime. The framework lifts embedded DSL applications to an intermediate representation (IR), performs generic, parallel, and domain-specific optimizations, and generates an execution graph that targets multiple heterogeneous hardware devices. Finally we present results comparing the performance of several machine learning applications written in OptiML, a DSL for machine learning that utilizes Delite, to C++ and MATLAB implementations. We find that the implicitly parallel OptiML applications achieve single-threaded performance comparable to C++ and outperform explicitly parallel MATLAB in nearly all cases.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.15","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113791.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Heterogeneous Parallel Framework for Domain-Specific Languages","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113791/","displayDocTitle":"A Heterogeneous Parallel Framework for Domain-Specific Languages","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461866","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6113791/","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Heterogeneous Parallel Framework for Domain-Specific Languages","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097267S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6113792,"authors":[{"name":"Ganesh Dasika","affiliation":["ARM R and D, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ganesh","lastName":"Dasika","id":"37428258500"},{"name":"Ankit Sethia","affiliation":["Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"Sethia","id":"38233232000"},{"name":"Trevor Mudge","affiliation":["Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Mudge","id":"37267150400"},{"name":"Scott Mahlke","affiliation":["Advanced Computer Architecture Laboratory, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Mahlke","id":"37265029800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1794-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4566-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-795X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1089-795X"}],"articleNumber":"6113792","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":370},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prefetching","Graphics processing unit","Benchmark testing","Computer architecture","Pipelines","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","graphics processing units","laptop computers","parallel machines","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-efficient processor","scientific computing","graphics processing unit","GPU","general programming models","desktop supercomputer","high-end laptop computer","PEPSC architecture","single-instruction multiple-data data path","SIMD data path","intelligent dynamic prefetching mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low power","SIMD","GPGPU","Throughput computing","Scientific computing"]}],"abstract":"The rapid advancements in the computational capabilities of the graphics processing unit (GPU) as well as the deployment of general programming models for these devices have made the vision of a desktop supercomputer a reality. It is now possible to assemble a system that provides several TFLOPs of performance on scientific applications for the cost of a high-end laptop computer. While these devices have clearly changed the landscape of computing, there are two central problems that arise. First, GPUs are designed and optimized for graphics applications resulting in delivered performance that is far below peak for more general scientific and mathematical applications. Second, GPUs are power hungry devices that often consume 100-300 watts, which restricts the scalability of the solution and requires expensive cooling. To combat these challenges, this paper presents the PEPSC architecture - an architecture customized for the domain of data parallel scientific applications where power-efficiency is the central focus. PEPSC utilizes a combination of a two-dimensional single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) data path, an intelligent dynamic prefetching mechanism, and a configurable SIMD control approach to increase execution efficiency over conventional GPUs. A single PEPSC core has a peak performance of 120 GFLOPs while consuming 2W of power when executing modern scientific applications, which represents an increase in computation efficiency of more than 10X over existing GPUs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PEPSC: A Power-Efficient Processor for Scientific Computing","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.16","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113792.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"PEPSC: A Power-Efficient Processor for Scientific Computing","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6113792/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461867","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PEPSC: A Power-Efficient Processor for Scientific Computing","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05781S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6113793,"authors":[{"name":"Jungseob Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Jungseob","lastName":"Lee","id":"37065076400"},{"name":"Vijay Sathisha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Sathisha","id":"38233196500"},{"name":"Michael Schulte","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Schulte","id":"37273849400"},{"name":"Katherine Compton","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Katherine","lastName":"Compton","id":"37299340000"},{"name":"Nam Sung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"firstName":"Nam Sung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37404885800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1794-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4566-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-795X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1089-795X"}],"articleNumber":"6113793","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":1301},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Graphics processing unit","System-on-a-chip","Bandwidth","Power demand","Memory management","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","graphics processing units","parallel processing","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["throughput improvement","power-constrained GPU","dynamic voltage-frequency scaling","core scaling","graphic processing units","parallel applications","on-chip interconnects","on-chip caches","off-chip memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU","dynamic voltage","frequency","core scaling","power constraint","throughput"]}],"abstract":"State-of-the-art graphic processing units (GPUs) can offer very high computational throughput for highly parallel applications using hundreds of integrated cores.

Although the throughput can be increased with more cores for some applications, it cannot for others because parallelism of applications and/or bandwidth of on-chip interconnects/caches and off-chip memory are limited. In this paper, first, we demonstrate that adjusting the number of operating cores and the voltage/frequency of cores and/or on-chip interconnects/caches for different applications can improve the throughput of GPUs under a power constraint.

Many-core architectures, such as the Single-chip Cloud Computer (SCC) experimental processor from Intel Labs, have DVFS infrastructures that scale by having many more independent voltage and frequency domains on-die than today's multi-cores. This paper proposes a novel, hierarchical, and transparent client-server power management scheme applicable to such architectures. The scheme tries to minimize energy consumption within a performance window taking into consideration not only the local information for cores within frequency domains but also information that spans multiple frequency and voltage domains. We implement our proposed hierarchical power control using a novel application-driven phase detection and prediction approach for Message Passing Interface (MPI) applications, a natural choice on the SCC with its fast on-chip network and its non-coherent memory hierarchy. This phase predictor operates as the front-end to the hierarchical DVFS controller, providing the necessary DVFS scheduling points. Experimental results with SCC hardware show that our approach provides significant improvement of the Energy Delay Product (EDP) of as much as 27.2%, and 11.4% on average, with an average increase in execution time of 7.7% over a baseline version without DVFS. These improvements come from both improved phase prediction accuracy and more effective DVFS control of the domains, compared to existing approaches.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase-Based Application-Driven Hierarchical Power Management on the Single-chip Cloud Computer","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.19","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113795.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Phase-Based Application-Driven Hierarchical Power Management on the Single-chip Cloud Computer","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6113795/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461870","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase-Based Application-Driven Hierarchical Power Management on the Single-chip Cloud Computer","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129421S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6113797,"authors":[{"name":"Byn Choi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Byn","lastName":"Choi","id":"37675390000"},{"name":"Rakesh Komuravelli","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Rakesh","lastName":"Komuravelli","id":"38233213600"},{"name":"Hyojin Sung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Hyojin","lastName":"Sung","id":"38237507800"},{"name":"Robert Smolinski","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Smolinski","id":"38233217400"},{"name":"Nima Honarmand","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Nima","lastName":"Honarmand","id":"37294502700"},{"name":"Sarita V.

This software evolution is a rare opportunity for hardware designers to rethink hardware from the ground up to exploit opportunities exposed by such disciplined software models. Such a co-designed effort is more likely to achieve many-core scalability than a software-oblivious hardware evolution. This paper presents DeNovo, a hardware architecture motivated by these observations. We show how a disciplined parallel programming model greatly simplifies cache coherence and consistency, while enabling a more efficient communication and cache architecture. The DeNovo coherence protocol is simple because it eliminates transient states - verification using model checking shows 15X fewer reachable states than a state-of-the-art implementation of the conventional MESI protocol. The DeNovo protocol is also more extensible. Adding two sophisticated optimizations, flexible communication granularity and direct cache-to-cache transfers, did not introduce additional protocol states (unlike MESI). Finally, DeNovo shows better cache hit rates and network traffic, translating to better performance and energy. Overall, a disciplined shared-memory programming model allows DeNovo to seamlessly integrate message passing-like interactions within a global address space for improved design complexity, performance, and efficiency.","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","startPage":"155","endPage":"166","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.21","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.21","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113797.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DeNovo: Rethinking the Memory Hierarchy for Disciplined Parallelism","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113797/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"DeNovo: Rethinking the Memory Hierarchy for Disciplined Parallelism","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461872","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6113797/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DeNovo: Rethinking the Memory Hierarchy for Disciplined Parallelism","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a155.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121136S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6113801,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, George Washington University, Washington DC, DC, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Xu","id":"38238256700"},{"name":"Man-Lap Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, George Washington University, Washington DC, DC, USA"],"firstName":"Man-Lap","lastName":"Li","id":"37557968100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1794-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4566-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-795X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1089-795X"}],"articleNumber":"6113801","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113801","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Registers","Fault tolerance","Microprocessors","Fault tolerant systems","Integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CriticalFault framework","soft error effect","vulnerability-driven injection","microprocessors","cross-layer hardware-software reliability solution","statistical fault injection","fault-tolerant mechanism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault Injection","Vulnerability","Microarchitecture","Soft Error"]}],"abstract":"As future microprocessors will be prone to various types of errors, researchers have looked into cross-layer hardware-software reliability solutions to reduce overheads. These mechanisms are shown to be effective when evaluated with statistical fault injection (SFI). However, under SFI, a large number of injected faults can be derated, making the evaluation less rigorous. To handle this problem, we propose a biased fault injection framework called Ciritical Fault that leverages vulnerability analysis to identify faults that are more likely to stress test the underlying reliability solution. Our experimental results show that the injection space is reduced by 30% and a large portion of injected faults cause software aborts and silent data corruptions. Overall, Critical Fault allows us to amplify soft error effects on reliability mechanism-under-test, which can help improve current techniques or inspire other new fault-tolerant mechanisms.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.25","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113801.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"174","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CriticalFault: Amplifying Soft Error Effect Using Vulnerability-Driven Injection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"CriticalFault: Amplifying Soft Error Effect Using Vulnerability-Driven Injection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6113801/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461876","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113801/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CriticalFault: Amplifying Soft Error Effect Using Vulnerability-Driven Injection","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0315S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6113806,"authors":[{"name":"Manu Awasthi","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Utah, USA"],"firstName":"Manu","lastName":"Awasthi","id":"38189974900"},{"name":"David W.

Traditional methods for exploiting locality at the DRAM level, such as open-page and timer-based policies, become less effective as the number of threads accessing memory increases. Employing closed-page policies in such systems can improve performance but it eliminates any possibility of exploiting locality. In this paper, we build upon the key insight that a history-based predictor that tracks the number of accesses to a given DRAM page is a much better indicator of DRAM locality than timer based policies. We extend prior work to propose a simple Access Based Predictor (ABP) that tracks limited access history at the page level to determine page closure decisions, and does so with much smaller storage overhead than previously proposed policies. We show that ABP, with additional optimizations, can improve system throughput by 12.3% and 21.6% over open and closed-page policies, respectively. The proposed ABP requires 20 KB of storage overhead and is outside the critical path of memory access.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.31","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113806.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction Based DRAM Row-Buffer Management in the Many-Core Era","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Prediction Based DRAM Row-Buffer Management in the Many-Core Era","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6113806/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461881","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113806/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction Based DRAM Row-Buffer Management in the Many-Core Era","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037503S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6113809,"authors":[{"name":"Nagendra Gulur","affiliation":["Texas Instrumenits, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Nagendra","lastName":"Gulur","id":"38233084500"},{"name":"R.

However, beyond its use as memory cell, it is challenging to integrate memristor in modern architectures for general purpose computation. In this paper we propose a non-conventional use of memristor and demonstrate its applicability to enhancing cache replacement policy. We design a memristor-based saturation counter which can track cache access history at low cost. Based on our counter design, we develop a cache replacement framework that is both reconfigurable and adaptive (MRAC). Our evaluation demonstrates MRAC's reconfigurability and adaptivity, which result in better performance and more robust performance improvement.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Radiation detectors","History","Computer architecture","Resistance","Microprocessors","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","memristors","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MRAC","memristor-based reconfigurable framework","adaptive cache replacement","nonvolatile memory technologies","memory cell","general purpose computation","memristor-based saturation counter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Memristor","Cache replacement","Application of emerging memory technologies"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113818","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.29","startPage":"207","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113818.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.29","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113818/","displayDocTitle":"MRAC: A Memristor-based Reconfigurable Framework for Adaptive Cache Replacement","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12461892","htmlLink":"/document/6113818/","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MRAC: A Memristor-based Reconfigurable Framework for Adaptive Cache Replacement","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050181S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6113819,"authors":[{"name":"Yingying Tian","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Texas-San Antonio, USA"],"firstName":"Yingying","lastName":"Tian","id":"38001362600"},{"name":"Daniel A.

How- ever, inclusive caches have limited performance due to the fact that all cache blocks in the higher level caches (referred as core caches) should be a subset of the last-level cache (LLC). When the sum of the sizes of the core caches is comparable to that of the LLC, cache performance is poor due to low cache capacity. Moreover, when a cache block is evicted from the LLC, it must be invalidated from all the core caches, referred as an inclusion victim. Nevertheless, due to the fact that temporal locality is hidden by core caches, blocks that have high temporal locality in the core caches tend to become replacement candidates in the LLC. In this case, the highly-accessed blocks in the core caches are evicted from core caches to cause cache misses and harm the cache performance. Based on our experiments, in a 2- core inclusive CMP, 73.57% of inclusion victims will be re-referenced within 4 LI misses in the corresponding sets after their invalidations (4 is the LI cache associativity). It would be promising if there were an inclusive cache management policy that could decrease the number of hot inclusion victims and potentially increase the capacity of the cache hierarchy. Thus, we propose the Sampling Temporal Touch Hint Inclusive Cache Management Policy.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.42","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.42","startPage":"209","endPage":"209","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113819.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling Temporal Touch Hint (STTH) Inclusive Cache Management Policy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Sampling Temporal Touch Hint (STTH) Inclusive Cache Management Policy","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6113819/","accessionNumber":"12461893","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113819/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling Temporal Touch Hint (STTH) Inclusive Cache Management Policy","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a209.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038481S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6113821,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Orozco","affiliation":["University of Delaware, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Orozco","id":"37680104900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1794-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4566-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-795X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1089-795X"}],"articleNumber":"6113821","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":591},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Runtime","Scalability","Computer architecture","Synchronization","Time domain analysis","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data flow computing","data flow graphs","multiprocessing systems","parallel programming","program control structures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TIDeFlow model","parallel execution model","high performance computing programs","parallel programs","sequential memory semantics","serial languages","operating system designers","synchronization operations","many-core architectures","time iterated dependency flow execution model","graph-based model","dataflow models","parallel loops","macro dataflow","dynamic dataflow","directed graphs","task pipelining","task migration","distributed control","Cyclops-64","HT-Queue","concurrent algorithms","runtime system primitives","polytasks","software tools","graph programming model","parallel intermediate representation","distributed runtime system","matrix multiply","FFT","fast Fourier transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dataflow","Dynamic dataflow","Macro dataflow","Parallel execution model","Parallel Runtime Systems","Task Management","Tasking framework","Manycore","Cyclops-64"]}],"abstract":"Summary form only given. The popularity of serial execution paradigms in the High Performance Computing (HPC) field greatly hinders the ability of computational scientists to develop and support massively parallel programs. Programmers are left with languages that are inadequate to express parallel constructs, being forced to take decisions that are not directly related to the programs they write. Computer architects are forced to support sequential memory semantics only because serial languages require them and operating system designers are forced to support slow synchronization operations. This poster addresses the development and execution of HPC programs in many-core architectures by introducing the Time Iterated Dependency Flow (TIDeFlow) execution model. In TIDeFlow, programmers specify the precedence relations between computations without dealing with implementation details related to synchronization or scheduling. TIDeFlow is a graph-based model inspired by dataflow: Computations in a program are expressed as actors whose dependencies are represented by arcs. TIDeFlow departs from other dataflow models (1) in that actors represent parallel loops as the basic building block of HPC programs, (2) in that arcs between actors represent dependencies of any kind (data, control or other) and (3) in that arc weights allow delaying tokens to provide support for pipelining. TIDeFlow is related to other dataflow models (an excellent survey can be found in [1]) in the idea of executing several computations into a single actor as in Macro Dataflow[2] and in allowing multiple, concurrent executions of the same actor through coloring of tokens as in Dynamic Dataflow[3]. The resulting TIDeFlow model expresses HPC programs as directed graphs with weighted nodes and weighted arcs that represent parallel loops and loop carried dependencies respectively. The model is useful to support task pipelining, task migration, and distributed control. An implementation of TIDeFlow was developed for Cyclops- 64[4], a 160-core architecture by IBM. The implementation resulted in new, highly concurrent algorithms-such as the HT-Queue[4]and in development of efficient representation of runtime system primitives such as polytasks[5]. The implementation is supported by a number of software tools including a graph programming model, a parallel intermediate representation form and a fully distributed runtime system. The effectiveness of TIDeFlow was tested using several HPC programs, including FDTD in 1 and 2 dimensions [6], Matrix Multiply, and FFT. In all cases, the programs were run using Cyclops-64, allowing excellent studies in scalability, performance, parallelism and overhead. The results of the experiments, presented in [4] and [5] show that TIDeFlow can efficiently support very fine grained execution due to its very low overhead and its distributed nature. The experiments also show excellent scalability, al- lowing close-to-linear scalability for 156 processors executing matrix multiply. The experiments also showed the advantages for development: Expressing dependencies using a graph was found to be easier than placing hand-coded synchronization constructs inside programs. The performance of the TIDeFlow runtime system was carefully measured, showing that it uses very few clock cycles to create, schedule and terminate tasks. The runtime system is fully distributed and lock-free, allowing runtime operations to be insensible to the load of the system. This poster introduces TIDeFlow by presenting (1) its graph programming model (weighted nodes and wighted arcs), (2) a description of composability in TIDeFlow, which allows the use of programs to build larger programs, (3) a brief description of the TIDeFlow runtime system and (4) a summary of the excellent results obtained, both in scalability and overhead for FDTD in 1 and 2 dimensions, Matrix Multiply, and FFT. This work contributes to the state of the art by: (1) Presenting a new execution model, (2) presenting an overview of the design of a decentralized, fully distributed runtime system, (3) conveying the idea that HPC applications can be efficiently expressed as weighted graphs and (4) showing that common techniques such as double buffering and task pipelining can be an intrinsic part of a programming model rather than a technique used by the programmer.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.44","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113821.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","startPage":"211","endPage":"211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TIDeFlow: A Parallel Execution Model for High Performance Computing Programs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113821","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"TIDeFlow: A Parallel Execution Model for High Performance Computing Programs","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113821/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461895","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6113821/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TIDeFlow: A Parallel Execution Model for High Performance Computing Programs","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042752S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6113836,"authors":[{"name":"Naser Sedaghati","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"firstName":"Naser","lastName":"Sedaghati","id":"38234972900"},{"name":"Renji Thomas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"firstName":"Renji","lastName":"Thomas","id":"38001415200"},{"name":"Louis-No\u00ebl Pouchet","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"firstName":"Louis-No\u00ebl","lastName":"Pouchet","id":"37297752800"},{"name":"Radu Teodorescu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, USA"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Teodorescu","id":"37555988600"},{"name":"P.

The data access pattern of stencil computations often requires several adjacent data elements of arrays to be accessed in innermost parallel loops. Although such loops are vectorized by current compilers like GCC and ICC that target short-vector SIMD instruction sets, a number of redundant loads or additional intra-register data shuffle operations are required, reducing the achievable performance. Thus, even when all arrays are cache resident, the peak performance achieved with stencil computations is considerably lower than machine peak. In this paper, we present a hardware-based solution for this problem. We propose an extension to the standard addressing mode of vector floating-point instructions in ISAs such as SSE, AVX, VMX etc. We propose an extended mode of paired-register addressing and its hardware implementation, to overcome the performance limitation of current short-vector SIMD ISA's for stencil computations. Further, we present a code generation approach that can be used by a vectorizing compiler for processors with such an instructions set. Using an optimistic as well as a pessimistic emulation of the proposed instruction extension, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on top of SSE and AVX capable processors. We also synthesize parts of the proposed design using a 45nm CMOS library and show minimal impact on processor cycle time.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.59","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113836.pdf","startPage":"276","endPage":"287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"StVEC: A Vector Instruction Extension for High Performance Stencil Computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113836/","displayDocTitle":"StVEC: A Vector Instruction Extension for High Performance Stencil Computation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461910","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6113836/","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"StVEC: A Vector Instruction Extension for High Performance Stencil Computation","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127602S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6113839,"authors":[{"name":"Ziyu Guo","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Ziyu","lastName":"Guo","id":"38236371500"},{"name":"Eddy Zheng Zhang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Eddy Zheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37574361000"},{"name":"Xipeng Shen","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, The College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Xipeng","lastName":"Shen","id":"37278603600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1794-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4566-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-795X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1089-795X"}],"articleNumber":"6113839","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":129},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correctly Treating Synchronizations in Compiling Fine-Grained SPMD-Threaded Programs for CPU","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Kernel","Vectors","Programming","Indexes","Systematics","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","program compilers","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fine-grained SPMD-threaded programs","automatic compilation","heterogeneous computing","multicore CPU","systematic dependence analysis","implicit synchronization","inter-thread data dependence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU","CUDA","GPU-to-CPU Translation","Implicit Synchronizations","Dependence Analysis","SPMD-Translation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113839","abstract":"Automatic compilation for multiple types of devices is important, especially given the current trends towards heterogeneous computing.

SIMD machines give application developers a tremendous computational power, however, the model also brings restrictions. In particular, processing elements (PEs) execute in lock-step, and may lose performance due to divergences caused by conditional branches. In face of divergences, some PEs execute, while others wait, this alternation ending when they reach a synchronization point. In this paper we introduce divergence analysis, a static analysis that determines which program variables will have the same values for every PE. This analysis is useful in three different ways: it improves the translation of SIMD code to non-SIMD CPUs, it helps developers to manually improve their SIMD applications, and it also guides the compiler in the optimization of SIMD programs. We demonstrate this last point by introducing branch fusion, a new compiler optimization that identifies, via a gene sequencing algorithm, chains of similarities between divergent program paths, and weaves these paths together as much as possible. Our implementation has been accepted in the Ocelot open-source CUDA compiler, and is publicly available. We have tested it on many industrial-strength GPU benchmarks, including Rodinia and the Nvidia's SDK. Our divergence analysis has a 34% false-positive rate, compared to the results of a dynamic profiler. Our automatic optimization adds a 3% speed-up onto parallel quick sort, a heavily optimized benchmark.

Although vector instructions can deliver high performance, writing vector code in assembly language or using intrinsics in high level languages is a time consuming and error-prone task. The alternative is to automate the process of vectorization by using vectorizing compilers. This paper evaluates how well compilers vectorize a synthetic benchmark consisting of 151 loops, two application from Petascale Application Collaboration Teams (PACT), and eight applications from Media Bench II. We evaluated three compilers: GCC (version 4.7.0), ICC (version 12.0) and XLC (version 11.01). Our results show that despite all the work done in vectorization in the last 40 years 45-71% of the loops in the synthetic benchmark and only a few loops from the real applications are vectorized by the compilers we evaluated.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.68","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113845.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","startPage":"372","endPage":"382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Evaluation of Vectorizing Compilers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Evaluation of Vectorizing Compilers","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113845/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461919","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6113845/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Evaluation of Vectorizing Compilers","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.131761S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6113848,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Fang","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Fang","id":"38231707100"},{"name":"Long Chen","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Iowa State University, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Chen","id":"38240285100"},{"name":"Zhao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Iowa State University, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279632200"},{"name":"Zhichun Zhu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, USA"],"firstName":"Zhichun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37281370900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1794-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4566-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-795X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1089-795X"}],"articleNumber":"6113848","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1851},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Phase change materials","Clocks","Timing","Bridges","Organizations","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","memory architecture","open systems","performance evaluation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory technologies","main memory system design","synchronous DRAM architecture","memory controller","memory devices","PCM","timing requirements","interoperability","general-purpose processors","diverse memory modules","universal memory architecture","local scheduling","memory scalability improvement","power efficiency improvement","bandwidth improvement","DDRx memory bus","performance improvement","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["universal memory architecture","diverse memory modules","emerging memory technology","interoperability"]}],"abstract":"Current main memory system design is severely limited by the decades-old synchronous DRAM architecture, which requires the memory controller to track the internal status of memory devices (chips) and schedule the timing of all device operations. This rigidity has become an obstacle of integrating emerging memory technologies such as PCM into existing memory systems, because their timing requirements are vastly different. Furthermore, with the trend of embedding memory controllers into processors, it is crucial to have interoperability among general-purpose processors and diverse memory modules. To address this issue, we propose a new memory architecture framework called universal memory architecture (UniMA). It enables the interoperability by decoupling the scheduling of device operations from memory controller, using a bridge chip at each memory module to perform local scheduling. The new architecture may also help improve memory scalability, power efficiency, and bandwidth as previously proposed decoupled memory organizations. A major focus of this study is to evaluate the performance impact of local scheduling of device operations. We present a prototype implementation of UniMA on top of DDRx memory bus, and then evaluate its efficiency with different workloads. The simulation results show that UniMA actually improves memory system efficiency for memory-intensive workloads due to increased parallelism among memory modules. The overall performance improvement over the conventional DDRx memory architecture is 3.1% on average. The performance of other workloads is reduced slightly, by 1.0% on average, due to a small increase of memory idle latency. In short, the prototype and evaluation demonstrate that it is possible to integrate diverse memory technologies into a single memory architecture with virtually no loss of overall performance.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.71","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113848.pdf","startPage":"403","endPage":"412","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory Architecture for Integrating Emerging Memory Technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113848/","displayDocTitle":"Memory Architecture for Integrating Emerging Memory Technologies","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6113848/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461922","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory Architecture for Integrating Emerging Memory Technologies","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106148S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6113850,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Hua E.

Alternatively, the regex can be converted to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) for efficient matching, which however may require an extremely large state transition table (STT) due to exponential state explosion [17, 27]. We propose the segmented regex-NFA (SR-NFA) architecture, where the regex is first compiled into modular nondeterministic finite automata (NFA), then partitioned, optimized, and matched efficiently on modern multi-core processors. SR-NFA offers attack-resilient multi-gigabit per second matching throughput, does not suffer from either backtracking or state explosion, and can be rapidly constructed. For regex sets that construct a DFA with moderate state explosion, i.e., on average 200k states in the STT, the proposed SR-NFA is 367k times faster to construct and update and use 23k times less memory than the DFA approach. Running on an 8-core 2.6 GHz Opteron platform, our prototype achieves 2.2 Gbps average matching throughput for regex sets with up to 4,000 SR-NFA states per regex set.","doi":"10.1109/PACT.2011.73","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/6112806/6113772/06113850.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACT.2011.73","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113772","startPage":"424","endPage":"433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Regular Expression Matching with SR-NFA on Multi-Core Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6113850","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Regular Expression Matching with SR-NFA on Multi-Core Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113850/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461924","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6113850/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Regular Expression Matching with SR-NFA on Multi-Core Systems","confLoc":"Galveston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"4566a424.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066207S","chronDate":"10-14 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6112806","isNumber":"6113772","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6112806","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6113772","articleId":"6113850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6113920,"authors":[{"name":"Tushar Deshpande","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Tushar","lastName":"Deshpande","id":"37596671300"},{"name":"Panagiotis Katsaros","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Katsaros","id":"37273271800"},{"name":"Stylianos Basagiannis","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Stylianos","lastName":"Basagiannis","id":"37596660500"},{"name":"Scott A.

We use the PRISM probabilistic model checker to introduce a Continuous Time Markov Chain model of the DNS BAA and three recently proposed countermeasures, and to perform an extensive cost-benefit analysis of the countermeasures. Our analysis, which is applicable to both DNS and DNSSec (a security extension of DNS), is based on objective metrics that weigh the benefits for a server in terms of the percentage increase in the processing of legitimate packets against the cost incurred by incorrectly dropping legitimate traffic. The results we obtain, gleaned from more than 450 PRISM runs, demonstrate significant differences between the countermeasures as reflected by their respective net benefits. Our results also reveal that DNSSec is more vulnerable than DNS to a BAA attack, and, relatedly, DNSSec derives significantly less benefit from the countermeasures.","doi":"10.1109/HASE.2011.57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HASE.2011.57","startPage":"360","endPage":"367","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 13th International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/6113112/6113852/06113920.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 13th International Symposium on High-Assurance Systems Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Formal Analysis of the DNS Bandwidth Amplification Attack and Its Countermeasures Using Probabilistic Model Checking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Formal Analysis of the DNS Bandwidth Amplification Attack and Its Countermeasures Using Probabilistic Model Checking","conferenceDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6113920/","accessionNumber":"12461981","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6113920/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Formal Analysis of the DNS Bandwidth Amplification Attack and Its Countermeasures Using Probabilistic Model Checking","confLoc":"Boca Raton, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4615a360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086273S","chronDate":"10-12 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6113112","isNumber":"6113852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6113112","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6113852","articleId":"6113920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-02"},{"_id":6113934,"authors":[{"name":"Satish C.

Mutual coupling has been a subject of interest in MIMO communications, since it influence the channel matrix, and thus, the capacity of the MIMO system. Although it is a well known subject in antenna theory it has not been studied in as much detail from the MIMO terminals perspective. In this paper the impact of different antenna placements (both position and orientation) inside the MIMO terminal on the mutual coupling between two antenna elements and hence their diversity performance is evaluated and investigated in details. The antenna element employed is a pair of inverted-F antennas (IFAs) working at 3 GHz and is placed in various orthogonal and parallel configuration on a PCB ground plane with dimensions that are comparable with a mobile phone. The optimal position and orientation for the IFA antennas inside the MIMO terminal with low mutual coupling which leads to good diversity performance is addressed. It is found that some configurations are capable of providing high isolation between the IFA array elements. The EM simulation was carried out by using the Computer Simulation Technology (CST) Microwave Studio package, which utilizes the finite integral technique (FIT) for electromagnetic computation.","doi":"10.1109/LAPC.2011.6114014","publicationTitle":"2011 Loughborough Antennas & Propagation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Loughborough Antennas & Propagation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6099901/6113963/06114014.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAPC.2011.6114014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance investigation of a dual element IFA array at 3 GHz for MIMO terminals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114014","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114014/","displayDocTitle":"Performance investigation of a dual element IFA array at 3 GHz for MIMO terminals","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12444432","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114014/","conferenceDate":"14-15 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance investigation of a dual element IFA array at 3 GHz for MIMO terminals","confLoc":"Loughborough, UK","sourcePdf":"m1569447139alnuaimi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049564S","chronDate":"14-15 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6099901","isNumber":"6113963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6099901","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6113963","articleId":"6114014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6114021,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksander Krewski","affiliation":["RheinMain University of Applied Sciences, Ruesselsheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Aleksander","lastName":"Krewski","id":"37540748100"},{"name":"Werner L.

Generated terrain profiles and relative received power plots are presented based on the experimental data. According to the relative received signal, MUSA-MIMO-OFDM uplink channels experience temporal fading. Moreover, the correlation between the relative received power and weather variables are presented. Results show that all weather variables exhibit a negative average correlation with received power. Wind speed records the highest average negative correlation coefficient of -0.35. Local maxima of negative correlation, ranging from 0.49 to 0.78, between the weather variables and relative received signals were registered between 5-6 a.m. The highest measured correlation (-0.78) of this time of the day was exhibited by wind speed.

Within a brand, it is also common for similar hardware architectures to be used, and to be paired with the same operating system. Whilst mathematically trivial in nature, the Transmission Line Matrix (TLM) method is computationally-intensive, and therefore varies in performance dependant on available resources. This paper investigates how the performance of a mobile Computational Electromagnetics (mCEM) laboratory iPhone application is effected when executed on devices with different hardware configurations, but that are available from the same manufacturer. Hardware differences across the chosen platform are first discussed, with performance predictions made based on the device specifications. TLM is suitable for parallel computing implementations, and therefore potential multi-threading optimisation strategies are discussed for applicable devices. Results from the application performance benchmarking are presented, and demonstrated that the iPad 2 offered the best processing performance of the devices tested.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Loughborough Antennas & Propagation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6099901/6113963/06114079.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2011 Loughborough Antennas & Propagation Conference","doi":"10.1109/LAPC.2011.6114079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAPC.2011.6114079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6113963","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benchmarking of a TLM solver on mobile devices sharing a common hardware architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Random access memory","Benchmark testing","Clocks","Hardware","Instruction sets","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational electromagnetics","mobile communication","multi-threading","operating systems (computers)","transmission line matrix methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TLM solver benchmarking","mobile device","hardware architecture","mobile communication device","hardware feature","software feature","operating system","transmission line matrix method","mobile computational electromagnetics laboratory iPhone application","hardware configuration","parallel computing","multithreading optimisation strategy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Benchmarking of a TLM solver on mobile devices sharing a common hardware architecture","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114079/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12444496","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"14-15 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benchmarking of a TLM solver on mobile devices sharing a common hardware architecture","confLoc":"Loughborough, UK","sourcePdf":"m1569471213browne.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040622S","chronDate":"14-15 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6099901","isNumber":"6113963","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6099901","xplore-issue":"6113963","articleId":"6114079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6114092,"authors":[{"name":"Imran Shoaib","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Imran","lastName":"Shoaib","id":"37319039200"},{"name":"Xiaodong Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278211900"},{"name":"Zhinong Ying","affiliation":["Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, Corporate Technology Office, Lund, Sweden"],"firstName":"Zhinong","lastName":"Ying","id":"37305489700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1016-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1014-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1015-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6114092","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":656},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","MIMO","Channel capacity","Antenna radiation patterns","Antenna arrays","Dielectric resonator antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","channel capacity","MIMO communication","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern reconfigurable dielectric resonator antenna array","adaptive MIMO system","multiple-input multiple-output system","horizontal ground plane","radiation pattern reconfiguration","channel capacity","varying channel conditions","ray tracing simulation","indoor environment"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents our latest study on the design of reconfigurable antennas and the performance achievable by employing such antennas in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

The balanced antenna is a simple thin dipole. Using a single external matching circuit and a balun, the antenna can provide three tunable resonant frequencies simultaneously to cover the low band (705 MHz to 951 MHz), mid-band (1692 MHz to 2457 MHz) and high-band (2862 to over 3000 MHz). When combined with a two-port chassis-antenna, which has a wide tuning range, it becomes a reconfigurable MIMO antenna for small terminals. Measurements show that the prototype antenna can tune the operating frequency from 646 MHz to 848 MHz and 1648 MHz to 2074 MHz with instantaneous bandwidths of 14 MHz to 93 MHz.

In the measurement of a monopole antenna with a small ground-plane, the finite-sized ground causes the current to flow back from the radiator to the outer surface of the coaxial cable. This results in secondary radiation which introduces errors to the measured radiation pattern. To reduce the unwanted secondary radiation, the coaxial cable can be covered with EMI suppressant tubing materials. However, this introduces errors to the measured efficiency. In this paper, the models of the coaxial cable with and without suppressant tubing are developed and used for computer simulation. The cable effects on the measured results of a small monopole ultrawide band (UWB) antenna are studied by using the antenna measurement equipment Satimo StarLab and the EM simulation tool CST.

With this trend, parallel programming models need to achieve portability across different processors as well as high performance with reasonable programming effort. OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is an open standard and emerging parallel programming model to write parallel applications for such heterogeneous platforms. In this paper, we characterize the performance of an OpenCL implementation of the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite (NPB) on a heterogeneous parallel platform that consists of general-purpose CPUs and a GPU. We believe that understanding the performance characteristics of conventional workloads, such as the NPB, with an emerging programming model (i.e., OpenCL) is important for developers and researchers to adopt the programming model. We also compare the performance of the NPB in OpenCL to that of the OpenMP version. We describe the process of implementing the NPB in OpenCL and optimizations applied in our implementation. Experimental results and analysis show that the OpenCL version has different characteristics from the OpenMP version on multicore CPUs and exhibits different performance characteristics depending on different OpenCL compute devices. The results also indicate that the application needs to be rewritten or re-optimized for better performance on a different compute device although OpenCL provides source-code portability.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Graphics processing unit","Multicore processing","Indexes","Computational modeling","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled

In this paper, we explore how the highly parallel computational capabilities of commodity graphics processing units (GPUs) can be exploited for high-speed pattern matching. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a pattern matching library running on the GPU, which can be used transparently by a wide range of applications to increase their overall performance. The library supports both string searching and regular expression matching on the NVIDIA CUDA architecture. We have also explored the performance impact of different types of memory hierarchies, and present solutions to alleviate memory congestion problems. The results of our performance evaluation using off-the-self graphics processors demonstrate that GPU-based pattern matching can reach tens of gigabits per second on different workloads.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6107922/6114172/06114181.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"225","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2011.6114181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2011.6114181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114172","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallelization and characterization of pattern matching using GPUs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Pattern matching","Instruction sets","Doped fiber amplifiers","Arrays","Throughput","Automata"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","parallel architectures","pattern matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern matching parallelization","pattern matching characterization","graphics processing unit","high-speed pattern matching","NVIDIA CUDA architecture","string searching","regular expression matching","memory hierarchy","GPU-based pattern matching","compute unified device architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Parallelization and characterization of pattern matching using GPUs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114181/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12460615","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallelization and characterization of pattern matching using GPUs","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"43ParallelizationcharacterizationVasiliadis2080509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087487S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6107922","isNumber":"6114172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6107922","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6114172","articleId":"6114181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":6114182,"authors":[{"name":"Jingweijia Tan","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of Kansas, USA"],"firstName":"Jingweijia","lastName":"Tan","id":"38237267600"},{"name":"Nilanjan Goswami","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Nilanjan","lastName":"Goswami","id":"37587480700"},{"name":"Tao Li","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Florida, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Li","id":"37539272900"},{"name":"Xin Fu","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of Kansas, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Fu","id":"37532127600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2064-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2063-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2062-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6114182","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":811},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Instruction sets","Graphics processing unit","Microarchitecture","Registers","Reliability","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","error statistics","graphics processing units"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-error vulnerability","GPGPU microarchitecture","general-purpose computation","graphic processing unit","computational throughput","data parallel application","error detection","graphics processing","CMOS processing technology","soft error rate","GPGPU reliability","GPGPU-SODA","software dependability analysis","structure vulnerability","workload characteristics","architectural optimization","dynamic warp formation","warp scheduling policy","comprehensive resiliency","GPGPU design"]}],"abstract":"The general-purpose computation on graphic processing units (GPGPU) becomes increasingly popular due to their high computational throughput for data parallel applications. Modern GPU architectures have limited capability for error detection and tolerance since they are originally designed for graphics processing. However, the rigorous execution correctness is required for general-purpose applications. This makes reliability a growing concern in GPGPU architecture design. With CMOS processing technologies continuously scaling down to the nano-scale, on-chip soft error rate (SER) has been predicted to increase exponentially. GPGPUs with hundreds of cores integrated in a single chip are prone to manifest high SER. This paper explores a first step to characterize GPGPU reliability in light of soft errors. We develop GPGPU-SODA (GPGPU Software Dependability Analysis), a framework to estimate the soft-error vulnerability of GPGPU microarchitecture. By using GPGPU-SODA, we observe that several microarchitecture structures in GPGPUs exhibit high soft-error susceptibility, and the structure vulnerability is sensitive to workload characteristics (e.g. branch divergences, memory coalescing). We further investigate several architectural optimizations. We find that both dynamic warp formation and increasing the number of threads supported by GPU largely affect the GPGPU soft-error robustness. However, changing the warp scheduling policy has minor impact on the structure vulnerability. The observations made in this study provide designers the useful guidance to build resilient GPGPUs: a comprehensive resiliency solution for GPGPUs should consider the entire GPGPU design instead of just focusing on a particular structure.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6107922/6114172/06114182.pdf","startPage":"226","endPage":"235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing soft-error vulnerability on GPGPU microarchitecture","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2011.6114182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2011.6114182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing soft-error vulnerability on GPGPU microarchitecture","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12460616","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6114182/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing soft-error vulnerability on GPGPU microarchitecture","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"44Analyzingtan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063373S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6107922","isNumber":"6114172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6107922","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6114172","articleId":"6114182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6114195,"authors":[{"name":"Wim Heirman","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Information Systems, Ghent University, Belgium"],"firstName":"Wim","lastName":"Heirman","id":"37298036500"},{"name":"Trevor E.

A cycle stack quantifies where the cycles have gone, and provides hints towards optimization opportunities. We make the case that this is particularly interesting for analyzing parallel performance: understanding how cycle components scale with increasing core counts and/or input data set sizes leads to insight with respect to scaling bottlenecks due to synchronization, load imbalance, poor memory performance, etc. We present several case studies illustrating the use of cycle stacks. As a subsequent step, we further extend the methodology to analyze sets of parallel workloads using statistical data analysis, and perform a workload characterization to understand behavioral differences across benchmark suites. We analyze the SPLASH-2, PARSEC and Rodinia benchmark suites and conclude that the three benchmark suites cover similar areas in the workload space. However, scaling behavior of these benchmarks towards larger input sets and/or higher core counts is highly dependent on the benchmark, the way in which the inputs have been scaled, and on the machine configuration.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114195/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12460622","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114195/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Using cycle stacks to understand scaling bottlenecks in multi-threaded workloads","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using cycle stacks to understand scaling bottlenecks in multi-threaded workloads","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"14UsingcycleHeirman2082007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11653S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6107922","isNumber":"6114172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6107922","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6114172","articleId":"6114195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6114198,"authors":[{"name":"Mitesh R.

Given this rapid market growth, it is important that mobile system designers and computer architects analyze the characteristics of the interactive applications users have come to expect on these platforms. With the introduction of high-performance, low-power, general purpose CPUs in the latest smartphone models, users now expect PC-like performance and a rich user experience, including high-definition audio and video, high-quality multimedia, dynamic web content, responsive user interfaces, and 3D graphics. In this paper, we characterize the microarchitectural behavior of representative smartphone applications on a current-generation mobile platform to identify trends that might impact future designs. To this end, we measure a suite of widely available mobile applications for audio, video, and interactive gaming. To complete this suite we developed BBench, a new fully-automated benchmark to assess a web-browser's performance when rendering some of the most popular and complex sites on the web. We contrast these applications' characteristics with those of the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite. We demonstrate that real-world interactive smartphone applications differ markedly from the SPEC suite. Specifically the instruction cache, instruction TLB, and branch predictor suffer from poor performance. We conjecture that this is due to the applications' reliance on numerous high level software abstractions (shared libraries and OS services). Similar trends have been observed for UI-intensive interactive applications on the desktop.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2011.6114205","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6107922/6114172/06114205.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2011.6114205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114172","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-system analysis and characterization of interactive smartphone applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114205","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114205/","displayDocTitle":"Full-system analysis and characterization of interactive smartphone applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12460632","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114205/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-system analysis and characterization of interactive smartphone applications","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"27FullSystemAnalysisGutierrez2082223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053212S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6107922","isNumber":"6114172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6107922","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6114172","articleId":"6114205","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6114206,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Clemons","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Clemons","id":"37949725800"},{"name":"Haishan Zhu","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Haishan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38237573500"},{"name":"Silvio Savarese","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Silvio","lastName":"Savarese","id":"37298502600"},{"name":"Todd Austin","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Todd","lastName":"Austin","id":"37267010600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2064-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2063-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2062-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6114206","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":889},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Benchmark testing","Mobile communication","Computer vision","Vectors","Support vector machines","Augmented reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","embedded systems","face recognition","feature extraction","image classification","mobile computing","object recognition","object tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MEVBench application","mobile computer vision benchmarking suite","augmented reality","object recognition","embedded platform","face detection","feature classification","object tracking","feature extraction","embedded systems"]}],"abstract":"The growth in mobile vision applications, coupled with the performance limitations of mobile platforms, has led to a growing need to understand computer vision applications. Computationally intensive mobile vision applications, such as augmented reality or object recognition, place significant performance and power demands on existing embedded platforms, often leading to degraded application quality. With a better understanding of this growing application space, it will be possible to more effectively optimize future embedded platforms. In this work, we introduce and evaluate a custom benchmark suite for mobile embedded vision applications named MEVBench. MEVBench provides a wide range of mobile vision applications such as face detection, feature classification, object tracking and feature extraction. To better understand mobile vision processing characteristics at the architectural level, we analyze single and multithread implementations of many algorithms to evaluate performance, scalability, and memory characteristics. We provide insights into the major areas where architecture can improve the performance of these applications in embedded systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MEVBench: A mobile computer vision benchmarking suite","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2011.6114206","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6107922/6114172/06114206.pdf","startPage":"91","endPage":"102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2011.6114206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114172","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114206","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"MEVBench: A mobile computer vision benchmarking suite","conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114206/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12460633","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MEVBench: A mobile computer vision benchmarking suite","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"28MEVBenchAClemons2082201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067927S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6107922","isNumber":"6114172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6107922","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6114172","articleId":"6114206","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6114208,"authors":[{"name":"Kishore Kumar Pusukuri","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California Riverside, Riverside, USA"],"firstName":"Kishore Kumar","lastName":"Pusukuri","id":"38233600000"},{"name":"Rajiv Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California Riverside, Riverside, USA"],"firstName":"Rajiv","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37272679200"},{"name":"Laxmi N.

While this may be true for systems with four or eight cores, this is not true for systems with larger number of cores. Our experiments with PARSEC programs on a 24-core machine demonstrate this. Therefore, dynamically determining the appropriate number of threads for a multithreaded application is an important unsolved problem. In this paper we develop a simple technique for dynamically determining appropriate number of threads without recompiling the application or using complex compilation techniques or modifying Operating System policies. We first present a scalability study of eight programs from PARSEC conducted on a 24 core Dell PowerEdge R905 server running OpenSolaris.2009.06 for numbers of threads ranging from a few threads to 128 threads. Our study shows that not only does the maximum speedup achieved by these programs vary widely (from 3.6x to 21.9x), the number of threads that produce maximum speedups also vary widely (from 16 to 63 threads). By understanding the overall speedup behavior of these programs we identify the critical Operating System level factors that explain why the speedups vary with the number of threads. As an application of these observations, we develop a framework called \u201cThread Reinforcer\u201d that dynamically monitors program's execution to search for the number of threads that are likely to yield best speedups. Thread Reinforcer identifies optimal or near optimal number of threads for most of the PARSEC programs studied and as well as for SPEC OMP and PBZIP2 programs.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2011.6114208","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6107922/6114172/06114208.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2011.6114208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114172","startPage":"116","endPage":"125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thread reinforcer: Dynamically determining number of threads via OS level monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Thread reinforcer: Dynamically determining number of threads via OS level monitoring","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114208/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12460635","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6114208/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thread reinforcer: Dynamically determining number of threads via OS level monitoring","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"31ThreadReinforcerPusukuri2075983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094697S","chronDate":"6-8 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6107922","isNumber":"6114172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6107922","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"6114172","articleId":"6114208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6114256,"authors":[{"name":"Arjuna Madanayake","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Akron, Akron, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6209393/6114256/6114256-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Arjuna Madanayake (M'03) received the B.S. degree in electronic and telecommunication engineering (with first class honors) from the University of Moratuwa, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","He is currently a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the University of Akron, Akron, OH.

The architecture directly realizes an error-free 2-D DCT without using FRSs between row-column transforms, leading to an 8 \u00d7 8 2-D DCT that is entirely free of quantization errors in AI basis. As a result, the user-selectable accuracy for each of the coefficients in the FRS facilitates each of the 64 coefficients to have its precision set independently of others, avoiding the leakage of quantization noise between channels as is the case for published DCT designs. The proposed FRS uses two approaches based on: 1) optimized Dempster-Macleod multipliers, and 2) expansion factor scaling. This architecture enables low-noise high-dynamic range applications in digital video processing that requires full control of the finite-precision computation of the 2-D DCT. The proposed architectures and FRS techniques are experimentally verified and validated using hardware implementations that are physically realized and verified on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. Six designs, for 4-bit and 8-bit input word sizes, using the two proposed FRS schemes, have been designed, simulated, physically implemented, and measured. The maximum clock rate and block rate achieved among 8-bit input designs are 307.787 MHz and 38.47 MHz, respectively, implying a pixel rate of 8 \u00d7 307.787\u22482.462 GHz if eventually embedded in a real- time video-processing system. The equivalent frame rate is about 1187.35Hz for the image size of 1920 \u00d7 1080.

Our aim is to quantify the performance gains and therefore, to determine whether this benefit, compared to the cost associated to the channels implementation and maintenance, is such as to justify the additional channels. We first analyse the impact on the non-minimum phase zeros (including zeros at infinity) when we add input channels. Then, we compute the associated change on the best achievable performance, as measured by a quadratic index. We compute explicit expressions for the difference between the best achievable performance in the control of the original square and the resulting fat systems. As expected, our results show that the impact of adding input channels is related to the non-minimum phase zeros that are removed as a consequence of adding additional input channels.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114280","startPage":"106","endPage":"111","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Australian Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6107924/6114280/06114295.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the impact on MIMO zeros and achievable performance of adding additional input channels to square MIMO discrete-time systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-11 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6114295/","displayDocTitle":"On the impact on MIMO zeros and achievable performance of adding additional input channels to square MIMO discrete-time systems","conferenceDate":"10-11 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461160","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the impact on MIMO zeros and achievable performance of adding additional input channels to square MIMO discrete-time systems","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"0024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066761S","chronDate":"10-11 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6107924","isNumber":"6114280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6107924","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6114280","articleId":"6114295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ENGINEERS AUSTRALIA & AUSTRALIAN OPTICAL","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6114303,"authors":[{"name":"H.

microstructures. To develop engineering materials with the expected properties, predicting patterns in solidified metals would be indispensable. The phase-field simulation is the most powerful method known to simulate the micro-scale dendritic growth during solidification in a binary alloy. To evaluate the realistic description of solidification, however, phase-field simulation requires computing a large number of complex nonlinear terms over a fine-grained grid. Due to such heavy computational demand, previous work on simulating three-dimensional solidification with phase-field methods was successful only in describing simple shapes. Our new simulation techniques achieved scales unprecedentedly large, sufficient for handling complex dendritic structures required in material science. Our simulations on the GPU-rich TSUBAME 2.0 super- computer at the Tokyo Institute of Technology have demonstrated good weak scaling and achieved 1.017 PFlops in single precision for our largest configuration, using 4,000 CPUs along with 16,000 CPU cores.","doi":"10.1145/2063384.2063388","publicationTitle":"SC '11: Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '11: Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105609/6114389/06114394.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2063384.2063388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114389","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peta-scale phase-field simulation for dendritic solidification on the TSUBAME 2.0 supercomputer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114394","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Peta-scale phase-field simulation for dendritic solidification on the TSUBAME 2.0 supercomputer","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114394/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12493757","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6114394/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peta-scale phase-field simulation for dendritic solidification on the TSUBAME 2.0 supercomputer","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"gb113s4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09265S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105609","isNumber":"6114389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105609","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6114389","articleId":"6114394","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6114398,"authors":[{"name":"Trevor E.

Fast and scalable simulations are therefore needed to allow for sufficient exploration of large multi-core systems within a limited simulation time budget. By bringing together accurate high-abstraction analytical models with fast parallel simulation, architects can trade off accuracy with simulation speed to allow for longer application runs, covering a larger portion of the hardware design space. Interval simulation provides this balance between detailed cycle-accurate simulation and one-IPC simulation, allowing long-running simulations to be modeled much faster than with detailed cycle-accurate simulation, while still providing the detail necessary to observe core-uncore interactions across the entire system. Validations against real hardware show average absolute errors within 25% for a variety of multi-threaded workloads; more than twice as accurate on average as one-IPC simulation. Further, we demonstrate scalable simulation speed of up to 2.0 MIPS when simulating a 16-core system on an 8-core SMP machine.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114398/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114398/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12493761","conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sniper: Exploring the level of abstraction for scalable and accurate parallel multi-core simulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sniper: Exploring the level of abstraction for scalable and accurate parallel multi-core simulation","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"pap111s4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088794S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105609","isNumber":"6114389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105609","citationCount":"279","xplore-issue":"6114389","articleId":"6114398","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6114402,"authors":[{"name":"Karthik Ganesan","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Texas, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Ganesan","id":"38180095800"},{"name":"Lizy K.

Previous research efforts towards automating the power virus generation process are all limited to the single core processors and are not effective when applied to multicore parallel systems as the components like the interconnection network, shared caches, DRAM and coherence directory also contribute significantly to the power consumption of a multicore parallel system. In this paper we propose MAximum Multicore POwer (MAMPO), which is the pioneer attempt towards a framework to automatically generate a multithreaded power virus for a given multicore parallel system configuration. We show that the the power viruses generated by MAMPO consume 40% to 89% more power than running multiple copies of single-core power viruses like MPrime torture test and the most recent published previous work called SYMPO on 3 different parallel multicore system configurations.

Current techniques to ensure progress across faults, like checkpoint-restart, are increasingly problematic at these scales due to excessive overheads predicted to more than double an application's time to solution. Replicated computing techniques, particularly state machine replication, long used in distributed and mission critical systems, have been suggested as an alternative to checkpoint-restart. In this paper, we evaluate the viability of using state machine replication as the primary fault tolerance mechanism for upcoming exascale systems. We use a combination of modeling, empirical analysis, and simulation to study the costs and benefits of this approach in comparison to check-point/restart on a wide range of system parameters. These results, which cover different failure distributions, hardware mean time to failures, and I/O bandwidths, show that state machine replication is a potentially useful technique for meeting the fault tolerance demands of HPC applications on future exascale platforms.","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '11: Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105609/6114389/06114406.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"SC '11: Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","doi":"10.1145/2063384.2063443","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2063384.2063443","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating the viability of process replication reliability for exascale systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Hardware","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Computer crashes","Sockets","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["checkpointing","distributed processing","fault tolerant computing","finite state machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["process replication reliability","exascale systems","high-end computing machines","checkpoint-restart","replicated computing techniques","state machine replication","mission critical systems","distributed systems","fault tolerance mechanism","failure distribution","HPC applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114406/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the viability of process replication reliability for exascale systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114406/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12493769","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating the viability of process replication reliability for exascale systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"pap161s4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083309S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105609","isNumber":"6114389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105609","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6114389","articleId":"6114406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6114408,"authors":[{"name":"\u00cd\u00f1igo Goiri","affiliation":["BSC, UPC and Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"\u00cd\u00f1igo","lastName":"Goiri","id":"38233755700"},{"name":"Ryan Beauchea","affiliation":["Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Beauchea","id":"38233759600"},{"name":"Kien Le","affiliation":["Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Kien","lastName":"Le","id":"37722778900"},{"name":"Thu D.

GreenSlot predicts the amount of solar energy that will be available in the near future, and schedules the workload to maximize the green energy consumption while meet- ing the jobs' deadlines. If grid energy must be used to avoid dead- line violations, the scheduler selects times when it is cheap. Our results for production scientific workloads demonstrate that Green-Slot can increase green energy consumption by up to 117% and decrease energy cost by up to 39%, compared to a conventional scheduler. Based on these positive results, we conclude that green datacenters and green-energy-aware scheduling can have a significant role in building a more sustainable IT ecosystem.","doi":"10.1145/2063384.2063411","publicationTitle":"SC '11: Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '11: Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105609/6114389/06114408.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/2063384.2063411","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114389","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GreenSlot: Scheduling energy consumption in green datacenters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GreenSlot: Scheduling energy consumption in green datacenters","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114408/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12493771","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6114408/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GreenSlot: Scheduling energy consumption in green datacenters","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"pap167s4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069745S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105609","isNumber":"6114389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105609","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"6114389","articleId":"6114408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6114412,"authors":[{"name":"Jens Krueger","affiliation":["Computational Research Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA","Fraunhofer ITWM, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Krueger","id":"37684049000"},{"name":"David Donofrio","affiliation":["Computational Research Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Donofrio","id":"37671269300"},{"name":"John Shalf","affiliation":["Computational Research Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Shalf","id":"37281789600"},{"name":"Marghoob Mohiyuddin","affiliation":["Computational Research Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA","Computer Science Division, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Marghoob","lastName":"Mohiyuddin","id":"37282520400"},{"name":"Samuel Williams","affiliation":["Computational Research Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Williams","id":"37401658600"},{"name":"Leonid Oliker","affiliation":["Computational Research Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Leonid","lastName":"Oliker","id":"37281795400"},{"name":"Franz-Josef Pfreundt","affiliation":["Fraunhofer ITWM, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Franz-Josef","lastName":"Pfreundt","id":"37303830700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0771-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0771-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-4329"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-4337"}],"articleNumber":"6114412","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":206},"abstract":"Reverse Time Migration (RTM) has become the standard for high-quality imaging in the seismic industry.

Results show that across highly-tuned high-order RTM stencils, the Green Wave implementation can offer up to 8\u00d7 and 3.5\u00d7 energy efficiency improvement per node respectively, compared with the Nehalem and GPU platforms.

Measured hardware performance results are also presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114415/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12493776","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114415/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The IBM Blue Gene/Q interconnection network and message unit","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The IBM Blue Gene/Q interconnection network and message unit","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"pap188s4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067221S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105609","isNumber":"6114389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105609","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6114389","articleId":"6114415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6114417,"authors":[{"name":"Kien Le","affiliation":["Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Kien","lastName":"Le","id":"37722778900"},{"name":"Ricardo Bianchini","affiliation":["Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Bianchini","id":"37265323800"},{"name":"Jingru Zhang","affiliation":["Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Jingru","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38241875000"},{"name":"Yogesh Jaluria","affiliation":["Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Yogesh","lastName":"Jaluria","id":"37293806400"},{"name":"Jiandong Meng","affiliation":["Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Jiandong","lastName":"Meng","id":"38242602200"},{"name":"Thu D.

GPUs offer a large number of parallel cores and have access to high memory bandwidth; however, data structure layouts in GPU memory often lead to sub optimal performance for programs designed with a CPU memory interface-or no particular memory interface at all!-in mind. This implies that application performance is highly sensitive irregularity in memory access patterns. This issue is all the more important due to the growing disparity between core and DRAM clocks; memory interfaces have increasingly become bottlenecks in computer systems. In this paper, we propose a simple API, Dymaxion , that allows programmers to optimize memory mappings to improve the efficiency of memory accesses on heterogeneous platforms. Use of Dymaxion requires only minimal modifications to existing CUDA programs. Our current framework extends NVIDIA's CUDA API with the addition of memory layout remapping and index transformation. We consider the overhead of layout remapping and effectively hide it through chunking and overlapping with PCI-E transfer. We present the implementation of Dymaxion and its optimizations and evaluate a variety of important memory access patterns. Using four case studies, we are able to achieve 3.3x speedup on GPU kernels and 20% overall performance improvement, including the PCI-E transfer, over the original CUDA implementations on an NVIDIA GTX 480 GPU. We also explore the importance of maintaining per-device data layouts and cross-device data map pings with a case study of concurrent CPU-GPU execution.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Layout","Indexes","Instruction sets","Arrays","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","concurrency control","coprocessors","data structures","DRAM chips","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Dymaxion","memory access pattern optimisation","heterogeneous system","graphics processor","general purpose computing","parallel cores","data structure layouts","GPU memory","CPU memory interface","memory access patterns","DRAM clocks","API","CUDA program","memory layout remapping","index transformation","PCI-E transfer","NVIDIA GTX 480 GPU","per-device data layouts","cross-device data map pings","concurrent CPU-GPU execution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous Computer Architectures","GPGPU","Memory Access and Data Layout","Latency Hiding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114426","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '11: Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105609/6114389/06114426.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114389","publicationTitle":"SC '11: Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dymaxion: Optimizing memory access patterns for heterogeneous systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dymaxion: Optimizing memory access patterns for heterogeneous systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114426/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114426/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12493787","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dymaxion: Optimizing memory access patterns for heterogeneous systems","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"pap290s4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08593S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105609","isNumber":"6114389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105609","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6114389","articleId":"6114426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6114435,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Mao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Mao","id":"37996934000"},{"name":"Marty Humphrey","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Marty","lastName":"Humphrey","id":"37276435000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0771-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4503-0771-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2167-4329"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2167-4337"}],"articleNumber":"6114435","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":2512},"abstract":"A goal in cloud computing is to allocate (and thus pay for) only those cloud resources that are truly needed. To date, cloud practitioners have pursued schedule-based (e.g., time-of-day) and rule-based mechanisms to attempt to automate this matching between computing requirements and computing resources. However, most of these \"auto-scaling\" mechanisms only support simple resource utilization indicators and do not specifically consider both user performance requirements and budget concerns. In this paper, we present an approach whereby the basic computing elements are virtual machines (VMs) of various sizes/costs, jobs are specified as workflows, users specify performance requirements by assigning (soft) deadlines to jobs, and the goal is to ensure all jobs are finished within their deadlines at minimum financial cost. We accomplish our goal by dynamically allocating/deallocating VMs and scheduling tasks on the most cost-efficient instances. We evaluate our approach in four representative cloud workload patterns and show cost savings from 9.8% to 40.4% compared to other approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '11: Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105609/6114389/06114435.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"SC '11: Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114389","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Auto-scaling to minimize cost and meet application deadlines in cloud workflows","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Dynamic scheduling","Data models","Servers","Silicon","Estimation","Schedules"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","formal specification","resource allocation","scheduling","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost minimization","application deadline","cloud workflow","cloud computing","cloud resource allocation","schedule-based mechanism","rule-based mechanism","computing requirement","computing resources","resource utilization","user performance requirement","virtual machines","performance requirement specification","soft deadline assignment","scheduling task","cloud workload pattern","cost saving"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud computing","auto-scaling","cost-minimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Auto-scaling to minimize cost and meet application deadlines in cloud workflows","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114435/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12493796","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auto-scaling to minimize cost and meet application deadlines in cloud workflows","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"pap381s4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094761S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105609","isNumber":"6114389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105609","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6114389","articleId":"6114435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6114440,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Li","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37598555300"},{"name":"Ke Chen","affiliation":["University of Notre Dame, USA","Hewlett Packard Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Chen","id":"38238884300"},{"name":"Ming-Yu Hsieh","affiliation":["Sandia National Laboratories, USA"],"firstName":"Ming-Yu","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37896706000"},{"name":"Naveen Muralimanohar","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"Naveen","lastName":"Muralimanohar","id":"37391840200"},{"name":"Chad D.

Memory errors contribute more than 40% of the total hardware-related failures and are projected to increase in future exascale systems. The use of error correction codes (ECC) and checkpointing are two effective approaches to fault tolerance. While there are numerous studies on ECC or checkpointing in isolation, this is the first paper to investigate the combined effect of both on overall system performance and power. Specifically, we study the impact of various ECC schemes (SECDED, BCH, and chipkill) in conjunction with checkpointing on future exascale systems. Our simulation results show that while chip kill is 13% better for computation-intensive applications, BCH has a 28% advantage in system energy-delay product (EDP) for memory-intensive applications. We also propose to use BCH in tagged memory systems with commodity DRAMs where chipkill is impractical.

However, it faces a number of issues to achieve the best performance from the underlying system. These include a serialization barrier that delays the reduce phase, repetitive merges and disk access, and lack of capability to leverage latest high speed interconnects. We describe Hadoop-A, an acceleration framework that optimizes Hadoop with plugin components implemented in C++ for fast data movement, overcoming its existing limitations. A novel network-levitated merge algorithm is introduced to merge data without repetition and disk access. In addition, a full pipeline is designed to overlap the shuffle, merge and reduce phases. Our experimental results show that Hadoop-A doubles the data processing throughput of Hadoop, and reduces CPU utilization by more than 36%.","publicationTitle":"SC '11: Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"SC '11: Proceedings of 2011 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105609/6114389/06114442.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hadoop acceleration through network levitated merge","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114442/","displayDocTitle":"Hadoop acceleration through network levitated merge","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12493803","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114442/","conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hadoop acceleration through network levitated merge","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"pap431s4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065585S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105609","isNumber":"6114389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105609","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6114389","articleId":"6114442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6114443,"authors":[{"name":"Wittawat Tantisiriroj","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Wittawat","lastName":"Tantisiriroj","id":"38189071800"},{"name":"Seung Woo Son","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Seung Woo","lastName":"Son","id":"37087810724"},{"name":"Swapnil Patil","affiliation":["Carnegie Mellon University, USA"],"firstName":"Swapnil","lastName":"Patil","id":"38238110700"},{"name":"Samuel J.

In both categories, the underlying file system is a key component for scalable application performance. In this paper, we explore the similarities and differences between PVFS, a parallel file system used in UPC at large scale, and HDFS, the primary storage system used in cloud computing with Hadoop. We integrate PVFS into Hadoop and compare its performance to HDFS using a set of data-intensive computing benchmarks. We study how HDFS-specific optimizations can be matched using PVFS and how consistency, durability, and persistence tradeoffs made by these file systems affect application performance. We show how to embed multiple replicas into a PVFS file, including a mapping with a complete copy local to the writing client, to emulate HDFS's file layout policies. We also highlight implementation issues with HDFS's dependence on disk bandwidth and benefits from pipelined replication.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6114443/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12493804","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the duality of data-intensive file system design: Reconciling HDFS and PVFS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the duality of data-intensive file system design: Reconciling HDFS and PVFS","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"pap435s4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115145S","chronDate":"12-18 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105609","isNumber":"6114389","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105609","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6114389","articleId":"6114443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ACM","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6114449,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojian Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaojian","lastName":"Wu","id":"37678199100"},{"name":"A.

With each process generation, process variations and defect rates are increasing, at the same time, cells are becoming more susceptible to soft errors with technology shrink. SRAMs will thus require increasing numbers of spares and stronger error correcting codes (ECCs), incurring higher area overheads and access-time penalties. Our overall objective is to develop new systematic approaches for designing defect-tolerant 6T-SRAMs optimized in terms of yield-per-area under high defect rates and high soft error rates, for given soft-error resilience and access-time requirements. In this paper, we analyze the key tradeoffs associated with using different numbers of spares and ECCs with different strengths. In addition to considering the usual role of each -- i.e., spares to combat defects and ECC to combat soft errors -- we also consider the ability of ECC to combat those defects which cannot be masked using available spares. We develop a new model that captures the benefits -- yield and resilience to soft errors -- of spares and ECC in an integrated manner. We also characterize area and access time overheads of the spares and the ECC scheme. We then integrate above into a framework to design 6T-SRAMs that optimizes yield-per-area. We demonstrate that the proposed approach provides dramatic improvements in yield and yield-per-area without compromising resilience to soft errors.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2011.71","publicationTitle":"2011 Asian Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6114262/6114277/06114525.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2011.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Yield-per-Area Optimization for 6T-SRAMs Using an Integrated Approach to Exploit Spares and ECC to Efficiently Combat High Defect and Soft-Error Rates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114525/","displayDocTitle":"Yield-per-Area Optimization for 6T-SRAMs Using an Integrated Approach to Exploit Spares and ECC to Efficiently Combat High Defect and Soft-Error Rates","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114525/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12462426","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Yield-per-Area Optimization for 6T-SRAMs Using an Integrated Approach to Exploit Spares and ECC to Efficiently Combat High Defect and Soft-Error Rates","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"4583a126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.134991S","chronDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6114262","isNumber":"6114277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6114262","xplore-issue":"6114277","articleId":"6114525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6114534,"authors":[{"name":"Brandon Noia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Noia","id":"37400445900"},{"name":"Krishnendu Chakrabarty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnendu","lastName":"Chakrabarty","id":"37273459000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1984-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4583-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-7735"},{"format":"CD","value":"1081-7735"}],"articleNumber":"6114534","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":381},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114534","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Through-silicon vias","Probes","Needles","Testing","Capacitance","Capacitors","Three dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","integrated circuit testing","integrated circuit yield","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["defective TSV identification","pre-bond testing","3D IC","yield assurance","defective TSV localization","pre-bond probing","parallel TSV test sessions","faulty TSV","optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dft","Pre-bond","Probing"]}],"abstract":"Pre-bond testing of TSVs has been identified as a major challenge for yield assurance in 3D ICs.

Through-silicon-vias (TSVs) which act as vertical links between layers pose challenges for 3D integration design. TSV defects can happen in fabrication process and bonding stage, which can reduce the yield and increase the cost. Recent work proposed the employment of redundant TSVs to improve the yield of 3D-ICs. This paper presents a redundant TSVs grouping technique, which partitions regular and redundant TSVs into groups. For each group, a set of multiplexers are used to select good signal paths away from defective TSVs. We investigate the impact of grouping ratio (regular-to-redundant TSVs in one group) on trade-off between yield and hardware overhead. We also show probabilistic models for yield analysis under the influence of independent and clustering defect distributions. Simulation results show that for a given number of TSVs and TSV failure rate, careful selection of grouping ratios lead to achieving 100% yield at minimal hardware cost (number of multiplexers and redundant TSVs) in comparison to a design that does not exploit TSV grouping ratios.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2011.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114277","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2011.37","publicationTitle":"2011 Asian Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6114262/6114277/06114536.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-Effective TSV Grouping for Yield Improvement of 3D-ICs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cost-Effective TSV Grouping for Yield Improvement of 3D-ICs","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114536/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12462436","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114536/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-Effective TSV Grouping for Yield Improvement of 3D-ICs","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"4583a201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072346S","chronDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6114262","isNumber":"6114277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6114262","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6114277","articleId":"6114536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6114563,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Patricia Magalhaes","affiliation":["Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ana Patricia","lastName":"Magalhaes","id":"38228314800"},{"name":"Jose Maria N.

Through the integration of these two approaches we aim to enhance model-driven techniques by the reuse of models, code, transformation rules and so on. As a result, Modden aims to leverage the reuse of these artifacts in different software development process phases.

Criticality Evaluation Framework of Digital Systems for Error Tolerant Video Applications","abstract":"Error tolerance is evolving into a new computing paradigm with further technology scaling, cost constraint, system scalability and emerging applications. Distinguished from defect tolerance and fault tolerance, error tolerance is based on application characteristics and relaxes the constraint of 100 percent functional correctness. From the viewpoint of error tolerance, this paper proposes a framework across multiple layers for fault criticality evaluation. Furthermore, taking an H.264/AVC decoder as an example, fault injection experiments demonstrate that for different functional modules, the faults in them bear different fault criticalities because of their unbalanced effects on applications, the faults in the same module also have diverse fault criticalities. The information that which faults are most critical can aid in test for yield and design for cost-effective fault tolerance. Error control techniques can be used to suppress error propagation and make more faults acceptable.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114751/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114751/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12462453","conferenceDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Fault Criticality Evaluation Framework of Digital Systems for Error Tolerant Video Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fault Criticality Evaluation Framework of Digital Systems for Error Tolerant Video Applications","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"4583a329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070546S","chronDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6114262","isNumber":"6114277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6114262","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6114277","articleId":"6114751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6114753,"authors":[{"name":"Jaewon Cha","affiliation":["dept. of electrical and electronic engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaewon","lastName":"Cha","id":"37085445802"},{"name":"Ilwoong Kim","affiliation":["dept. of electrical and electronic engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Ilwoong","lastName":"Kim","id":"38239250600"},{"name":"Sungho Kang","affiliation":["dept. of electrical and electronic engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sungho","lastName":"Kang","id":"37276366900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1984-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4583-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-7735"},{"format":"CD","value":"1081-7735"}],"articleNumber":"6114753","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memory","Arrays","Maintenance engineering","Algorithm design and analysis","Programming","Testing","Tunneling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","flash memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault detection algorithm","multilevel cell flash memory","MLC","SLC","density per unit area"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["flash memory","disturb fault model","Multi-level Cell","NAND flash memory","NOR flash memory","defect based fault model","Erase-PV3 checkerboard pattern","verify-level-shift program"]}],"abstract":"With a development of high-capacity flash memory, a variety of applications have been featured in the current market.

Existing research on such novel circuits focuses mainly on the integration between CMOS and non-CMOS, fabrication techniques and reliability improvement. However, research on defect analysis for yield and quality improvement is still in its infancy stage. This paper presents a framework of defect oriented testing in hybrid memory based on electrical simulation. First, a classification and definition of defects is introduced. Second, a simulation model for defect injection and circuit simulation is proposed. Third, a case study to illustrate how the proposed approach can be used to analyze the defects and translate their electrical faulty behavior into fault models - in order to develop the appropriate tests and design for testability schemes - is provided. The simulation results show that in addition to the occurrence of conventional semiconductor memories faults, new unique faults take place, e.g., faults that cause the cell to hold an undefined state. These new unique faults require new test approaches (e.g., DfT) in order to be able to detect them.","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2011.66","publicationTitle":"2011 Asian Test Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6114262/6114277/06114755.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2011.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Defect Oriented Testing for Hybrid CMOS/Memristor Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Defect Oriented Testing for Hybrid CMOS/Memristor Memory","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12472130","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114755/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114755/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","conferenceDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Defect Oriented Testing for Hybrid CMOS/Memristor Memory","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"4583a353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045611S","chronDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6114262","isNumber":"6114277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6114262","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6114277","articleId":"6114755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6114757,"authors":[{"name":"Alexios Spyronasios","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Eng, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece","TIMA Laboratory, CNRS-Grenoble INP, UJF, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Alexios","lastName":"Spyronasios","id":"37393717400"},{"name":"Louay Abdallah","affiliation":["TIMA Laboratory, CNRS-Grenoble INP, UJF, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Louay","lastName":"Abdallah","id":"37542484400"},{"name":"Haralampos-G.

In the case of SRAM cells, the static immunity to such perturbations is well characterized by means of the Static Noise Margin (SNM)defined as the maximum applicable series voltage at the inputs which causes no change in the data retention nodes. In addition, a significant number of disturbance sources present a transient behavior which has to be taken in consideration. In this paper, a metric to evaluate the cell robustness in the presence of transient voltage signals is proposed. Sufficiently high energy noise signals will compel the cell to flip to a failure state. On the other hand, sufficiently low energy noise signals will not be able to flip the cell and the state will be preserved. The Dynamic Noise Margin(DNM) metric is defined as the minimum energy of the voltage pulses able to flip the cell. A case example of transient voltage noise pulses on a 6T SRAM cell using 45nm technology has been studied. Simulation results show the use of the proposed metric as an indicator of cell robustness in the presence of transient voltage noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114765/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114765/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12472136","conferenceDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Transient Noise Failures in SRAM Cells: Dynamic Noise Margin Metric","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient Noise Failures in SRAM Cells: Dynamic Noise Margin Metric","confLoc":"New Delhi, India","sourcePdf":"4583a413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119036S","chronDate":"20-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6114262","isNumber":"6114277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6114262","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6114277","articleId":"6114765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6114769,"authors":[{"name":"Keheng Huang","firstName":"Keheng","lastName":"Huang","id":"38063881500"},{"name":"Yu Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37277445400"},{"name":"Xiaowei Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Li","id":"37280862300"},{"name":"Gengxin Hua","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Control Engineering, China"],"firstName":"Gengxin","lastName":"Hua","id":"38237286900"},{"name":"Hongjin Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Control Engineering, China"],"firstName":"Hongjin","lastName":"Liu","id":"38239766300"},{"name":"Bo Liu","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Control Engineering, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Liu","id":"38239420700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1984-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4583-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-7735"},{"format":"CD","value":"1081-7735"}],"articleNumber":"6114769","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Free LUT Entries to Mitigate Soft Errors in SRAM-based FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114769","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Circuit faults","Forward error correction","Field programmable gate arrays","Vectors","Reliability engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free LUT entries","soft errors","SRAM","FPGA","logic masking effect","not fully occupied look up table","logic synthesis","functional equivalent class"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["functional equivalent class","free LUT entries","not fully-occupied LUTs","soft error mitigation","logic synthesis","FPGAs"]}],"abstract":"As the feature size of FPGA shrinks to nanometers, SRAM-based FPGAs are more vulnerable to soft errors.

A new LUT programming function is introduced, the proposed method retains the original interconnect configuration and modifies the function of the LUTs using the so-called 1-Bit Sum Function (1-BSF), the 1-BSF detects all possible stuck-at and bridging faults (of all cardinalities) by utilizing the all zeros' vector and a walking-1 test set.

Processing at high-definition (HD) image allows a better access of visual information but also enhances the necessity of multi-resolution analysis because license plates may appear in various sizes and shapes. A great computational burden is accompanied by processing the great number of candidate windows during multi-resolution analysis. This paper proposes a hardwired license plate detector capable of conducting feature analysis on millions of candidate windows with the size of 100-by-100 pixel in average for one HD image. It employed a multiple-layer classification analyzing color, gradient and texture features at the rate of thirty frames per second. Candidate window fusion subsequent to classification compensates the over-detection occurred during multi-resolution analysis. A dual-loop processing is adopted to schedule the efforts in feature extraction to achieve a real-time system. Compared to the pure software implementation, a third-order speed up was found for the same algorithm with hardwired acceleration in FPGA emulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-Accelerated Vehicle License Plate Detection at High-Definition Image","publicationTitle":"2011 First International Conference on Robot, Vision and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/RVSP.2011.11","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 First International Conference on Robot, Vision and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6114264/6114587/06114916.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RVSP.2011.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-Accelerated Vehicle License Plate Detection at High-Definition Image","conferenceDate":"21-23 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114916/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12488931","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-Accelerated Vehicle License Plate Detection at High-Definition Image","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4581a106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05559S","chronDate":"21-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6114264","isNumber":"6114587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6114264","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6114587","articleId":"6114916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6114919,"authors":[{"name":"Hsien-I Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Automation Technology, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsien-I","lastName":"Lin","id":"37598148100"},{"name":"Yu-Cheng Liu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Automation Technology, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Cheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"38024945700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1881-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4581-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-9793"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-9807"}],"articleNumber":"6114919","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":482},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114919","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joints","Trajectory","Optimization","Planning","Service robots","Manipulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulators","particle swarm optimisation","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum-jerk robot joint trajectory","robot trajectory planning","robot control algorithm","joint inter-knot parameters","particle swarm optimization","Kmeans clustering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Trajectory planning","minimum-jerk joint trajectory","particle swarm optimization","K-means"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RVSP.2011.70","pdfPath":"/iel5/6114264/6114587/06114919.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 First International Conference on Robot, Vision and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 First International Conference on Robot, Vision and Signal Processing","startPage":"118","endPage":"121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RVSP.2011.70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimum-Jerk Robot Joint Trajectory Using Particle Swarm Optimization","abstract":"In robot trajectory planning, finding the minimum-jerk joint trajectory is a crucial issue in robotics because most robots are asked to perform a smooth trajectory. Jerk, the third derivative of joint position of a trajectory, influences how smoothly and efficiently a robot moves. Thus, the minimum-jerk joint trajectory makes the robot control algorithm simple and robust. To find the minimum-jerk joint trajectory, it has been formulated as an optimization problem constrained by joint inter-knot parameters including initial joint displacement and velocity, intermediate joint displacement, and final joint displacement and velocity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) with Kmeans clustering for solving the near-global minimum-jerk joint trajectory subject to different objective functions, which differs from previous work in its simple implementation and generalization. Computer simulations were conducted and showed the competent performance of our approach on a six degree-of-freedom robot manipulator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114919/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12488934","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114919/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"21-23 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Minimum-Jerk Robot Joint Trajectory Using Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimum-Jerk Robot Joint Trajectory Using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4581a118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050286S","chronDate":"21-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6114264","isNumber":"6114587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6114264","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6114587","articleId":"6114919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6114946,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Hsin Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Formosa University, Yunlin County, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hsin","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37277349000"},{"name":"Yung-Fa Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Fa","lastName":"Huang","id":"37335701600"},{"name":"Yung-Pei Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Formosa University, Yunlin, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Pei","lastName":"Cheng","id":"38239658200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1881-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4581-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-9793"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-9807"}],"articleNumber":"6114946","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","OFDM","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Channel estimation","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subchannel inversion","multicarrier OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","multiplex subcarrier power restrictive environment","power allocation method","bit error rate","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)","subcarrie","feedback","channel state information (CSI)","power allocation"]}],"abstract":"The problem of power loading that have been research in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) Systems.

From the simulation, our proposed sub carriers power allocation scheme can achieve better performance in bit error rate (BER).","doi":"10.1109/RVSP.2011.42","publicationTitle":"2011 First International Conference on Robot, Vision and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 First International Conference on Robot, Vision and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6114264/6114587/06114946.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RVSP.2011.42","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Subchannel Inversion for Power Allocation in Multicarrier OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6114946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6114946/","displayDocTitle":"The Subchannel Inversion for Power Allocation in Multicarrier OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12488961","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6114946/","conferenceDate":"21-23 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Subchannel Inversion for Power Allocation in Multicarrier OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4581a237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046726S","chronDate":"21-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6114264","isNumber":"6114587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6114264","xplore-issue":"6114587","articleId":"6114946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6114952,"authors":[{"name":"Kien Quang Nguyen","affiliation":["Intelligent Computer Entertainment Laboratory, Ritsumeikan University"],"firstName":"Kien Quang","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38529196300"},{"name":"Ruck Thawonmas","affiliation":["Intelligent Computer Entertainment Laboratory, Ritsumeikan University"],"firstName":"Ruck","lastName":"Thawonmas","id":"38193215600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0259-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0258-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0257-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-6741"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-675X"}],"articleNumber":"6114952","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Vectors","Monte Carlo methods","Roads","Ice","Aerospace electronics","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer games","Monte Carlo methods","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo tree search","collaborative ghost team control","ghost tree","ghost perspective","ICE gUCT","CEC 2011 Ms Pac-Man","ghost team competition"]}],"abstract":"We present an application of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to controlling ghosts in the game of Ms Pac-Man.

The system consists of a ground facing monocular camera mounted on an IMU that is observing ground plane feature points. The motion estimation procedure is through tracking detected corresponding feature points between two successive image frames. The main contribution of this paper is a novel closed-form measurement model based on the image data and IMU output signals. In contrast to existing methods, our algorithm is independent of the underlying vision algorithm such as image motion estimation or optical flow algorithms for camera motion estimation. Additionally, unlike the visual-SLAM based methods, our approach is not based on data association. The algorithm has been implemented using an Extended Kalman filter (EKF), which propagates the current and the last state of the system updated in the previous measurement state. Simulation results show that the introduced method is persistent to the level of the noise and works well even with few numbers of features.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 First International Conference on Robot, Vision and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6114264/6114587/06115004.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"291","publicationTitle":"2011 First International Conference on Robot, Vision and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/RVSP.2011.64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RVSP.2011.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114587","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6115004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision-Aided Inertial Navigation Using Planar Terrain Features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Mathematical model","Navigation","Current measurement","Vectors","Feature extraction","Motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","feature extraction","inertial navigation","inertial systems","Kalman filters","motion estimation","nonlinear filters","robot vision","sensor fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision-aided inertial navigation system","planar terrain features","inertial measurement unit","camera ego-motion estimation","ground facing monocular camera","tracking feature point detection","image frames","closed-form measurement model","image motion estimation","optical flow algorithms","visual-SLAM based methods","data association","extended Kalman filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["vision-aided INS","ego-motion","augmented EKF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Vision-Aided Inertial Navigation Using Planar Terrain Features","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6115004/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12488974","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"21-23 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision-Aided Inertial Navigation Using Planar Terrain Features","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"4581a287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053477S","chronDate":"21-23 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6114264","isNumber":"6114587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6114264","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6114587","articleId":"6115004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6115054,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Xinli","affiliation":["School of Economy and Management, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Xinli","id":"37275707500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-450-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-1456"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-1472"}],"articleNumber":"6115054","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":62},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6115054","abstract":"This paper uses the global optimization of genetic algorithm to construct a genetic neural network model (GANN) forecasting listed company financial crisis.

The prediction method employs Wright's extension to Holt's method of Exponential Double Sampling (EDS) coupled with a change detection mechanism based on exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA). The main advantages of EDSAS are that it does not require heavy computation, incurs low memory and communication overhead and the prediction model can be implemented with ease on resource constrained sensor nodes. EDSAS has been evaluated by using real urban road traffic Carbon Monoxide (CO) pollution datasets and has been compared and shown to give better results for performance metrics like sampling fraction and miss ratio.

Although some smart meters make use of wireless data transfers between their sensor and display units, their integration into existing wireless sensor networks is hampered by proprietary communication interfaces and their lack of re programmability. Furthermore, the sole availability of aggregate consumption values renders current meters insufficient for novel application scenarios like smart home automation, for which information at device-level granularity and high resolution is vital. We address these shortcomings of existing solutions by presenting SmartMeter.KOM, our wireless sensor node capable of determining the current consumption of individual electrical appliances at high resolution. The platform is based on low-power hardware and incorporates a reprogrammable microcontroller which allows developers to easily deploy new algorithms. Its IEEE 802.15.4-compliant radio transceiver makes its integration with existing sensor networks possible, and thus enables their integration in smart buildings. We demonstrate the versatility of SmartMeter.KOM by presenting prototypical implementations of smart applications and identifying further research directions.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2011.6115159","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 36th Conference on Local Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 36th Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105664/6114410/06115159.pdf","startPage":"1032","endPage":"1039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2011.6115159","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"SmartMeter.KOM: A low-cost wireless sensor for distributed power metering","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6115159/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12506104","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115159/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SmartMeter.KOM: A low-cost wireless sensor for distributed power metering","confLoc":"Bonn, Germany","sourcePdf":"p1032reinhardt.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057152S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105664","isNumber":"6114410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105664","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6114410","articleId":"6115159","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-21"},{"_id":6115184,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Fogue","affiliation":["University of Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Fogue","id":"37547955400"},{"name":"Piedad Garrido","affiliation":["University of Zaragoza, Spain"],"firstName":"Piedad","lastName":"Garrido","id":"37718413200"},{"name":"Francisco J.

Regarding traffic safety applications for VANETs, warning messages have to be quickly disseminated in order to reduce the required dissemination time and to increase the number of vehicles receiving the traffic warning information. In the past, several approaches have been proposed to improve the alert dissemination process in multi-hop wireless networks, but none of them is adapted to the propagation features of the scenario. In this paper, we present an adaptive algorithm designed to improve the warning message dissemination process. With respect to previous proposals, our proposed scheme uses a mapping technique based on adapting the dissemination strategy according to the characteristics of the street area where the vehicles are moving. Our algorithm reported a noticeable improvement in the performance of alert dissemination processes in simulated scenarios based on real city maps.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using roadmap profiling to enhance the warning message dissemination in vehicular environments","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 36th Conference on Local Computer Networks","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2011.6115184","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 36th Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105664/6114410/06115184.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2011.6115184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114410","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6115184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115184/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Using roadmap profiling to enhance the warning message dissemination in vehicular environments","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6115184/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12506129","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using roadmap profiling to enhance the warning message dissemination in vehicular environments","confLoc":"Bonn, Germany","sourcePdf":"p18fogue.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073773S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105664","isNumber":"6114410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105664","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6114410","articleId":"6115184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6115516,"authors":[{"name":"Andre C.

The sensing order indicates the sequence of channels sensed by the secondary users when searching for an available channel. When using an optimal sensing order, the secondary user can find faster a free channel with high quality. Brute-force algorithms may be used to And the optimal sensing order. However, this approach requires great computational effort. Even in scenarios where the secondary user knows the probability of each channel being available, the sensing order where the most available channels are sensed first is not ideal when using adaptive modulation. Therefore, we propose an approach using reinforcement learning to search dynamically for the optimal sensing order. Through simulations, we evaluated our proposal and compared its performance with other mechanisms, and the results obtained are close to the optimal value provided by the brute-force and superior to the other mechanisms in most of the scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115516/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12506192","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6115516/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Channel sensing order for cognitive radio networks using reinforcement learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel sensing order for cognitive radio networks using reinforcement learning","confLoc":"Bonn, Germany","sourcePdf":"p546mendes.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058278S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105664","isNumber":"6114410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105664","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6114410","articleId":"6115516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6115527,"authors":[{"name":"Georgi Iliev","affiliation":["Department of Communication Networks, Technical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Georgi","lastName":"Iliev","id":"37282360200"},{"name":"Vladimir Poulkov","affiliation":["Department of Communication Networks, Technical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Poulkov","id":"37680505600"},{"name":"Miglen Ovtcharov","affiliation":["Department of Communication Networks, Technical University of Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria"],"firstName":"Miglen","lastName":"Ovtcharov","id":"37680507500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-928-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-926-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-927-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"},{"format":"CD","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6115527","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","Computational complexity","Bit error rate","Receivers","Computational modeling","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","interference suppression","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NBI suppression method","MIMO OSTBC-OFDM systems","narrowband interference suppression methods","multiple input multiple output communication","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","digital wireless communication system","orthogonal space-time block coding","pricing coefficient"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational Complexity","MIMO","Narrowband Interference","OFDM","Wireless Systems"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a comparison of several narrowband interference (NBI) suppression methods for Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) digital wireless communication systems with Orthogonal Space-Time Block Coding (OSTBC) is done.

Discontinuous Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DOFDM) is a good way for a secondary user to access several spectrum fragments simultaneously with one Radio Front (RF). In this paper, a novel Channel Characteristic Aware Spectrum Aggregation (CCASA) algorithm which uses DOFDM to aggregation spectrum fragments with only one radio front is proposed in order to increase the overall throughput of a CR network. By combining Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) and spectrum aggregation, the good subcarriers are assigned to the specific secondary users in CCASA algorithm thus achieving a better channel efficiency. Different bandwidth requirement and aggregation limitation of secondary users are both considered in this algorithm while maintaining a fairly low computational complexity. The simulation results show that CCASA achieves a bigger total throughput than existing aggregation algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115528/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12506204","htmlLink":"/document/6115528/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Channel Characteristic Aware Spectrum Aggregation algorithm in Cognitive Radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Characteristic Aware Spectrum Aggregation algorithm in Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Bonn, Germany","sourcePdf":"p634lin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088711S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105664","isNumber":"6114410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105664","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6114410","articleId":"6115528","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6115543,"authors":[{"name":"Kok-Lim Alvin Yau","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Kok-Lim Alvin","lastName":"Yau","id":"37683359300"},{"name":"Peter Komisarczuk","affiliation":["School of Computing and Technology, University of West London, UK"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Komisarczuk","id":"37411435400"},{"name":"Paul D.

Context awareness and intelligence enable the SU to sense for and use the underutilized licensed spectrum in an efficient manner. This paper investigates various learning mechanisms for achieving context awareness and intelligence with respect to Dynamic Channel Selection (DCS) in CR networks. The learning mechanisms are Adaptation (Adapt), Window (Win), Adaptation-Window (AdaptWin), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The DCS scheme helps SU base station to select channel adaptively for data transmission to its SU host in static and mobile centralized CR networks. The purpose is to enhance quality of service, particularly throughput and delay (in terms of number of channel switches), in the presence of channel heterogeneity. Our contribution is to investigate simple and yet pragmatic learning mechanisms for CR networks. Simulation results reveal that RL, AdaptWin and Win achieve approximately similar and the best possible network performance, followed by Adapt, and finally Random, which does not apply learning and serves as baseline.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12506219","htmlLink":"/document/6115543/","conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Learning mechanisms for achieving context awareness and intelligence in Cognitive Radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning mechanisms for achieving context awareness and intelligence in Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Bonn, Germany","sourcePdf":"p738yau.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107244S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105664","isNumber":"6114410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105664","xplore-issue":"6114410","articleId":"6115543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6115562,"authors":[{"name":"Shahrouz Sharifi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Advanced Communication Research Institute, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Shahrouz","lastName":"Sharifi","id":"38235577500"},{"name":"Babak Hossein Khalaj","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Advanced Communication Research Institute, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Babak Hossein","lastName":"Khalaj","id":"37279658000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-928-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-926-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-927-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"},{"format":"CD","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6115562","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Synchronization","Delay","Discrete Fourier transforms","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mathematical analysis","OFDM modulation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM systems","time offsets","carrier frequency offsets","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","frequency selective channel","mathematical models","closed-form expression","channel delay","channel taps","power delay profile"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","carrier frequency offset","time offset","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)","synchronization-errors"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the impact of both time offsets (TOs) and carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) on the average output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in a frequency selective channel is investigated with a novel approach. First, TOs are partitioned into Ave cases based on how they occur. Then the mathematical models for different cases are derived. Considering CFOs and benefiting from the obtained models, closed-form expression for the SINR in each case is derived. It is proved that, SINR is independent of the observed subcarrier for the given TO and CFO. Besides, it is shown that the performance of the affected system deteriorates rapidly as the number of subcarriers increases. It is also revealed that, as far as the guard interval is longer than the channel delay spread, the SINR is not much sensitive to the number of channel taps and power delay profile.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2011.6115562","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 36th Conference on Local Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 36th Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105664/6114410/06115562.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2011.6115562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6114410","startPage":"855","endPage":"859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SINR analysis of time and frequency offsets in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6115562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SINR analysis of time and frequency offsets in OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115562/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12506238","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6115562/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SINR analysis of time and frequency offsets in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Bonn, Germany","sourcePdf":"p855sharifi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069621S","chronDate":"4-7 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105664","isNumber":"6114410","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105664","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6114410","articleId":"6115562","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6115603,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Tang","affiliation":["Center of Excellence for Document Analysis and Recognition, State University of New York, University at Buffalo, Amherst, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Tang","id":"38194924000"},{"name":"Sargur N.

Existing ellipse detection algorithms, viz., randomized Hough transform (RHT) and multi-population genetic algorithm (MPGA), have disadvantages. The RHT performs poorly with multiple ellipses and MPGA has a high false positive rate for complex images. The proposed algorithm selects random points using constraints of smoothness, distance and curvature. In the process of sampling, parameters of potential ellipses are progressively learnt to improve parameter accuracy. New probabilistic fitness measures are used to verify ellipses extracted: ellipse quality based on the Ramanujan approximation and completeness. Experiments on synthetic and real images show performance better than RHT and MPGA in detecting multiple, deformed, full or partial ellipses in the presence of noise and interference.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115603","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06115603.pdf","startPage":"1045","endPage":"1048","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ellipse detection using sampling constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Ellipse detection using sampling constraints","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6115603/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12504413","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115603/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ellipse detection using sampling constraints","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p1045tang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061586S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6115603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6115608,"authors":[{"name":"Mayssaa Al Najjar","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, USA"],"firstName":"Mayssaa Al","lastName":"Najjar","id":"38242014700"},{"name":"Swetha Karlapudi","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, USA"],"firstName":"Swetha","lastName":"Karlapudi","id":"37589482700"},{"name":"Magdy Bayoumi","affiliation":["The Center for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Louisiana, Lafayette, Lafayette, USA"],"firstName":"Magdy","lastName":"Bayoumi","id":"37273386500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6115608","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Hysteresis","Hardware","Computer architecture","Real time systems","Application specific integrated circuits","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","feature extraction","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-performance ASIC architecture","hysteresis thresholding","component feature extraction","limited-resource applications","object detection","constrained streaming processors","candidate pixel handling","VGA images","component analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["analysis","feature extraction","hysteresis thresholding","object detection","streaming hardware"]}],"abstract":"Hysteresis thresholding offers enhanced object detection but is time-consuming.

This features two memory-efficient and fast architectures for hysteresis thresholding followed by object feature extraction: a lower-area uniform implementation and a faster pipelined one with slight area increase. Both designs couple thresholding with candidate pixel handling, component analysis, and feature extraction on the fly. This avoids multiple scans of the image, additional label resolving, and large image buffers; thus offering an average speedup up to 37\u00d7 with about 99% memory reduction compared to state of the art schemes for VGA images. Moreover, the ASIC implementation allows this process to be done at 460fps, making the integration of this part into real-time detection systems very feasible.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115608","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06115608.pdf","startPage":"1061","endPage":"1064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115608","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-performance asic architecture for hysteresis thresholding and component feature extraction in limited-resource applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6115608","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115608/","displayDocTitle":"High-performance asic architecture for hysteresis thresholding and component feature extraction in limited-resource applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12504418","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6115608/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-performance asic architecture for hysteresis thresholding and component feature extraction in limited-resource applications","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p1061alnajjar.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057003S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6115608","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6115643,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Behnad","affiliation":["The Edward S.

In contrast, the proposed HMM-based deinterlacing technique adopts an approach of sequence estimation and makes a joint decision on the row of missing pixels as a whole. This allows a more thorough exploitation of the spatial correlation of the image signal. The HMM-based sequence estimation technique is coupled with a number of existing spatial deinterlacing algorithms in the literature to boost their performance. Experimental results show that HMM can significantly improve the deinterlacing results in both PSNR measure and subjective visual quality.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115643","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06115643.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","startPage":"1189","endPage":"1192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hidden Markov model-based methodology for intra-field video deinterlacing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6115643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A hidden Markov model-based methodology for intra-field video deinterlacing","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115643/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12504453","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6115643/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hidden Markov model-based methodology for intra-field video deinterlacing","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p1189behnad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059982S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6115643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6115650,"authors":[{"name":"Jaewon Sung","affiliation":["Convergence Lab, LG Electronics Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaewon","lastName":"Sung","id":"37574142300"},{"name":"Seung-Wook Park","affiliation":["Convergence Lab, LG Electronics Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seung-Wook","lastName":"Park","id":"37406944900"},{"name":"Joonyoung Park","affiliation":["Convergence Lab, LG Electronics Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joonyoung","lastName":"Park","id":"37407058600"},{"name":"Byeong-Moon Jeon","affiliation":["Convergence Lab, LG Electronics Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byeong-Moon","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37399565300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6115650","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Video coding","Vectors","Transform coding","Motion compensation","Bit rate","Motion segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image representation","motion compensation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["picture-level parameteric motion representation","motion compensation","block-based translational motion model","multiple homography transformations","warped reference pictures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Warped reference picture","inter-prediction","motion compensation","parametric motion model"]}],"abstract":"When a picture contains non-translational motions in it, a picture-level parametric motion model can be more efficient than the block-based translational motion model because the former has small number of parameters that can replace many motion vectors of individual blocks.

Our approach relies on the sparse representation of a test sample with respect to all training samples in a feature space induced by a kernel function. Projecting the samples into the feature space and kernelizing the sparse representation improves the separability of the data and thus yields higher classification accuracy compared to the more conventional linear sparsity-based classification algorithm. Moreover, the spatial coherence across neighboring pixels is also incorporated through a kernelized joint sparsity model, where all of the pixels within a small neighborhood are sparsely represented in the feature space by selecting a few common training samples. Two greedy algorithms are also provided in this paper to solve the kernel versions of the pixel-wise and jointly sparse recovery problems. Experimental results show that the proposed technique outperforms the linear sparsity-based classification technique and the classical Support Vector Machine classifiers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06115655.pdf","startPage":"1233","endPage":"1236","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6115655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral image classification via kernel sparse representation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Matching pursuit algorithms","Training","Indexes","Hyperspectral imaging","Vectors","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image classification","image representation","image resolution","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral image classification","kernel sparse representation","kernel function","spatial coherence","neighboring pixels","kernelized joint sparsity model","support vector machine classifiers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral image classification via kernel sparse representation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6115655/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12504465","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral image classification via kernel sparse representation","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p1233chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096856S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6115655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6115668,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Our methodology is based on 2D and 3D wavelet transforms, which are used to estimate multi-scale features from real a face acquired by a 3D scanner. The proposed methodology starts by considering a dataset composed by faces displaying seven different facial expressions. An automatic pre-processing method, adopting an ellipsoidal cropping, is applied to the dataset. Thereafter, the 2D and 3D descriptors are extracted from different scales of wavelet transforms for the purpose of obtaining the facial expression features. The multi-scale features are represented in a multi-variate feature space, which is analysed by the Sequential Forward Floating Selection algorithm using an entropy criterion function to select the subset of features that best represents each facial expression model. The obtained results corroborate the potential of multi-scale feature extraction for analysis of 3D facial expression.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115668","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06115668.pdf","startPage":"1281","endPage":"1284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D facial expression analysis by using 2D AND 3D wavelet transforms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6115668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115668/","displayDocTitle":"3D facial expression analysis by using 2D AND 3D wavelet transforms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12504478","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6115668/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D facial expression analysis by using 2D AND 3D wavelet transforms","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p1281pinto.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057736S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6115668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6115685,"authors":[{"name":"Kwok-Wai Hung","affiliation":["Centre for Signal Processing, Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kwok-Wai","lastName":"Hung","id":"37411800800"},{"name":"Wan-Chi Siu","affiliation":["Centre for Signal Processing, Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Wan-Chi","lastName":"Siu","id":"37270783500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6115685","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Trajectory","Image resolution","Image edge detection","Conferences","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image resolution","probability","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video interpolation","video upsampling","linear motion model","probabilistic motion field","super-resolution reconstruction","neighboring pixels weighted average","error approximation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interpolation","upsampling","image processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6115685","abstract":"Recently, the probabilistic motion field was proposed for super-resolution reconstruction (SRR).

By learning context-specific image sparse representation, our method aims to model the relationship between the interpolated image patches and their ground truth pixel values from different context categories via support vector regression (SVR). To synthesize the final SR output, we upsample the input image by bicubic interpolation, followed by the refinement of each image patch using the SVR model learned from the associated context category. Unlike prior learning-based SR methods, our approach does not require the reoccurrence of similar image patches (within or across image scales), and we do not need to collect training low and high-resolution image data in advance either. Empirical results show that our proposed method is quantitatively and qualitatively more effective than existing interpolation or learning-based SR approaches.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115687","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06115687.pdf","startPage":"1349","endPage":"1352","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115687","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning context-aware sparse representation for single image super-resolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Learning context-aware sparse representation for single image super-resolution","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6115687/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12504497","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115687/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning context-aware sparse representation for single image super-resolution","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p1349yang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055125S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6115687","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6115707,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Tashrif Kamal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed Tashrif","lastName":"Kamal","id":"38283956400"},{"name":"Bi Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Riverside, USA"],"firstName":"Bi","lastName":"Song","id":"38276872700"},{"name":"Amit K.

This space-filling curve is constructed by using a minimum spanning tree reflecting structural context of the input image. This novel image abstraction approach is completely different from conventional approaches. By using the proposed method, aggregation of texture details and enhancement of sharp edges are effectively realized while preserving structural contexts such as thin lines, sharp corners, and so on. The structural-context-preserving abstraction capability of the proposed method is verified by some experimental results and examples.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115719","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06115719.pdf","startPage":"1465","endPage":"1468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structural-context-preserving image abstraction by using space-filling curve based on minimum spanning tree","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6115719","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115719/","displayDocTitle":"Structural-context-preserving image abstraction by using space-filling curve based on minimum spanning tree","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12504529","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6115719/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structural-context-preserving image abstraction by using space-filling curve based on minimum spanning tree","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p1465koga.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042916S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6115719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6115764,"authors":[{"name":"Keita Takahashi","affiliation":["IRT Research Initiative, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Keita","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37277673100"},{"name":"Takeshi Naemura","affiliation":["IRT Research Initiative, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Naemura","id":"37268444000"},{"name":"Masayuki Tanaka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37291811600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6115764","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Strontium","Image coding","Numerical models","Image resolution","Decoding","Rate-distortion","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","frequency-domain analysis","image reconstruction","image resolution","radio receivers","rate distortion theory","video coding","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate distortion analysis","super resolution image decoding","video decoding","video communication","image reconstruction","receiver","numerical model","frequency-domain SR model","lossy image compression","real image simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image coding","super resolution","rate-distortion theory","image reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"An image/video communication scenario with super-resolution (SR) decoding, where the decoded images are upsampled using SR reconstruction at the receiver side, is analyzed from a theoretical perspective.

We considered several factors that affect the reconstruction quality, and revealed that SR decoding performs better in low bitrates. We also conducted real-image simulations and confirmed that both the numerical analysis and real-image simulations exhibit quite similar tendencies, which supports the effectiveness of our numerical model.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115764","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06115764.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6115764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","startPage":"1629","endPage":"1632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-distortion analysis of super-resolution image/video decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6115764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rate-distortion analysis of super-resolution image/video decoding","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115764/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12504574","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6115764/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-distortion analysis of super-resolution image/video decoding","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p1629takahashi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08143S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6115764","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6115771,"authors":[{"name":"Shiqi Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Media, Peking University, Beijing, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Shiqi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37066676400"},{"name":"Abdul Rehman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Abdul","lastName":"Rehman","id":"37718604600"},{"name":"Zhou Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291903900"},{"name":"Siwei Ma","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Media, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Siwei","lastName":"Ma","id":"37280187700"},{"name":"Wen Gao","affiliation":["Institute of Digital Media, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37275735100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6115771","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"abstract":"We propose a perceptual video coding framework based on an SSIM-inspired divisive normalization scheme as an attempt to transform the DCT domain frame prediction residuals to a perceptually uniform space before coding.

However, acquisition systems are limited in their pixels per second throughput given as power and complexity constraints. Simply capturing more pixels in a given system is often not possible. We propose a new non-regular imaging architecture that samples only few pixels and reconstructs a high resolution image afterwards. Our sampling is optimized to provide non-regular spatial sampling from a sensor with regular readout circuits. An existing slow image acquisition system can then be used to capture the data. The image reconstruction is performed with a local sparsity-based approach. The result is a high resolution image that requires a much smaller effort during acquisition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6115839/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12504649","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Increasing imaging resolution by covering your sensor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing imaging resolution by covering your sensor","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p1897schoberl.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073937S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6115839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":6115846,"authors":[{"name":"Laurent Jacques","affiliation":["ICTEAM/ELEN, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain, Belgium"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Jacques","id":"38579243500"},{"name":"David Kenric Hammond","affiliation":["Neuroinformatics Center, University of Oregon, USA"],"firstName":"David Kenric","lastName":"Hammond","id":"37295258400"},{"name":"Jalal Fadili","affiliation":["GREYC CNRS-ENSICAEN, Universit\u00e9 de Caen Basse-Normandie, Caen, France"],"firstName":"Jalal","lastName":"Fadili","id":"38182034400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6115846","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Sensors","Vectors","Compressed sensing","Decoding","Image reconstruction","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image reconstruction","image sampling","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniformly quantized compressed sensing","sparse signal recovery","compressible signal recovery","basis pursuit dequantizer","sign sensitive weighting","lp-norm fidelity constraint","SNR","signal reconstruction","decoder","side-position-to-level oracle","reconstruction error reduction","oversampling principle","1D signal","2D signal"]}],"abstract":"Following the Compressed Sensing (CS) paradigm, this paper studies the problem of recovering sparse or compressible signals from (scalar) non-uniformly quantized measurements.

As a good indication of this improvement origin, we prove theoretically that a similar decoder, using a particular side-position-to-level oracle, displays a reduction of the reconstruction error when both the number of measurements and the moment p of the constraint increase. This follows the oversampling principle underlined in our previous study for uniformly quantized CS, with an additional gain provided by the non-uniform quantization.

To improve the coding efficiency of intra frame coding, up to 34 intra prediction modes are defined in HEVC. The best mode among these pre-defined intra prediction modes is selected by rate-distortion optimization (RDO) for each block. If all directions are tested in the RDO process, it will be very time-consuming. To alleviate the encoder computation load, this paper proposes a new method to reduce the candidates in RDO process. In addition, the direction information of the neighboring blocks is made full use of to speed up intra mode decision. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides 20% and 28% time savings in intra high efficiency and low complexity cases on average compared to the default encoding scheme in HM 1.0 with almost the same coding efficiency. This algorithm has been proposed to HEVC standard and partially adopted into the HEVC test model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6115979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12493693","htmlLink":"/document/6115979/","conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Fast mode decision algorithm for intra prediction in HEVC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast mode decision algorithm for intra prediction in HEVC","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"001571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054138S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105444","isNumber":"6114275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105444","citationCount":"185","xplore-issue":"6114275","articleId":"6115979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6115991,"authors":[{"name":"Julia Schmidt","affiliation":["Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Universitaet Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Julia","lastName":"Schmidt","id":"38557932200"},{"name":"Bernd Edler","affiliation":["International Audio Laboratories, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Edler","id":"37298013400"},{"name":"Joern Ostermann","affiliation":["Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Universitaet Hannover, Hanover, Germany"],"firstName":"Joern","lastName":"Ostermann","id":"38556369600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1322-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1321-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1320-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6115991","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete cosine transforms","Motion compensation","Correlation","Covariance matrix","Bit rate","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","discrete cosine transforms","motion compensation","motion estimation","prediction theory","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DCT coefficient prediction","motion compensation error distribution","video coding","discrete cosine transform","spatial correlation reduction","motion estimation residual","prediction error variance"]}],"abstract":"Current video coding techniques use a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to reduce spatial correlations within the motion estimation residual.

Distributed video coding (DVC), an emerging coding technology based on Wyner-Ziv theory, seems to be a possible solution for implementing low-power video sensors since most of the computational complexity is moved from the encoder to the decoder. In this paper, existing works on DVC are discussed with rate-distortion and power consumption analyses compared with H.264/AVC-based approaches. We show that, since more transmission power is required for compensating the lower rate-distortion performance, the power consumption of sensor nodes using DVC is just similar to that of using H.264/AVC with zero motion vectors. Therefore, there is still a room for improvement to make DVC applicable for distributed wireless video sensors. Based on our analysis results, several possible research directions, such as studies on the trade- off between hardware cost and system power consumption, are also addressed in this paper under a unified DVC framework.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6116018/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12493732","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Distributed video coding: A promising solution for distributed wireless video sensors or not?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed video coding: A promising solution for distributed wireless video sensors or not?","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"002171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057829S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105444","isNumber":"6114275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105444","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6114275","articleId":"6116018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6116020,"authors":[{"name":"Hasan Demirel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Eastern Mediterranean University, Gazi Magusa, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hasan","lastName":"Demirel","id":"37338249900"},{"name":"Gholamreza Anbarjafari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Gazikent University, Gaziantep, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gholamreza","lastName":"Anbarjafari","id":"37596451000"},{"name":"Cagn Ozcinar","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, University of Surrey, Surrey, UK"],"firstName":"Cagn","lastName":"Ozcinar","id":"38229873700"},{"name":"Sara Izadpanahi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Eastern Mediterranean University, Gazi Magusa, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Izadpanahi","id":"38229870000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6116020","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":316},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Video sequences","Lighting","Interpolation","Discrete wavelet transforms","Signal resolution","Spatial resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","image sequences","interpolation","inverse problems","singular value decomposition","source separation","trees (mathematics)","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiframe video resolution enhancement technique","dual tree complex wavelet transform","video registration","illumination compensation","singular value decomposition","discrete wavelet transform","frame decomposition","bicubic interpolation","frame registration","Vandewalle registration","structure adaptive normalized convolution reconstruction","subband interpolation","inverse DT-CWT","Akiyo video sequence"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a multi-frame video resolution enhancement technique based on dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT). Here, before registration step, the respective frames have been passed through an illumination compensation procedure which is based on singular value decomposition (SVD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The frame subject to the resolution enhancement is decomposed into its different frequency subbands by using DT-CWT. The high frequency subbands have been interpolated by using bicubic interpolation. Furthermore, the compensated frames are registered by using Vandewalle registration with structure adaptive normalized convolution reconstruction. Afterwards, the interpolated subbands and the output of the registration technique have been combined by using inverse DT-CWT (IDT-CWT) in order to reconstruct the super resolved frame. For Akiyo video sequence there is 5.04 dB, 4.86 dB, 5.22 dB, and 5.05 dB improvements in the average PSNR values compared to Vandewalle, Marcel, Lucchese, and Keren registration techniques, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116020","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116020.pdf","startPage":"2093","endPage":"2096","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video resolution enhancement by using complex wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6116020","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116020/","displayDocTitle":"Video resolution enhancement by using complex wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12504704","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6116020/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video resolution enhancement by using complex wavelet transform","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p2093demirel.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067974S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6116045,"authors":[{"name":"Liangjun Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Liangjun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406764300"},{"name":"Xiaolin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37281235500"},{"name":"Guangming Shi","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, China"],"firstName":"Guangming","lastName":"Shi","id":"37267099300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1322-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1321-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1320-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6116045","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PSNR","Decoding","Pollution measurement","Encoding","Vectors","Video sequences","Video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","image representation","signal detection","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple description video coding","erasure errors","bit errors","compressive sensing","robust video transmission","lossy networks","packet erasure","ultra fine description granularity","low encoder complexity","resource-deprived video transmitter","time-varying adverse network condition","signal acquisition","coding strategy","adaptive sparse representation"]}],"abstract":"We propose a novel multiple description video coding (MDVC) technique for robust video transmission via lossy networks of both packet erasure and bit errors.

Other than video codecs like MPEG group, H.264/AVC utilizes variable block size for motion estimation and motion compensation, which results in better precision and compression efficiency. According to the mode decision built in H.264/AVC, the macroblocks of each frame are divided into intra mode, skip mode and others. For intra-mode macroblocks which contain more details, they are up-sampled by MAP (maximum a posteriori) since this method has best performance among existing super resolution algorithms. For macroblocks coded as skip mode, they are assumed to be highly correlated to macroblocks in the reference frame. Thus those blocks are duplicated from those referenced blocks. For the rest of the macroblocks, they not only have correspondence with blocks in other frames but also contain relatively complicated content so that they are further analyzed into variable block sizes, say 16x 16, 8x16,16x8, 8x8, 8x4, 4x8 and 4\u03c74. By adopting different up- sampling methods adaptively with variable block sizes, the proposed method saves computational efforts of smoother blocks for complicated blocks so that the overall complexity can be successfully reduced. Comparing to traditional frame-based up-sampling methods, the experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm provides a more efficient way to up- sample videos and is capable of preserving satisfactory visual quality.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12523760","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity upsampling technique for H.264","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity upsampling technique for H.264","confLoc":"Tainan, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"002361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029593S","chronDate":"6-9 Nov. 2011","isNumber":"6114275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105444","articleId":"6116059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6116085,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Chen","id":"38240966600"},{"name":"Robert W.

The egomotion estimation block computes the 3D UAV motion, taking as an input a 2D optical flow map that is constructed for each of the captured video frames. This work considers sparse optical flow estimation, and thus the navigation system that is developed includes a feature selection unit, which initially identifies the points of the optical flow map. This paper demonstrates that the feature selection process, and in particular the geometry of the selected feature set, decisively determines the overall system performance. Various computation schedules, which combine geometric constraints with a textural quality metric for the image features, are thus investigated. This paper shows that imposing appropriate distance constraints in the feature selection process significantly increases the output precision of the egomotion estimation unit, thus enabling accurate vision-based UAV self-navigation.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116114","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116114.pdf","startPage":"2357","endPage":"2360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature selection with geometric constraints for vision-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle navigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116114/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Feature selection with geometric constraints for vision-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle navigation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12504777","htmlLink":"/document/6116114/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature selection with geometric constraints for vision-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle navigation","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p2357angelopoulou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064289S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116114","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6116120,"authors":[{"name":"Junwu Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Junwu","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38239998500"},{"name":"Richard M.

In classical noise shaping, the spatial error information is compensated by adding it back into the whole DCWT domain, which allows the retained to coefficients have better capability to approximate the original image. The proposed perceptual noise shaping introduces a perceptual weight to the spatial errors. The weight involves the structural similarity (SSIM) measurement and other adjustment parameters to shape the spatial errors. Experimental results show that the perceptual noise shaping has better results for visual quality and provides higher SSIM index than classical noise shaping. For example, the proposed perceptual noise shaping achieves an overall SSIM of 0.891 for the 8 bit 512\u00d7512 \u201cbarbara\u201d compared to 0.878 in classical noise shaping when 5000 coefficients are retained.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116120","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116120.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","startPage":"237","endPage":"240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perceptual noise shaping in dual-tree complex wavelet transform for image coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6116120","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Perceptual noise shaping in dual-tree complex wavelet transform for image coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116120/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12504783","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6116120/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perceptual noise shaping in dual-tree complex wavelet transform for image coding","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p237zhu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051228S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6116171,"authors":[{"name":"Phong V.

Motion artifacts manifest in the STS images as spatial artifacts, which allows one to quantify motion-based distortion by using classical image-quality assessment techniques. ST-MAD estimates motion-based distortion by applying MAD's appearance-based model to compare the distorted video's STS images to the original video's STS images. This comparison is further adjusted by using optical-flow-derived weights designed to give greater precedence to fast-moving regions located toward the center of the video. Testing on the LIVE video database demonstrates that ST-MAD performs well in predicting video quality.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116171.pdf","startPage":"2505","endPage":"2508","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6116171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A spatiotemporal most-apparent-distortion model for video quality assessment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical distortion","Quality assessment","Databases","Image processing","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Algorithm design and analysis","Motion pictures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","image motion analysis","image sequences","spatiotemporal phenomena","video signal processing","visual databases","visual perception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatiotemporal most-apparent-distortion model","video quality assessment","spatiotemporal MAD","image-based algorithm","visual perception","motion artifacts","spatiotemporal images","STS images","time-based distorted video slices","spatial artifacts","motion-based distortion","image quality assessment techniques","appearance-based model","optical flow-derived weights","LIVE video database","video quality prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["video quality","image quality","distortion","quality assessment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A spatiotemporal most-apparent-distortion model for video quality assessment","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6116171/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12504834","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A spatiotemporal most-apparent-distortion model for video quality assessment","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p2505vu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097504S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116171","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6116172,"authors":[{"name":"Jincheol Park","affiliation":["Wireless Network Laboratory, Center for IT, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jincheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37407055100"},{"name":"Kalpana Seshadrinathan","affiliation":["Intel Laboratories, Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kalpana","lastName":"Seshadrinathan","id":"37400767200"},{"name":"Sanghoon Lee","affiliation":["Wireless Network Laboratory, Center for IT, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sanghoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281133200"},{"name":"Alan C.

In this paper, we propose a novel denoising scheme based on minimum mean square error (MMSE) filter in the 2D transform domain, which we call 2DTD-MMSE. The current input noisy frame is processed block-by-block, and for every block, the current noisy observation and multiple prediction blocks found by motion estimation (ME) in denoised previous frames as well as noisy future frames constitute a 2D observed representation array. Afterwards, 2D transform is applied to every block in the representation array, and every transform coefficient of current block is estimated by weighted average of the coefficients in the same frequency position of all the transformed blocks. The weighting coefficients are adaptively determined through MMSE for every block after the estimation of statistical parameters in the transform domain. Experimental results on commonly used test sequences demonstrate that the proposed 2DTD-MMSE achieves comparable or favorable performance when compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116189","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","startPage":"2573","endPage":"2576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116189.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Noise measurement","Noise","Image processing","Wavelet transforms","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","image denoising","image representation","least mean squares methods","motion estimation","statistical analysis","transforms","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video denoising","transform domain minimum mean square error","video processing systems","minimum mean square error filter","MMSE filter","2D transform domain","2DTD-MMSE","input noisy frame","motion estimation","2D observed representation array","frequency position","statistical parameter estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["video denoising","2D transform","MMSE filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Video denoising based on transform domain minimum mean square error","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116189/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6116189/","accessionNumber":"12504852","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video denoising based on transform domain minimum mean square error","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p2573dai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094246S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6116200,"authors":[{"name":"Huizhong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Huizhong","lastName":"Chen","id":"38240937200"},{"name":"Sam S.

Modified-CS-residual exploits the fact that the sparsity pattern of brain fMRI sequences and their signal values change slowly over time. It provides a fast, yet accurate, reconstruction approach that is able to accurately track the changes of the active pixels, while using only about 30% measurements per frame.

Therefore, band selection has been a common practice to reduce the dimensionality of the data space for cutting down the computational cost and alleviating from the Hughes phenomenon. This paper presents a new technique for band selection where a sparse representation of the hyperspectral image data is pursued through an existing algorithm, K-SVD, that decomposes the image data into the multiplication of an overcomplete dictionary (or signature matrix) and the coefficient matrix. The coefficient matrix, that possesses the sparsity property, reveals how importantly each band contributes in forming the hyperspectral data. By calculating the histogram of the coefficient matrix, we select the top K bands that appear more frequently than others to serve the need for dimensionality reduction and at the same time preserving the physical meaning of the selected bands. We refer to the proposed band selection algorithm based on sparse representation as SpaBS. Through experimental evaluation, we first use synthetic data to validate the sparsity property of the coefficient matrix. We then apply SpaBS on real hyperspectral data and use classification accuracy as a metric to evaluate its performance. Compared to other unsupervised band selection algorithms like PCA and ICA, SpaBS presents higher classification accuracy with a stable performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hyperspectral imaging","Sparse matrices","Dictionaries","Histograms","Conferences","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","image representation","principal component analysis","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse representation","band selection","hyperspectral images","spectral bands","data space","Hughes phenomenon","coefficient matrix","signature matrix","sparsity property","hyperspectral data","PCA","ICA","SpaBS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Band selection","Sparse representation","Hyperspectral imaging","Image classification"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116223","startPage":"2693","endPage":"2696","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116223.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse representation based band selection for hyperspectral images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sparse representation based band selection for hyperspectral images","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12504886","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6116223/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse representation based band selection for hyperspectral images","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p2693li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06028S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6116227,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Finally, we demonstrate with simulations using real PMMW images that the imaging duration can be dramatically reduced by acquiring only a few measurements compared to the size of the image.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116227.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116227","startPage":"2705","endPage":"2708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive passive millimeter-wave imaging","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116227/","displayDocTitle":"Compressive passive millimeter-wave imaging","htmlLink":"/document/6116227/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12504890","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive passive millimeter-wave imaging","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p2705babacan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048541S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6116259,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Li","id":"37089090756"},{"name":"Shiming Xiang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shiming","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37315878700"},{"name":"Haibo Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Haibo","lastName":"Wang","id":"38240322400"},{"name":"Chunhong Pan","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chunhong","lastName":"Pan","id":"37280268000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6116259","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":877},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Airplanes","Shape","Image segmentation","Image edge detection","Satellites","Transforms","Object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","object detection","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust airplane detection approach","satellite images","automatic target detection","visual saliency computation","symmetry detection","target location","saliency map"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["airplane detection","saliency","symmetry detection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6116259","abstract":"Automatic target detection in satellite images remains a challenging problem. The main difficulties lie in the cooccurrence of variations of target type, pose, and size in huge satellite image. In this paper, we propose a new airplane detection approach based on visual saliency computation and symmetry detection. The advantages are twofold. First, saliency and symmetry detection perform stably in obtaining target location and orientation information. Second, independent of target type, pose and size, saliency map and symmetry detection are computed only once. This saves a large amount of computational time but does not miss any targets. Experiments show that our method provides a promising way to detect airplanes in complex airport scenes.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116259","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116259.pdf","startPage":"2821","endPage":"2824","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust airplane detection in satellite images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Robust airplane detection in satellite images","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12504922","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6116259/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust airplane detection in satellite images","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p2821wei.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055532S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6116279,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Mueller","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Mueller","id":"38236185300"},{"name":"Peter Karasev","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Karasev","id":"37546909200"},{"name":"Ivan Kolesov","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Kolesov","id":"37602115200"},{"name":"Allen Tannenbaum","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Allen","lastName":"Tannenbaum","id":"37282608400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6116279","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical imaging","Training","Active contours","Image segmentation","Image color analysis","Optical computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","estimation theory","fires","image sequences","object detection","object tracking","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video analytics framework","amorphous anomaly detection","unstructured anomaly detection","video surveillance systems","rare events","human response","fire breaking out","automated detection algorithms","video data","amorphous detection","smoke-screen","offline supervised training phase","online Bayesian procedure","likelihood function","posterior estimate","candidate image-regions","candidate region","photometric observations","optimal-mass-transport optical-flow field","image regions tracking","active contours","video-fire-detection problem","detection performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly Detection","Video Analytics","Machine Vision","Active Contours"]}],"abstract":"Video surveillance systems are often used to detect anomalies: rare events which demand a human response, such as a fire breaking out. Automated detection algorithms enable vastly more video data to be processed than would be possible otherwise. This note presents a video analytics framework for the detection of amorphous and unstructured anomalies such as fire, targets in deep turbulence, or objects behind a smoke-screen. Our approach uses an off-line supervised training phase together with an on-line Bayesian procedure: we form a prior, compute a likelihood function, and then update the posterior estimate. The prior consists of candidate image-regions generated by a weak classifier. Likelihood of a candidate region containing an object of interest at each time step is computed from the photometric observations coupled with an optimal-mass-transport optical-flow field. The posterior is sequentially updated by tracking image regions over time and space using active contours thus extracting samples from a properly aligned batch of images. The general theory is applied to the video-fire-detection problem with excellent detection performance across substantially varying scenarios which are not used for training.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116279","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116279.pdf","startPage":"2945","endPage":"2948","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A video analytics framework for amorphous and unstructured anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6116279","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116279/","displayDocTitle":"A video analytics framework for amorphous and unstructured anomaly detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12504941","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6116279/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A video analytics framework for amorphous and unstructured anomaly detection","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p2945mueller.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079158S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6116287,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electronics Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, USA"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Ma","id":"37531764500"},{"name":"Pradhumna Shrestha","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electronics Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, USA"],"firstName":"Pradhumna","lastName":"Shrestha","id":"37719231900"},{"name":"Michael Hempel","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electronics Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Hempel","id":"37271230300"},{"name":"Dongming Peng","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electronics Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, USA"],"firstName":"Dongming","lastName":"Peng","id":"37266537300"},{"name":"Hamid Sharif","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Electronics Engineering, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, USA"],"firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Sharif","id":"37273496100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6116287","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6116287","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Entropy","Codecs","Transform coding","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational modeling","Communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","arithmetic codes","codecs","computational complexity","embedded systems","energy consumption","entropy","image coding","quadtrees","tree searching","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity image coder-decoder","approaching-entropy quadtree search code","embedded computing platforms","image codec","embedded processing systems","image coding methods","wavelet quadtree","adaptive arithmetic coding","JPEG2000 algorithms","energy consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image coding","quad-tree search model","embedded communication system"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a fast, simple and efficient image codec applicable for embedded processing systems. Among the existing image coding methods, wavelet quad-tree is a foundation leading to an efficient structure to encode images. By searching significant coefficients along quadtrees, an embedded efficient code can be obtained. In this work, we exploit hierarchical relations of the quad-tree structure in terms of searching entropy and present a quadtree searching model that is very close to the searching entropy. By applying this model, our codec surpasses SPIHT [1] by 0.2-0.4 db over wide code rates, and its performance is comparable to SPIHT with arithmetic coding and JPEG2000 [2]. With no additional overhead of arithmetic coding, our code is much faster and simpler than SPIHT with adaptive arithmetic coding and the more complicated JPEG2000 algorithms. This is a critical factor sought in embedded processing in communication systems where energy consumption and speed are priority concerns. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed codec is about twice as fast with very low computational overheads and comparable coding performances than existing algorithms.","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116287.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"300","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity image coder/decoder with an approaching-entropy quad-tree search code for embedded computing platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity image coder/decoder with an approaching-entropy quad-tree search code for embedded computing platforms","htmlLink":"/document/6116287/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12504949","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity image coder/decoder with an approaching-entropy quad-tree search code for embedded computing platforms","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p297ma.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088083S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6116295,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Li","affiliation":["College of Automation, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37405413700"},{"name":"Xiaoyuan Jing","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Software Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China","State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China","College of Automation, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyuan","lastName":"Jing","id":"37272934600"},{"name":"David Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279211300"},{"name":"Yongfang Yao","affiliation":["College of Automation, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Yongfang","lastName":"Yao","id":"37401262700"},{"name":"Lusha Bian","affiliation":["College of Automation, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Lusha","lastName":"Bian","id":"37411805700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6116295","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Vectors","Databases","Face","Training","Feature extraction","Face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image representation","image sampling","matrix algebra","principal component analysis","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernel discriminant feature extraction framework","mapped virtual sample","face recognition","nonsymmetric kernel matrix","kernel projection vector","MVS-based representative kernel method","kernel principal component analysis","generalized discriminant analysis","CASPEAL face database","classification performance","computational cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Kernel discriminant feature extraction framework","mapped virtual samples (MVS)","MVS-based kernel discriminant approaches","face recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6116295","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel kernel discriminant feature extraction framework based on the mapped virtual samples (MVS) for face recognition.

Nevertheless, laboratory studies are time consuming and expensive. Thus, researchers often choose to run informal studies or use objective quality measures, producing results which may not correlate well with human perception. In this paper we propose a cost-effective and convenient subjective quality measure called crowdMOS, obtained by having Internet workers participate in MOS (mean opinion score) subjective quality studies. Since these workers cannot be supervised, we propose methods for detecting and discarding inaccurate or malicious scores. To facilitate this process, we offer an open source set of tools for Amazon Mechanical Turk, which is an Internet marketplace for crowdsourcing. These tools completely automate the test design, score retrieval and statistical analysis, abstracting away the technical details of Mechanical Turk and ensuring a user-friendly, affordable and consistent test methodology. We demonstrate crowdMOS using data from the LIVE subjective quality image dataset, showing that it delivers accurate and repeatable results.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116320","startPage":"3097","endPage":"3100","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116320.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crowdsourcing subjective image quality evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Crowdsourcing subjective image quality evaluation","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6116320/","accessionNumber":"12504982","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116320/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crowdsourcing subjective image quality evaluation","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p3097ribeiro.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043864S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":6116337,"authors":[{"name":"Yusuke Monno","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Control Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Monno","id":"38234914300"},{"name":"Masayuki Tanaka","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Control Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayuki","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37291811600"},{"name":"Masatoshi Okutomi","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Control Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan"],"firstName":"Masatoshi","lastName":"Okutomi","id":"37270663800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6116337","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":433},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Image color analysis","Cameras","Conferences","Arrays","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image sampling","image segmentation","image sensors","optical filters","spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multispectral demosaicking algorithm","adaptive kernel upsampling algorithm","multispectral images","image sensor","color filter array","CFA","spectral component","direct adaptive kernel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multispectral imaging","color filter array","demosaicking","adaptive kernel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6116337","abstract":"Multispectral demosaicking, which estimates full multispectral images from raw data observed using a single image sensor with a color filter array (CFA), is a challenging task because each spectral component is severely undersampled.

A linear universal demosaicker consisting of space variant filters results from this formulation along with CFA designs that capture more image information than competing designs. This includes the interesting class of random RGB designs that outperform the Bayer CFA with nonlinear demosaickers in terms of PSNR and have a number of additional desirable properties. Furthermore, we present non-linear enhancements to our universal demosaicker and show them to be either related to compressive sensing or an alternate reconstruction algorithm for it.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116338.pdf","startPage":"3161","endPage":"3164","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116338","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6116338","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disregarding spectral overlap \u2014 A unified approach for demosaicking, compressive sensing and color filter array design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Equations","Bandwidth","Image reconstruction","Colored noise","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","filtering theory","image colour analysis","image segmentation","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectral overlap","demosaicking","compressive sensing","color filter array design","CFA design","luminance","chrominance spectra","photosite density","linear universal demosaicker","space variant filter","random RGB design","Bayer CFA","nonlinear demosaicker","PSNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Color Filter Array","Compressive Sensing","Universal Demosaick","Robust Demosaick"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Disregarding spectral overlap \u2014 A unified approach for demosaicking, compressive sensing and color filter array design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6116338/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12505000","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disregarding spectral overlap \u2014 A unified approach for demosaicking, compressive sensing and color filter array design","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p3161singh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04518S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6116360,"authors":[{"name":"J.

multiplexing is an efficient transmission technique for video streaming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication links due to its capability to support the high transmit rate. Nevertheless, the video quality is sensitive to packet losses resulting from channel fading and co-interference between transmit antennas in spatial multiplexing systems. Antenna selection techniques have been investigated to balance the spatial multiplexing gain and the link reliability. Herein, a novel cross-layer framework using dynamic antenna selection is proposed to control the multiplexing-diversity tradeoff with joint error-resilient source and channel coding. The cross-layer optimization is performed to optimize the physical, link, and application layers, and to minimize the end-to-end video distortion.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116361","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116361.pdf","startPage":"3245","endPage":"3248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer design for video streaming with dynamic antenna selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6116361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116361/","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer design for video streaming with dynamic antenna selection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12505023","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6116361/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer design for video streaming with dynamic antenna selection","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p3245chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052993S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116361","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6116363,"authors":[{"name":"Xianghang Liu","affiliation":["NICTA, Australia","University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Xianghang","lastName":"Liu","id":"38240610200"},{"name":"Jian Zhang","affiliation":["University of New South Wales, Australia","NICTA, Australia"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38196109900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6116363","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":325},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6116363","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Training","Videos","Humans","Conferences","Accuracy","Computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","image classification","image motion analysis","image recognition","image sampling","learning (artificial intelligence)","regression analysis","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human action recognition","multiple kernel combined method","multiple kernel learning","Gaussian process regression","GP classifier","GP regression","state-of-the-art technique","MKL based active learning method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Human action recognition","Gaussian Processes","Multiple Kernel Learning","Active Learning"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an active learning approach for recognizing human actions in videos based on multiple kernel combined method.

The selection of the sample is based on the heuristic feedback of the GP classifier.

In this metric, an image is filtered by the LOG operator, who acts like the classical receptive field, and the edge points are detected as the zero-crossings of the filtered image. Then the binary Non-shift Edge (NSE) map is derived to represent the strong edge structure remained in the distorted image. The perceptual quality is calculated by the ratio of NSE. The performance of rNSE in the scale-threshold plane shows similar frequency and threshold selectivity. Comparing with the existing well-designed metrics, the proposed rNSE performs equivalently in accuracy and consistency.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An image quality assessment metric based on Non-shift Edge","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116379","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116379.pdf","startPage":"3309","endPage":"3312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6116379","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"An image quality assessment metric based on Non-shift Edge","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6116379/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12505041","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An image quality assessment metric based on Non-shift Edge","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p3309xue.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044352S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6116394,"authors":[{"name":"Erwan Jouneau","affiliation":["Multitel a.s.b.l., Mons, Belgium"],"firstName":"Erwan","lastName":"Jouneau","id":"38234817700"},{"name":"Cyril Carincotte","affiliation":["Multitel a.s.b.l., Mons, Belgium"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Carincotte","id":"37282022600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6116394","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":313},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Tracking","Trajectory","Computational modeling","Roads","Vehicles","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed circuit television","road traffic","traffic engineering computing","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle-based tracking model","automatic anomaly detection","video scene","cars","traffic light sequence","particle-based trajectory","HDP-HMM model","scene activity recognition","road intersection dataset","fly abnormal event detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video surveillance","activity recognition","anomaly detection","HMM","HDP-HMM","topic models"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a new method to automatically discover recurrent activities occurring in a video scene, and to identify the temporal relations between these activities, e.g. to discover the different flows of cars at a road intersection, and to identify the traffic light sequence that governs these flows.

In high-performance hardware design, after high-level optimizations are exhausted, component level optimizations are employed such as building fast multipliers. Most fast multiplier architectures use some form of a Carry Save Adder (CSA) Tree, which is also called Column Compression (CC). We propose a new CC method called RoCoCo (Row and Column Compression), which also compresses the tree along rows so that the final adder is small and fast. Although CC results in faster multipliers in ASIC implementations, it is an assumption by designers that they are not the wisest choice on FPGAs. On the contrary, we were able to show through Xilinx synthesis results that RoCoCo (and sometimes Dadda CC) frequently offer faster multipliers than the built-in implementation of the multiply operation in Xilinx ISE synthesis tool.","doi":"10.1109/EWDTS.2011.6116419","publicationTitle":"2011 9th East-West Design & Test Symposium (EWDTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 9th East-West Design & Test Symposium (EWDTS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6107929/6116407/06116419.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6116407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EWDTS.2011.6116419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RoCoCo: Row and Column Compression for high-performance multiplication on FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 Sept. 2011","displayDocTitle":"RoCoCo: Row and Column Compression for high-performance multiplication on FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6116419/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461245","conferenceDate":"9-12 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RoCoCo: Row and Column Compression for high-performance multiplication on FPGAs","confLoc":"Sevastopol, Ukraine","sourcePdf":"ewdts1181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070196S","chronDate":"9-12 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6107929","isNumber":"6116407","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6107929","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6116407","articleId":"6116419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6116459,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Golam Sarwer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Windsor, Canada"],"firstName":"Mohammed Golam","lastName":"Sarwer","id":"37400433400"},{"name":"Q.

The enhanced cost function uses sum of absolute Hadamard-transformed differences (SATD) and variance of the residual block to estimate distortion part of the cost function. A threshold based large coefficients count is also used for estimating the bit-rate part.

In this paper, we propose an efficient uniform architecture for all of the 4\u00d74 intra directional modes. The architecture is implemented by a register array and a flexible reference sample selection technique. This novel architecture does not need to project the samples from the side reference to the main reference. Thus, it reduces the processing latency and the number of registers considerably.

Exploiting the inner parallelism of the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) boards, we dramatically accelerate the covariance matrices computation that plays a crucial role in the framework. In the experiments, we show the effectiveness and the efficiency of our pedestrian detection system, reaching a detection speed of 132 fps at VGA resolution.","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116531.pdf","startPage":"389","endPage":"392","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116531","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast FPGA-based architecture for pedestrian detection based on covariance matrices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast FPGA-based architecture for pedestrian detection based on covariance matrices","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116531/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6116531/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12523604","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast FPGA-based architecture for pedestrian detection based on covariance matrices","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p389martelli.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061907S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6116584,"authors":[{"name":"P.

This paper extends the HOG-EBGM face recognition algorithm to use color information. In HOG-EBGM, each face is represented by a graph described by HOG features at specific landmarks. The color extension of the method here proposed intends to make the algorithm robust against color changes, while keeping its former robustness against scale, position, rotation and intensity variations. In the paper, several color representations of the faces are studied. Also, to reduce the higher dimensionality of the new color features, a comparison of dimensionality reduction techniques is included. Results on the Experiment 4 of the Face Recognition Grand Challenge show that color HOG-EBGM outperforms the gray-scale version of the algorithm in all cases. The best results were obtained using the Opponent color space with LDA.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116673","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116673.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","startPage":"785","endPage":"788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Color HOG-EBGM for face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6116673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Color HOG-EBGM for face recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116673/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12536302","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6116673/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Color HOG-EBGM for face recognition","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p785monzo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074226S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6116682,"authors":[{"name":"Chuong T.

The main contribution of this paper is to consider characteristic of video source in user scheduling process. As a result, the proposed scheme can provide fair and satisfactory services to regular data users, while QoS of multimedia consumers is guaranteed. Since video source is delay-sensitive, in our framework, first we will estimate the transmitting time of each video packet. The estimation of transmission time serves dual purpose: one is to guarantee the transmission of any given video packet before it expires, and another one is to allow other unscheduled regular data users to access the channel when there is no pressing need to transmit any video packet for the video consumer. Simulation results show that the proposed user scheduling framework achieves high QoS performance for multimedia consumers.","doi":"10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116717","publicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6094293/6115588/06116717.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6115588","startPage":"945","endPage":"948","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fairness and QOS guaranteed user scheduling for multi-user MIMO broadcasting channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6116717","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fairness and QOS guaranteed user scheduling for multi-user MIMO broadcasting channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6116717/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12523743","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6116717/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fairness and QOS guaranteed user scheduling for multi-user MIMO broadcasting channel","confLoc":"Brussels, Belgium","sourcePdf":"p945liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098041S","chronDate":"11-14 Sept. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6094293","isNumber":"6115588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6094293","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6115588","articleId":"6116717","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6116719,"authors":[{"name":"YouZhe Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"YouZhe","lastName":"Fan","id":"38240983800"},{"name":"James She","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"She","id":"38238694100"},{"name":"Chi-ying Tsui","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chi-ying","lastName":"Tsui","id":"37278549800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1303-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1304-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1302-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2381-8549"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1522-4880"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1522-4880"}],"articleNumber":"6116719","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":153},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient iterative receiver for LDPC coded wireless IPTV system","abstract":"Multi-level superposition coded modulation (SCM) is a scalable technique for wireless video broadcast/ multicast, in which iterative turbo structures provide receivers with multi-resolution demodulations subject to a high complexity.

In this paper, a method is proposed to reduce the receiver complexity by using a sequential structure with a faster convergence for demodulation. In addition, the iterative demodulator and the LDPC decoder are jointly designed as a multi-loop iterative structure to reduce the decoding complexity.

But SMOTE algorithm ignores data distribution and density information which is important to synthesize minority examples. SMOTE algorithm cannot effectively eliminate the influence of noise either.

To solve this MAI problem, it is necessary to use a longer cyclic prefix length for orthogonality between different subchannels; however, this sacrifices system efficiency due to the cyclic prefix overhead. In this paper, we propose a group contention-based OFDMA to solve the MAI problem with an adequate cyclic prefix length and support a larger number of STAs. The STAs within the cyclic prefix duration that are synchronized to an access point (AP), are included in the same contending group and compete with other STAs of the group in transmitting packets. The proposed scheme allows for the adoption of an adequate cyclic prefix length without MAI, and is able to reduce the cyclic prefix overhead. In addition, since no packet errors are induced by MAI in any of the STAs, the STAs can transmit simultaneously without redundant short interframe spaces (SIFSs) and other control packets. Through analysis and simulation, we show that for a large number of STAs, the proposed scheme achieves higher throughput than 802.11 protocols and a conventional CSMA combined with OFDMA.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06117041.pdf","startPage":"648","endPage":"658","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.122211.102316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.122211.102316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group Contention-Based OFDMA MAC Protocol for Multiple Access Interference-Free in WLAN Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","Throughput","Multiaccess communication","Synchronization","Delay","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group contention-based OFDMA MAC protocol","multiple access interference-free","WLAN system","propagation delay","STA","cyclic prefix length","MAI-free","cyclic prefix overhead","access point","AP","packet transmission","packet error","short interframe space","SIFS","CSMA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","MAI","cyclic prefix","WLAN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117041/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Group Contention-Based OFDMA MAC Protocol for Multiple Access Interference-Free in WLAN Systems","volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6117041/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537082","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group Contention-Based OFDMA MAC Protocol for Multiple Access Interference-Free in WLAN Systems","sourcePdf":"648-tw1202-jung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070581S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6117041","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6117042,"authors":[{"name":"Kais Hassan","affiliation":["DOAE, DAscq, IEMN, Valenciennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6150275/6117042/6117042-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kais Hassan was born in 1975.

Recently, narrowband and later broadband analog network coding (ANC) were introduced as a simpler implementation of PNC. The ANC schemes require two time slots while in PNC three time slots are required for bi-directional communication between two nodes and hence ANC is more spectrum efficient. The coherent detection and self-information removal in ANC require accurate channel state information (CSI). {In this paper, we theoretically analyze the bit error rate (BER) performance with imperfect knowledge of CSI for broadband ANC using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), where the channel estimation error is modeled as a zero-mean complex Gaussian random variable. We investigate the BER performance for three cases: (i) the effect of imperfect self-information removal due to channel estimation (CE) error with fading tracking errors, (ii) the effect of imperfect self-information removal due to CE error without fading tracking errors}, and (iii) the ideal CE case. We discuss how, and by how much, our results obtained by theoretical analysis can be used for design of broadband ANC system with the imperfect knowledge of CSI. Our results show that imperfect channel estimation due to the noise effect has less impact on self-information removal than the imperfect channel estimation due to fading tracking errors. The tracking against fading is an important problem for accurate self-information removal as well as coherent detection and thus, the effect of channel time-selectivity is also theoretically studied. The achievable BER performance gains due to the polynomial time-domain channel interpolation are investigated using the derived close-form BER expressions and it was shown that the broadband ANC schemes with practical CE in a time- and frequency-selective channel should include a more sophisticated channel interpolation techniques since the impact of Doppler shift has prevalent effect on the achievable BER performance.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.122211.110326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06117044.pdf","endPage":"750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Analog Network Coding with Imperfect Channel Estimation in a Frequency-Selective Fading Channel","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.122211.110326","startPage":"742","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117044","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Analog Network Coding with Imperfect Channel Estimation in a Frequency-Selective Fading Channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117044/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537085","publicationDate":"February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6117044/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Analog Network Coding with Imperfect Channel Estimation in a Frequency-Selective Fading Channel","sourcePdf":"742-tw1202-gacanin.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128488S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6117044","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6117046,"authors":[{"name":"Steven W.

The model includes both perfect and imperfect channel state information based on channel estimation in the presence of noise. Three low-complexity methods are proposed for reducing the impact of overhead in the sum network throughput by partitioning users into orthogonal groups. The first method allocates spectrum to the groups equally, creating an imbalance in the sum rate of each group. The second proposed method allocates spectrum unequally among the groups to provide rate fairness. Finally, geographic grouping is proposed for cases where some receivers do not observe significant interference from other transmitters. For each partitioning method, the optimal solution not only requires a brute force search over all possible partitions, but also requires full channel state information, thereby defeating the purpose of partitioning. We therefore propose greedy methods to solve the problems, requiring no instantaneous channel knowledge. Simulations show that the proposed greedy methods switch from time-division to interference alignment as the coherence time of the channel increases, and have a small loss relative to optimal partitioning only at moderate coherence times.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Partitioning for Less Overhead in MIMO Interference Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.122211.101188","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06117046.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.122211.101188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117046","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117046/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","displayDocTitle":"User Partitioning for Less Overhead in MIMO Interference Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6117046/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537087","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Partitioning for Less Overhead in MIMO Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"592-tw1202-peters.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074459S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6117046","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6117047,"authors":[{"name":"Tianqi Wang","affiliation":["ECE Department, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6150275/6117047/6117047-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tianqi Wang received the B.E. degree in 2004 in Communications Engineering, from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, and the M.

While the achieved sum rate with IA is much higher than previously thought possible, the improvement comes at the cost of requiring network channel state information at the transmitters. This can be achieved by explicit feedback, a flexible yet potentially costly approach that incurs large overhead. In this paper we propose analog feedback as an alternative to limited feedback or reciprocity based alignment. We show that the full multiplexing gain observed with perfect channel knowledge is preserved by analog feedback and that the mean loss in sum rate is bounded by a constant when signal-to-noise ratio is comparable in both forward and feedback channels. When signal-to-noise ratios are not quite symmetric, a fraction of the multiplexing gain is achieved. We consider the overhead of training and feedback and use this framework to numerically optimize the system's effective throughput. We present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of IA with analog feedback, verify our theoretical analysis, and extend our conclusions on optimal training and feedback length.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.122211.101814","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06117048.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.122211.101814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","startPage":"626","endPage":"636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Alignment with Analog Channel State Feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interference Alignment with Analog Channel State Feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117048/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"11","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537089","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6117048/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Alignment with Analog Channel State Feedback","sourcePdf":"626-tw1202-ayach.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075123S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"138","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6117048","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":6117049,"authors":[{"name":"Yaser M.

However, \\revrr{with the increase in the number of relaying terminals (RTs), their coordination becomes a cumbersome task.} To address this drawback, in this paper an autonomous scheme is proposed whereby the RTs assign resource blocks (RBs) to incoming wireless terminals (WTs) in a way that minimizes the number of hit occurrences at which the same RB is assigned to multiple WTs. The proposed scheme uses cyclic group generators to determine the sequence of RBs to be assigned by each RT. This scheme is particularly beneficial in terminal relaying systems in which the distribution of the WTs is nonuniform and the channel quality indicators are not available. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs significantly better than currently available autonomous assignment schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6150275/06117049.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"647","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.122211.101840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.122211.101840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6150275","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Autonomous Resource Block Assignment Scheme for OFDMA-Based Relay-Assisted Cellular Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Generators","Wireless communication","Relays","Interference","OFDM","Time frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous resource block assignment","OFDMA-based relay-assisted cellular networks","wireless terminals","cyclic group generators","terminal relaying systems","channel quality indicators"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Terminal relaying","medium access control schemes","distributed resource block coordination","cyclic groups"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"An Autonomous Resource Block Assignment Scheme for OFDMA-Based Relay-Assisted Cellular Networks","volume":"11","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6117049/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537090","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Autonomous Resource Block Assignment Scheme for OFDMA-Based Relay-Assisted Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"637-tw1202-fouad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066923S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6150275","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6150275","articleId":"6117049","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6117050,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Rim Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6165622/6117050/6117050-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sang-Rim Lee (S'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005 and 2007.

For small-scale Rayleigh fadings, based on the proof of asymptotic normality, the mean and the variance of the instantaneous capacity were recently presented as a closed form solution. However, this solution is too complicated to be applied directly for obtaining the average ergodic capacity over a cell. In this work, we derive a simple and accurate expression for the ergodic capacity by utilizing the high signal to noise ratio (SNR) analysis. Our simple solution provides meaningful insight on how the ergodic capacity is affected as SNR, pathloss and antenna configurations change. Also it is useful for capturing quantitative performance measures such as the multiplexing gain and the power offset. In addition, we analyze the cell average ergodic capacity by taking into account the shadowing effect and the pathloss on the basis of our results on the small-scale fadings. These expressions lead to some insights on the performance of DAS under practical environments. Finally, numerical results confirm the validity of our analytical results.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.122211.110645","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless

finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation of electromagnetic interactions with semiconductor media. The model is formulated to be computationally efficient enough to be applied to FDTD simulations of photonic devices of complex structural geometry. The model developed here is built on top of a previous multi-level multi-electron (MLME) model we presented and the new model is called MLME-dynamical temperature (MLMEDT) model. The key developments here include the following. 1) Intraband transition terms with electron and hole temperature parameters that vary with time and space are introduced. 2) Rate equations for the explicit update of carrier temperature are formulated. A computationally efficient method is used to evaluate these carrier temperature rate equations which circumvent iterative procedures as well as the need to dynamically compute the chemical potential by presolving the relational functions required using dimensionless fitting functions. The temporal update of these fitting functions only needs the total carrier number densities, which are already obtained in the MLME model computation. 3) The changes in the total carrier kinetic energy density and carrier number density due to all interband processes such as stimulated emission/absorption and intraband processes such as free carrier absorption are tracked to drive the carrier temperature rate equations. 4) The thermal relaxation of the electron and hole temperatures to the lattice temperature and the thermal relaxation between electrons and holes are also included. In order to validate the approach, simulations of thermalization of nonequilibrium carrier distributions and nonlinear gain and refractive index dynamics in semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) are presented. Quantitative agreement with nonlinear gain dynamics experiments of SOA directly verifies the accuracy of the current approach. Additionally, a 2-D simulation of a microdisk laser is presented to depict how FDTD can be used to visualize the spatial profile of carrier temperatures. The computational time of the MLMEDT model is found to be only ~10% more than that of the MLME model, thus showing high computational efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2011.2182040","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/6145447/06117052.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2011.2182040","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145447","startPage":"772","endPage":"804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Highly Efficient Computational Model for FDTD Simulations of Ultrafast Electromagnetic Interactions With Semiconductor Media With Carrier Heating/Cooling Dynamics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Highly Efficient Computational Model for FDTD Simulations of Ultrafast Electromagnetic Interactions With Semiconductor Media With Carrier Heating/Cooling Dynamics","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117052/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"5","publicationDate":"March1, 2012","accessionNumber":"12524429","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6117052/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Highly Efficient Computational Model for FDTD Simulations of Ultrafast Electromagnetic Interactions With Semiconductor Media With Carrier Heating/Cooling Dynamics","sourcePdf":"jlt-ravi-2182040-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.208137S","chronDate":"March1,  2012","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6145447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6145447","articleId":"6117052","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6117060,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi Tian","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Michigan Technological University, Houghton, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6130608/6117060/6117060-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhi Tian (M'98\u2013SM'06) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, in 1994, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, in 1998 and 2000, respectively.","Since August 2000, she has been on the faculty of Michigan Technological University, Houghton, where she is a Professor.

Cognitive radios need to not only rapidly identify spectrum opportunities over very wide bandwidth, but also make reliable decisions in noise-uncertain environments. Cyclic spectrum sensing techniques work well under noise uncertainty, but require high-rate sampling which is very costly in the wideband regime. This paper develops robust and compressive wideband spectrum sensing techniques by exploiting the unique sparsity property of the two-dimensional cyclic spectra of communications signals. To do so, a new compressed sensing framework is proposed for extracting useful second-order statistics of wideband random signals from digital samples taken at sub-Nyquist rates. The time-varying cross-correlation functions of these compressive samples are formulated to reveal the cyclic spectrum, which is then used to simultaneously detect multiple signal sources over the entire wide band. Because the proposed wideband cyclic spectrum estimator utilizes all the cross-correlation terms of compressive samples to extract second-order statistics, it is also able to recover the power spectra of stationary signals as a special case, permitting lossless rate compression even for non-sparse signals. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed spectrum sensing algorithms against both sampling rate reduction and noise uncertainty in wireless networks.","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2181940","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6130608/06117060.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"69","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2181940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6130608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cyclic Feature Detection With Sub-Nyquist Sampling for Wideband Spectrum Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117060","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117060/","displayDocTitle":"Cyclic Feature Detection With Sub-Nyquist Sampling for Wideband Spectrum Sensing","volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471856","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117060/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cyclic Feature Detection With Sub-Nyquist Sampling for Wideband Spectrum Sensing","sourcePdf":"jstsp-tian-2181940-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090789S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6130608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"6130608","articleId":"6117060","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6117064,"authors":[{"name":"Akbar Ghobadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Urmia University, Urmia, Iran"],"firstName":"Akbar","lastName":"Ghobadi","id":"37987381200"},{"name":"Mojtaba Dehmollaian","affiliation":["Center of Excellence on Applied Electromagnetic Systems, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Dehmollaian","id":"37269788500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6117064","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":69,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3314},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Couplers","Dipole antennas","Polarization","Transmission line measurements","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coaxial cables","microstrip antennas","monopole antennas","omnidirectional antennas","wire antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["printed circularly polarized Y-shaped monopole antenna","omnidirectional Y-shaped monopole antenna","satellite applications","terrestrial applications","wire turnstile antennas","external coupler networks","coaxial cable"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circular polarization","omnidirectional","printed monopole"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117064","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2011.2181314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2011.2181314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6170612","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/6170612/06117064.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"25","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Printed Circularly Polarized Y-Shaped Monopole Antenna","abstract":"In this letter, a printed circularly polarized omnidirectional Y-shaped monopole antenna for possible satellite and terrestrial applications is presented.

A battery EV has a fairly limited driving range per charging and takes a long time to charge. Moreover, the existing technology only enables stationary charging, which means that an EV has to be parked during the duration of its charge replenishment. Contactless power transfer (CPT) system presents the opportunity of on-road charge replenishment of EVs. This paper presents case studies which illustrate the effect of on-road charge replenishment on driving range of an EV for varying levels of power transfer by the CPT system in urban and highway driving scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6296744/06117077.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"338","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2182015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2182015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6296744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Driving Range Extension of EV With On-Road Contactless Power Transfer\u2014A Case Study","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Vehicles","Mathematical model","System-on-a-chip","Windings","Integrated circuit modeling","Roads"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","inductive power transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EV driving range extension","electric vehicles","stationary charging","on-road contactless power transfer system","CPT system","on-road charge replenishment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contactless power transfer (CPT)","driving range extension","electric vehicle (EV) charging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Driving Range Extension of EV With On-Road Contactless Power Transfer\u2014A Case Study","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6117077/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","accessionNumber":"12968363","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Driving Range Extension of EV With On-Road Contactless Power Transfer\u2014A Case Study","sourcePdf":"tie-bauer-2182015-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083258S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6296744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"6296744","articleId":"6117077","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6117078,"authors":[{"name":"Handy Fortin Blanchette","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, \u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Handy Fortin","lastName":"Blanchette","id":"37562962900"},{"name":"Tarek Ould-Bachir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Tarek","lastName":"Ould-Bachir","id":"38268404800"},{"name":"Jean Pierre David","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean Pierre","lastName":"David","id":"37597095700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"6117078","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1922},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Transistors","Mathematical model","Capacitors","Integrated circuit modeling","State-space methods","Switching circuits","Iterative methods","Power conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","field programmable gate arrays","iterative methods","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state-space modeling approach","FPGA-based real-time simulation","high switching frequency power converters","state-space equation representation","switch model","switching devices","converter topology","programmable gate array device","Gauss-Seidel iterative method","network equation on-chip","two-level three-phase voltage source converter","switching frequency","nonideal boost converters","SPICE models","time 80 ns","frequency 200 kHz","time 75 ns","frequency 20 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Field programmable gate array (FPGA)","Gauss\u2013Seidel","iterative methods","power converter","real-time simulation","state space","switch model"]}],"abstract":"A comprehensive approach to the real-time simulation of power converters using a state-space representation is covered in this paper. Systematic formulations of state-space equations as well as a new switch model are presented. The proposed switch model exhibits a natural switching behavior, which is a valuable characteristic for the real-time simulation of power converters, thereby allowing individual treatment of switching devices irrespective of the converter topology. Successful implementations of the proposed switch model on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) device are reported, with two alternative approaches: 1) precomputing network equations for all switch state combinations and 2) solving network equations on-chip using the Gauss-Seidel iterative method. A two-level three-phase voltage source converter is implemented using the first approach, with a time step of 80 ns and a switching frequency of 200 kHz. Ideal and nonideal boost converters are also implemented on FPGA using the second approach, with a time step of 75 ns and a switching frequency of 20 kHz. Comparison with SPICE models shows that the proposed switch model offers very satisfactory accuracy and precision.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6230687/06117078.pdf","startPage":"4555","endPage":"4567","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A State-Space Modeling Approach for the FPGA-Based Real-Time Simulation of High Switching Frequency Power Converters","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2182021","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6230687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2182021","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117078/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A State-Space Modeling Approach for the FPGA-Based Real-Time Simulation of High Switching Frequency Power Converters","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"12834267","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A State-Space Modeling Approach for the FPGA-Based Real-Time Simulation of High Switching Frequency Power Converters","sourcePdf":"tie-blanchette-2182021-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050419S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","isNumber":"6230687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"52","articleId":"6117078","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6117079,"authors":[{"name":"Yasser Abdel-Rady I.

These methods, however, yield strong coupling among the active compensator, speed, and current control dynamics when applied to motor drives. To overcome these difficulties, a new reference-voltage-based active compensator (RVC) is proposed to mitigate the negative admittance effect in permanent-magnet synchronous motor drives with tight-speed regulation. The proposed RVC suppresses the interaction dynamics between the compensator and motor drive dynamics in the low- and medium-frequency regions and maintains stability and effective damping performance along the whole loading trajectory of the motor drive. In addition, the proposed compensator has a very simple structure, and it can easily be augmented to existing motor drives with minimal interactions with existing drive control strategy and parameters. A theoretical comparative analysis and test results are provided to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupled Reference-Voltage-Based Active DC-Link Stabilization for PMSM Drives With Tight-Speed Regulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2182013","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6230687/06117079.pdf","startPage":"4523","endPage":"4536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2182013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6230687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117079/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Decoupled Reference-Voltage-Based Active DC-Link Stabilization for PMSM Drives With Tight-Speed Regulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6117079/","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","accessionNumber":"12834268","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupled Reference-Voltage-Based Active DC-Link Stabilization for PMSM Drives With Tight-Speed Regulation","sourcePdf":"tie-mohamed-2182013-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095403S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6230687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6230687","articleId":"6117079","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6117080,"authors":[{"name":"Erdal Kayacan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6180074/6117080/6117080-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Erdal Kayacan (S'06) was born in Istanbul, Turkey, on January 7, 1980.

However, the parameters of the system still need to be optimized. For this purpose, the use of a sliding mode control theory-based learning algorithm is proposed in this paper. In the approach, instead of trying to minimize an error function, the parameters of the network are tuned by the proposed algorithm in such a way that the learning error is enforced to satisfy a stable equation. The update rules to achieve this are derived, and the convergence of the parameters is proved by Lyapunov stability method. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested by simulations on a Duffing oscillator and also by real-time experiments on a laboratory servo system. The results indicate that the given type-2 fuzzy neural network with the proposed learning algorithm can handle the uncertainties in a better way as compared to its type-1 counterpart. Moreover, it is computationally easier to implement in real-time systems.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2182017","startPage":"3510","endPage":"3520","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6180074/06117080.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2182017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6180074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sliding Mode Control Approach for Online Learning as Applied to Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Networks and Its Experimental Evaluation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","PD control","Fuzzy neural networks","Uncertainty","Fuzzy logic","Heuristic algorithms","Oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","learning systems","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","optimisation","stability","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online learning","type-2 fuzzy neural networks","experimental evaluation","type-2 fuzzy logic systems","type-1 FLS","optimization","sliding mode control theory-based learning algorithm","learning error","stable equation","Lyapunov stability method","Duffing oscillator","laboratory servo system","real-time systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Noise rejection","servo system","sliding mode control (SMC) theory","type-2 fuzzy logic systems (FLSs)","type-2 fuzzy sets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117080/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2012","displayDocTitle":"Sliding Mode Control Approach for Online Learning as Applied to Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Networks and Its Experimental Evaluation","volume":"59","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6117080/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2012","accessionNumber":"12656139","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sliding Mode Control Approach for Online Learning as Applied to Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Networks and Its Experimental Evaluation","sourcePdf":"tie-kayacan-2182017-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082576S","chronDate":"Sept.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6180074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6180074","articleId":"6117080","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":6117083,"authors":[{"name":"Shihua Li","affiliation":["School of Automation, South East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shihua","lastName":"Li","id":"37310205600"},{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["School of Automation, South East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37964654900"},{"name":"Wen-Hua Chen","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering, Loughborough University, Leicestershire, UK"],"firstName":"Wen-Hua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37279192700"},{"name":"Xisong Chen","affiliation":["School of Automation, South East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xisong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37833524200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0046"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9948"}],"articleNumber":"6117083","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":443,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":5320},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://ieee-ies.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117083","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Uncertainty","Control systems","MIMO","Feedback control","Stability analysis","Gain measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["observers","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["generalized extended state observer based control","mismatched uncertainties","ESOBC","single-input-single-output essential-integral-chain systems","practical engineering systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Disturbance compensation gain","disturbance rejection","generalized extended state observer based control (GESOBC)","mismatched uncertainties","multi-input\u2013multi-output (MIMO) system","nonintegral-chain system"]}],"abstract":"The standard extended state observer based control (ESOBC) method is only applicable for a class of single-input-single-output essential-integral-chain systems with matched uncertainties. It is noticed that systems with nonintegral-chain form and mismatched uncertainties are more general and widely exist in practical engineering systems, where the standard ESOBC method is no longer available. To this end, it is imperative to explore new ESOBC approach for these systems to extend its applicability. By appropriately choosing a disturbance compensation gain, a generalized ESOBC (GESOBC) method is proposed for nonintegral-chain systems subject to mismatched uncertainties without any coordinate transformations. The proposed method is able to extend to multi-input-multi-output systems with almost no modification.

We implemented two experiments for oversampling four times the bandwidth of an analog input signal using a multichannel time-interleaved arrangement. The sampling rate for each experiment was 2.08 gigasamples per second. In the first experiment, the optically sampled signal of each channel is digitized by a single ADC, whereas in the second, the signal is simultaneously digitized by four ADCs, and thereafter, the four digitized samples are averaged. A 20-dBm white-noise signal was superimposed on the input analog signal to test the implemented ADC systems. An improvement in the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio from 55.58 to 61.44 dB was achieved with averaging. Likewise, an improvement in the effective number of bits from 8.94 to 9.91 was achieved with averaging.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical pulses","Adaptive optics","Optical feedback","White noise","Optical coupling","Optical saturation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","data handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit resolution improvement","optically sampled time interleaved analog-to-digital converter","data averaging","multichannel time interleaved arrangement","digitized channel","signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data averaging","optically sampled signal","resolution improvement","time-interleaved analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2179335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6165484/06117085.pdf","startPage":"1099","endPage":"1104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2179335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit-Resolution Improvement of an Optically Sampled Time-Interleaved Analog-to-Digital Converter Based on Data Averaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117085","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Bit-Resolution Improvement of an Optically Sampled Time-Interleaved Analog-to-Digital Converter Based on Data Averaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117085/","volume":"61","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117085/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12576960","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit-Resolution Improvement of an Optically Sampled Time-Interleaved Analog-to-Digital Converter Based on Data Averaging","sourcePdf":"tim-villaangulo-2179335-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064032S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6165484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6165484","articleId":"6117085","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6117088,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Slavakis","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications Science and Technology, University of Peloponnese, Tripoli, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6145493/6117088/6117088-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Konstantinos Slavakis (M'08) received the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from the Tokyo Institute of Technology (TokyoTech), Tokyo, Japan, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.","He was with TokyoTech as a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Post-Doctoral Fellow from 2004 to 2006 and from 2006 to 2007, he was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens, Athens, Greece.

The problem is formulated in a general infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). In this context, a fairly large number of nonlinear multiregression models fall as special cases, including the linear case. Any convex, continuous, and not necessarily differentiable function can be used as a loss function in order to quantify the disagreement between the output of the system and the desired response. The only requirement is the subgradient of the adopted loss function to be available in an analytic form. To this end, we demonstrate a way to calculate the subgradients of robust loss functions, suitable for the multiregression task. As it is by now well documented, when dealing with online schemes in RKHS, the memory keeps increasing with each iteration step. To attack this problem, a simple sparsification strategy is utilized, which leads to an algorithmic scheme of linear complexity with respect to the number of unknown parameters. A convergence analysis of the technique, based on arguments of convex analysis, is also provided. To demonstrate the capacity of the proposed method, the multiregressor is applied to the multiaccess multiple-input multiple-output channel equalization task for a setting with poor resources and nonavailable channel information. Numerical results verify the potential of the method, when its performance is compared with those of the state-of-the-art linear techniques, which, in contrast, use space-time coding, more antenna elements, as well as full channel information.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2178321","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5962385/6145493/06117088.pdf","startPage":"260","endPage":"276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2011.2178321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6145493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Multiregression in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces: The Multiaccess MIMO Channel Case","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117088/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Multiregression in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces: The Multiaccess MIMO Channel Case","volume":"23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12509370","pubMedId":"24808505","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117088/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Multiregression in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces: The Multiaccess MIMO Channel Case","sourcePdf":"tnnls-slavakis-2178321-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.178764S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6145493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6145493","articleId":"6117088","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6117091,"authors":[{"name":"Zijian Wang","affiliation":["Monolithic Power Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6177741/6117091/6117091-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zijian Wang received the B.S. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, and the M.S. degree from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), Blacksburg, both in electrical engineering, in 2006 and 2010, respectively.","From 2007 to 2011, he was a Research Assistant in the Center for Power Electronics Systems, Virginia Tech.

Source separation of multiple datasets simultaneously is possible when the sources within each and every dataset are independent of one another and each source is dependent on at most one source within each of the other datasets. In addition to source separation, the IVA framework solves an essential problem of JBSS, namely the identification of the dependent sources across the datasets. We propose to use the multivariate Gaussian source prior to achieve JBSS of sources that are linearly dependent across datasets. Analysis within the paper yields the local stability conditions, nonidentifiability conditions, and induced Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound on the achievable interference to source ratio for IVA with multivariate Gaussian source priors. Additionally, by exploiting a novel nonorthogonal decoupling of the IVA cost function we introduce both Newton and quasi-Newton optimization algorithms for the general IVA framework.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6165492/06117092.pdf","startPage":"1672","endPage":"1683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2181836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2181836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165492","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Blind Source Separation With Multivariate Gaussian Model: Algorithms and Performance Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Cost function","Joints","Algorithm design and analysis","Mutual information","Correlation","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","Gaussian processes","interference (signal)","Newton method","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint blind source separation","multivariate Gaussian model","JBSS problem","independent vector analysis","IVA framework","multivariate Gaussian source","local stability condition","nonidentifiability condition","induced Cramer-Rao lower bound","interference","nonorthogonal decoupling","IVA cost function","quasiNewton optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Canonical correlation analysis","independent component analysis","independent vector analysis","joint blind source separation","permutation problem","second-order statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117092/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Joint Blind Source Separation With Multivariate Gaussian Model: Algorithms and Performance Analysis","volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6117092/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12591169","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Blind Source Separation With Multivariate Gaussian Model: Algorithms and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"tsp-anderson-2181836-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130657S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6165492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"6165492","articleId":"6117092","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6117093,"authors":[{"name":"Pouyan Parvazi","affiliation":["Communication Systems Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6165492/6117093/6117093-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pouyan Parvazi (M'06) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees, both in electrical engineering, from the University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 1998 and 2001, respectively.","Since November 2005, he has been with the Communication Systems Group, Darmstadt University of Technology, Darmstadt, Germany, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Our method utilizes the multiple shift-invariance property comprised in the signal model. We develop a new rank-reduction estimator which is formed as the weighted sum of the individual matrix polynomials obtained from individual shift-invariance equations. The uniqueness conditions for the proposed rank-reduction criteria are derived under the assumption that all samples are available. Moreover, a novel technique for the incomplete data case, where some samples are missing, is presented. In this case, the rank-reduction estimator may suffer from ambiguities. To overcome this problem, we propose an extension of the rank-reduction estimator that is based on polynomial intersection and the properties of the Sylvester matrix. The latter algorithm yields unique estimates of the damped harmonics. The proposed high-resolution techniques are search-free and therefore, they enjoy moderate computational complexity.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic

Two important metrics, i.e., throughput and delay, are studied in this paper. We first propose a simple and extendable decision model, i.e., the hybrid protocol model, for the secondary nodes to exploit spatial gap among primary transmissions for frequency reuse. Then, a framework for general cognitive networks is established based on the hybrid protocol model to analyze the occurrence of transmission opportunities for secondary nodes. We show that if the primary network operates in a generalized TDMA fashion, or employs a routing scheme such that traffic flows choose relays independently, then the hybrid protocol model suffices to guide the secondary network to achieve the same throughput and delay scaling as a standalone network without harming the performance of the primary network, as long as the secondary transmission range is smaller than the primary range in order. Our approach is general in the sense that we only make a few weak assumptions on both networks, and therefore it obtains a wide variety of results. We show secondary networks can obtain the same order of throughput and delay as standalone networks when primary networks are classic static networks, networks with random walk mobility, hybrid networks, multicast networks, CSMA networks, networks with general mobility, or clustered networks. Our work presents a relatively complete picture of the performance scaling of cognitive networks and provides fundamental insight on the design of them.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117099/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"11 October 2012","accessionNumber":"13039033","displayDocTitle":"Capacity Scaling of General Cognitive Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity Scaling of General Cognitive Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-wang-2180400-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058407S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","isNumber":"6329526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"36","articleId":"6117099","onlineDate":"28 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6117119,"authors":[{"name":"Hagen St\u00fcbing","affiliation":["Advanced Active Safety, Adam Opel AG, Russelsheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Hagen","lastName":"St\u00fcbing","id":"37399494800"},{"name":"Jonas Firl","affiliation":["Advanced Active Safety, Adam Opel AG, Russelsheim, Germany"],"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Firl","id":"38232739100"},{"name":"Sorin A.

Sender authentication, message integrity as well as plausibility of the message content represent one of the key aspects in this domain. While the first two requirements are covered by means of cryptography, the latter is still subject to current research. Recent works in the area of vehicle behavior analysis include promising approaches, but are still prone to errors in case of highly dynamic driving maneuvers. In this work we present a novel two-stage verification process for reliable Car-to-X mobility data verification. The first stage consists of a mobility estimator realized by a Kalman filter. The Kalman filter is thereby used to evaluate received mobility data with respect to the path history of vehicles. In the second stage a plausibility check for highly dynamic traffic situations is applied using probabilistic traffic maneuver recognition based on Hidden Markov Models. The overall framework is implemented and its effectiveness is evaluated by means of real world experiments.","doi":"10.1109/VNC.2011.6117119","startPage":"17","endPage":"24","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6107923/6117102/06117119.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VNC.2011.6117119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-stage verification process for Car-to-X mobility data based on path prediction and probabilistic maneuver recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Vehicles","Kalman filters","Vehicle dynamics","Data models","Noise","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cryptography","hidden Markov models","Kalman filters","mobility management (mobile radio)","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-stage verification","car-to-X mobility data verification","path prediction","probabilistic maneuver recognition","security","sender authentication","message integrity","message content","cryptography","vehicle behavior analysis","mobility estimator","Kalman filter","dynamic traffic situations","probabilistic traffic maneuver recognition","hidden Markov models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Car-to-X Communication","Security","Mobility Data Verfication","Maneuver Recognition","Hidden Markov Model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A two-stage verification process for Car-to-X mobility data based on path prediction and probabilistic maneuver recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117119/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"14-16 Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461120","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-stage verification process for Car-to-X mobility data based on path prediction and probabilistic maneuver recognition","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"p17stubing.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094646S","chronDate":"14-16 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6107923","isNumber":"6117102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6107923","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6117102","articleId":"6117119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6117121,"authors":[{"name":"Tayyar Rzayev","affiliation":["Wireless Innovation Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Tayyar","lastName":"Rzayev","id":"38232740300"},{"name":"Yuan Shi","affiliation":["Wireless Innovation Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Shi","id":"38238259300"},{"name":"Anastasios Vafeiadis","affiliation":["Wireless Innovation Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Vafeiadis","id":"38232739700"},{"name":"Srikanth Pagadarai","affiliation":["Wireless Innovation Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Worcester, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Srikanth","lastName":"Pagadarai","id":"37402675600"},{"name":"Alexander M.

Due to the high level of mobility for vehicles operating under highway conditions, coupled with spatially variant spectrum allocation across a large geographical region, we envision that future vehicular communications will employ a form of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) in order to facilitate wireless transmissions between vehicles and with roadside infrastructure. In particular, the VDSA concept will be enabled by a combination of software-defined radio (SDR) technology, spectral occupancy databases, and machine learning techniques for enabling network automation. A vehicular networking scenario is substantially different relative to a generic mobile scenario with respect to the high level of mobility involved, the predictable trajectories of the vehicular traffic, and the overall scale of the network range. Consequently, the proposed architecture is designed to enable VDSA in a more flexible wireless spectrum environment by leveraging the cognitive radio concept and existing wireless spectrum databases actively being developed while simultaneously being compatible with current spectrum regulations. Regarding practical issues for vehicular communications, vehicle mobility is taken into account in order to ensure primary user protection, databases and channel priority schemes are used in order to record temporal and spatial channel heterogeneity, and vehicle path prediction techniques are employed in order to enhance channel access in this operating environment. Specifically, we show the advantages of employing the proposed learning architecture via a case study where reinforcement learning is used in order to achieve intelligent channel selection within a realistic VDSA environment. Moreover, performance enhancements in terms of channel switching times, interference, and throughput are shown via computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/VNC.2011.6117122","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6107923/6117102/06117122.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VNC.2011.6117122","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)","startPage":"39","endPage":"46","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On optimizing vehicular dynamic spectrum access networks: Automation and learning in mobile wireless environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117122","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"On optimizing vehicular dynamic spectrum access networks: Automation and learning in mobile wireless environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117122/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117122/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461123","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"14-16 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On optimizing vehicular dynamic spectrum access networks: Automation and learning in mobile wireless environments","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"p39chen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056098S","chronDate":"14-16 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6107923","isNumber":"6117102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6107923","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6117102","articleId":"6117122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6117123,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Di Felice","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Di Felice","id":"37317892000"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy Chowdhury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik Roy","lastName":"Chowdhury","id":"37317894400"},{"name":"Luciano Bononi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Bononi","id":"37265458500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0047-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0049-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0048-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9865"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9857"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-9857"}],"articleNumber":"6117123","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":927},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117123","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Sensors","Availability","Accuracy","Urban areas","Correlation","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","telecommunication network management","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum management","cognitive vehicular ad hoc networks","cognitive radio technology","on-demand spectrum utilization","moving vehicle","collaborative spectrum management framework"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VNC.2011.6117123","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference (VNC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6107923/6117102/06117123.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VNC.2011.6117123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spectrum management in cognitive Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","abstract":"In recent years, Cognitive Radio (CR) technology has received significant attention from the research community as it enables on-demand spectrum utilization, based on the requests of the end-users. An interesting application area of CR technology is Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). In such networks, several innovative services and applications based on inter-vehicular communication have strict requirements in terms of bandwidth and delay, which might not be guaranteed by a fixed spectrum allocation paradigm. In this paper, we propose two key contributions pertaining to CR-VANETs: (i) an experimental study of the spectrum availability and sensing accuracy in a moving vehicle and (ii) a collaborative spectrum management framework (called Cog-V2V), which allows the vehicles to share spectrum information, and to detect spectrum opportunities in the licensed band. As part of this framework, we design a collaborative sensing and decision algorithm, enabling the vehicles to share spectrum information and to know in advance the spectrum availability at future locations along their motion paths. The simulation results, produced through a novel integrated simulation platform for CR networks, reveal significant improvements of Cog-V2V in sensing accuracy and pair-wise communication performance compared to classical fixed spectrum approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117123/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12461124","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","conferenceDate":"14-16 Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117123/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative spectrum management in cognitive Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative spectrum management in cognitive Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"p47difelice.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064381S","chronDate":"14-16 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6107923","isNumber":"6117102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6107923","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6117102","articleId":"6117123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6117125,"authors":[{"name":"Sandesh Uppoor","affiliation":["INSA-Lyon, CITI, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, INRIA, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Sandesh","lastName":"Uppoor","id":"37589711100"},{"name":"Marco Fiore","affiliation":["INSA-Lyon, CITI, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, INRIA, Villeurbanne, France"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Fiore","id":"38480403700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0047-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0049-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0048-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-9865"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-9857"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-9857"}],"articleNumber":"6117125","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":93,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Vehicles","Topology","Microscopy","Cities and towns","Layout","Urban areas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","mobility management (mobile radio)","next generation networks","road traffic","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["urban vehicular mobility","networking research","telecommunication networking paradigms","next-generation cellular networks","vehicular access","pure vehicular ad hoc networks","opportunistic disruption-tolerant networks","vehicular mobility modeling","car traffic trace","time 24 hour"]}],"abstract":"Simulation is the tool of choice for the large-scale performance evaluation of upcoming telecommunication networking paradigms that involve users aboard vehicles, such as next-generation cellular networks for vehicular access, pure vehicular ad hoc networks, and opportunistic disruption-tolerant networks.

Void free and reliable galvanic copper deposition is essential for yield and lifetime of microelectronic devices. Different TSV applications, as chip stacking and interposer, require different TSV dimensions. This demands high flexibility and applicability for small and large via sizes in the galvanic filling process. This paper compares two different acidic copper systems in respect of their TSV filling properties. Both systems mainly differ in the leveler compound. System A shows super-conformal filling behavior and System B bottom-up filling. The properties of copper being deposited using System A and B respectively vary further in respect of copper grain size homogeneity, stress of the copper deposits, recrystallization temperature and incorporation of additives. The influence of organic copper additives on the mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties of the copper deposits is discussed. Using the example of System B, filling aspects as well as process optimization will be outlined. For process optimization electrochemical potential characteristics (E vs. t) during the filling process are used to identify important filling steps. Filling examples for small as well as large TSV feature sizes will be discussed.","doi":"10.1109/IMPACT.2011.6117182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMPACT.2011.6117182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117151","startPage":"355","endPage":"358","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th International Microsystems, Packaging, Assembly and Circuits Technology Conference (IMPACT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6108828/6117151/06117182.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 6th International Microsystems, Packaging, Assembly and Circuits Technology Conference (IMPACT)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117182","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filling","Copper","Through-silicon vias","System-on-a-chip","Current density","Additives","Stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["additives","copper","electrochemistry","galvanising","integrated circuit yield","recrystallisation","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["galvanic copper deposition","filling through silicon via","3D-integration","microelectronic device yield","microelectronic device lifetime","chip stacking","interposer","galvanic filling process","acidic copper system","super-conformal filling behavior","bottom-up filling","copper grain size homogeneity","copper deposit stress","recrystallization temperature","additive incorporation","organic copper additive","mechanical property","thermal property","electrical property","process optimization","electrochemical potential characteristics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Filling TSV of different dimension using galvanic copper deposition","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461533","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6117182/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117182/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filling TSV of different dimension using galvanic copper deposition","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"EU0921.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065964S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6108828","isNumber":"6117151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6108828","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6117151","articleId":"6117182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6117235,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Chyun An","affiliation":["Electronics and Optoelectronics Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Chutung, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chao-Chyun","lastName":"An","id":"37825080100"},{"name":"Ming-Hsien Wu","affiliation":["Electronics and Optoelectronics Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Chutung, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Hsien","lastName":"Wu","id":"37067083800"},{"name":"Yu-Wei Huang","affiliation":["Electronics and Optoelectronics Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Chutung, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Wei","lastName":"Huang","id":"37291620200"},{"name":"Tai-Hong Chen","affiliation":["Electronics and Optoelectronics Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Chutung, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tai-Hong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37290411100"},{"name":"Chia-Hsin Chao","affiliation":["Electronics and Optoelectronics Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Chutung, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Hsin","lastName":"Chao","id":"37268521500"},{"name":"Wen-Yung Yeh","affiliation":["Electronics and Optoelectronics Research Laboratories, Industrial Technology Research Institute, Chutung, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Yung","lastName":"Yeh","id":"37302810500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1389-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1387-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1388-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-5942"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-5934"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2150-5934"}],"articleNumber":"6117235","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2581},"abstract":"Flip chip assembly technology is an attractive solution for high I/O density and fine-pitch microelectronics packaging. Recently, high efficient GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have undergone a rapid development and flip chip bonding has been widely applied to fabricate high-brightness GaN micro-LED arrays. The flip chip GaN LED has some advantages over the traditional top-emission LED, including improved current spreading, higher light extraction efficiency, better thermal dissipation capability and the potential of further optical component integration. With the advantages of flip chip assembly, micro-LED (\u03bcLED) arrays with high I/O density can be performed with improved luminous efficiency than conventional p-side-up micro-LED arrays and are suitable for many potential applications, such as micro-displays, bio-photonics and visible light communications (VLC), etc. In particular, \u03bcLED array based self-emissive micro-display has the promising to achieve high brightness and contrast, reliability, long-life and compactness, which conventional micro-displays like LCD, OLED, etc, cannot compete with. In this study, GaN micro-LED array device with flip chip assembly package process was presented. The bonding quality of flip chip high density micro-LED array is tested by daisy chain test. The p-n junction tests of the devices are measured for electrical characteristics. The illumination condition of each micro-diode pixel was examined under a forward bias. Failure mode analysis was performed using cross sectioning and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Finally, the fully packaged micro-LED array device is demonstrated as a prototype of dice projector system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th International Microsystems, Packaging, Assembly and Circuits Technology Conference (IMPACT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6108828/6117151/06117235.pdf","startPage":"336","endPage":"338","publicationTitle":"2011 6th International Microsystems, Packaging, Assembly and Circuits Technology Conference (IMPACT)","doi":"10.1109/IMPACT.2011.6117235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMPACT.2011.6117235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on flip chip assembly of high density micro-LED array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Silicon","Bonding","Flip chip","Gallium nitride","Substrates","Light emitting diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronics packaging","flip-chip devices","gallium compounds","light emitting diodes","p-n junctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high density micro-LED array","microelectronics packaging","GaN-based light-emitting diodes","flip chip bonding","high-brightness GaN micro-LED arrays","flip chip GaN LED","thermal dissipation capability","optical component integration","bio-photonics","visible light communication","flip chip assembly package process","p-n junction tests","electrical characteristics","micro-diode pixel","failure mode analysis","scanning electron microscopy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Study on flip chip assembly of high density micro-LED array","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117235/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461567","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on flip chip assembly of high density micro-LED array","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"TW0471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039474S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6108828","isNumber":"6117151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6108828","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6117151","articleId":"6117235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6117269,"authors":[{"name":"De-Shin Liu","affiliation":["Advanced Institute of Manufacturing for High-tech Innovations and Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"De-Shin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37654029800"},{"name":"I-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Advanced Institute of Manufacturing for High-tech Innovations and Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"firstName":"I-Hung","lastName":"Lin","id":"38013795400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1389-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1387-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1388-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2150-5942"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2150-5934"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2150-5934"}],"articleNumber":"6117269","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":266},"abstract":"The moisture diffusion phenomenon of UV-curable adhesive apply to the packaging of organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) were investigated.

As regards to improve the moisture-resistant capability of the materials for encapsulating, one possible way is to add particles into UV-curable sealing adhesive. In this study, a numerical simulation model that contained randomly distributed particles into heterogeneous epoxy resin has been developed. The commercial software MATLAB is employed to generate the location of randomly distributed particles and the commercial software ANSYS based on the finite element method is employed to analyze moisture diffusion in containing multiple randomly distributed particles. Furthermore, this model is then employed to investigate the relationship between the volume fraction of the particles in the resin composite and the rate of moisture diffusion. The simulation results show that moisture diffusion is retarded significantly as the volume fraction of particles increases. Moreover, the adhesive with high volume fraction of particle exhibits superior moisture-resistant capability. However, excessively add particles makes inferior penetrability. Therefore, adding proper volume percentage of particle into UV-curable adhesive could be expected better using in engineering applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th International Microsystems, Packaging, Assembly and Circuits Technology Conference (IMPACT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6108828/6117151/06117269.pdf","startPage":"79","endPage":"82","publicationTitle":"2011 6th International Microsystems, Packaging, Assembly and Circuits Technology Conference (IMPACT)","doi":"10.1109/IMPACT.2011.6117269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMPACT.2011.6117269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of moisture diffusion in heterogeneous epoxy resin containing multiple randomly distributed particles using finite element method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Moisture","Epoxy resins","Finite element methods","Bonding","Humidity","Electronic packaging thermal management","Atmospheric modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adhesives","diffusion","electronics packaging","finite element analysis","moisture","organic light emitting diodes","resins","sealing materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moisture diffusion","heterogeneous epoxy resin","multiple randomly distributed particle","finite element method","organic light-emitting device","OLED package","moisture permeation","moisture-resistant capability","UV-curable sealing adhesive","numerical simulation model","MATLAB software","ANSYS software","resin composite","inferior penetrability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of moisture diffusion in heterogeneous epoxy resin containing multiple randomly distributed particles using finite element method","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117269/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461601","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of moisture diffusion in heterogeneous epoxy resin containing multiple randomly distributed particles using finite element method","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"TW0901.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062131S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6108828","isNumber":"6117151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6108828","xplore-issue":"6117151","articleId":"6117269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6117317,"authors":[{"name":"Oleg Garitselov","affiliation":["University of North Texas, Denton, USA"],"firstName":"Oleg","lastName":"Garitselov","id":"37860325500"},{"name":"Saraju P.

This paper presents the design of an FPM catering to both the needs using a hierarchical design approach. The FPM supports nine parallel SP multiplications every cycle with a latency of two cycles and one DP/EP multiplication every cycle with a latency of three cycles. The FPM is architected to support all four IEEE rounding modes. Compared to other FPMs that support multiple precision and SIMD processing, our FPM achieves 9x throughput for vectored SP mode without penalising the throughput for DP/EP modes. This improvement in performance is achieved at a modest cost of 30 percent more area and 11 percent more power. The modular architecture of the proposed FPM results in significant power reduction upto 80 percent for scalar SP mode.","doi":"10.1109/ISED.2011.14","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Electronic System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Electronic System Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/6117294/6117297/06117324.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISED.2011.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fully Pipelined Modular Multiple Precision Floating Point Multiplier with Vector Support","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117324/","displayDocTitle":"A Fully Pipelined Modular Multiple Precision Floating Point Multiplier with Vector Support","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12489516","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117324/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fully Pipelined Modular Multiple Precision Floating Point Multiplier with Vector Support","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"4570a045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041217S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6117294","isNumber":"6117297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6117294","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6117297","articleId":"6117324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6117326,"authors":[{"name":"T.C.

In this paper we propose the use of rise time of word-line signal as a measure to reduce the impact of the process variations on the SRAM cells. Simulation results show that using a higher rise time resulted in drastic reduction in the number of cells that fail to read or write. Number of cells that can successfully write or read improved from 82% to 98.2% and 90% to 98.8% respectively.

Novel Low Power Noise Tolerant High Performance Dynamic Feed through Logic Design Technique","abstract":"In this paper a new design technique is proposed using FTL (Feed through Logic) concept for high performance dynamic CMOS logic with high noise immunity and low power. FTL improves the performance of arithmetic circuits with a very long logic depth. In spite of its performance advantage, FTL suffers from reduced noise margin, direct path current and non-zero nominal low output voltage. The proposed technique removes the charge sharing problem and increases the noise immunity of high performance dynamic FTL circuit. In order to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed technique a high performance dynamic 2-input AND gate is designed and realized using the proposed technique. A comparative analysis of the proposed technique, Feed Through Logic and Domino Logic has been done in terms of noise immunity, power dissipation and delay.

Such bugs may remain in the implementation due to shortfall in conventional testing and are referred to as corner case bugs. Runtime monitoring of hardware designs used in critical systems is required to take care of corner case bugs. The basic idea behind runtime monitoring is to identify certain critical design invariants and write assertions, which monitor these invariants during runtime. This paper describes a tool that translates properties written in PSL (Property Specification Language) into synthesizable VHDL called as monitors. These monitors can be synthesized along with the actual design. Automata theoretic approach is used for this translation.","doi":"10.1109/ISED.2011.70","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Electronic System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Electronic System Design","pdfPath":"/iel5/6117294/6117297/06117345.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISED.2011.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117297","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Construction of Runtime Monitors for FPGA Based Designs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117345/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Construction of Runtime Monitors for FPGA Based Designs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117345/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12489537","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Construction of Runtime Monitors for FPGA Based Designs","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"4570a164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078254S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6117294","isNumber":"6117297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6117294","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6117297","articleId":"6117345","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6117346,"authors":[{"name":"K.P.

The transition locations are identified by comparing sample variance with a threshold value. Two different kalman filters are used to denoise the signal, one in the vicinity of transition region and other for non transition region. The performance of the algorithm is compared with adaptive moving average filter, standard kalman filter, standard multiple model kalman filter.

In this paper, we focus on the Optimal Sampling Frequency Assignment (OSFA) in a real-time wireless sensor networks (RTWSN). An appropriate OSFA should both guarantee a good quality of real-time service and efficiently utilize the limited network resources as well. We propose a distributed optimization algorithm, called Lazy Schema (LySa), to obtain the optimal sampling rates of source nodes with low cost. The central idea is that redundancy reporting and constant adjust step size result in the excessive communicate overhead in iteration process. LySa adopts self-adaptive reporting rates and dynamically adjusts step size to reduce the traffic cost and accelerate the convergence of optimal solution. We have evaluated LySa together with related mainstream algorithms. The results demonstrate that LySa outperforms current state-of-art approaches in terms of low cost, high efficiency and scalability in RTWSN.","doi":"10.1109/MSN.2011.41","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSN.2011.41","startPage":"152","endPage":"159","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6117296/6117374/06117407.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lazy Schema: An Optimal Sampling Frequency Assignment for Real-Time Sensor Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Lazy Schema: An Optimal Sampling Frequency Assignment for Real-Time Sensor Systems","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117407/","accessionNumber":"12489763","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117407/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lazy Schema: An Optimal Sampling Frequency Assignment for Real-Time Sensor Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4610a152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060494S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6117296","isNumber":"6117374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6117296","xplore-issue":"6117374","articleId":"6117407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6117412,"authors":[{"name":"Emilija Miletic","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Emilija","lastName":"Miletic","id":"38294596000"},{"name":"Klaus Tittelbach-Helmrich","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Tittelbach-Helmrich","id":"38277203600"},{"name":"Goran Panic","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt, Germany"],"firstName":"Goran","lastName":"Panic","id":"37991657800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2178-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4610-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6117412","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","MIMO","Hardware","Media Access Protocol","Baseband","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","MIMO communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-capable 802.11","compliant MAC protocol implementation","MIMAX","MIMO for maximum reliability and performance","SDL","specification and description language","hardware-software partitioning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["802.11a","MAC","MIMAX","SDL","HW/SW"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we are investigating the performance of a 802.11a compliant MAC protocol used in MIMAX (Mimo for Maximum reliability and performance) system.

With the increasing spectrum shortage in WSN, the Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSN) is proposed to employ the Cognitive Radio (CR) technology to utilize the spectrum resources dynamically (i.e., Dynamic Spectrum Access, DSA). However, it's a challenge to increase the delivery rate and the throughput in the CRSN because of the power and process restrictions. In this paper, with the consideration of the spectrum idle condition and communication capability, a novel DSA strategy based on the Real-time Usability (DSARU) is presented. And the energy-saving updating algorithm of the spectrum real-time usability is proposed to sense the spectrum changes. Based on the IEEE 802.15.4, DSARU simulation model and experiment system are set up to evaluate the transmission performances. Both simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the DSARU strategy can efficiently increase the delivery rate and throughput, especially under the condition of spectrum interference.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117430/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12489786","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117430/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Spectrum Access Strategy Based on Real-Time Usability in Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Spectrum Access Strategy Based on Real-Time Usability in Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4610a318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053878S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6117296","isNumber":"6117374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6117296","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6117374","articleId":"6117430","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6117431,"authors":[{"name":"Henan Zhao","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, CN"],"firstName":"Henan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38238079500"},{"name":"Liusheng Huang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, CN"],"firstName":"Liusheng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37280053300"},{"name":"Yindong Zhang","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, CN"],"firstName":"Yindong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405826700"},{"name":"Hongli Xu","affiliation":["University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, CN"],"firstName":"Hongli","lastName":"Xu","id":"37291048300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2178-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4610-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6117431","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":234},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Numerical stability","Cognitive radio","Interference","Routing","Ad hoc networks","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","greedy algorithms","radio spectrum management","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stable joint routing scheme","cognitive radio ad hoc network performance","cognitive user","spectrum scheduling problem","greedy strategy","distributed stability algorithm","route stability","DSA","SAMER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio Networks","routing","spectrum scheduling","multi-sessions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117431","doi":"10.1109/MSN.2011.11","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","abstract":"In CRAHNs (Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks), cognitive users coexist with primary users who have priority in accessing a set of licensed bands. Cognitive users can use those bands only when the primary users don't occupied them. And also, these occupied bands should be vacated immediately as soon as corresponding primary users wake up. Therefore, the more frequently primary user changes its activities, the less stable spectrum availability the cognitive user has. This makes route stability become one of the most concerned problems in CRAHNs. Some works have considered such kind of stability, but the overall performance of the network hasn't been taken into account when multiple cognitive user pairs (also called multi-sessions in the following) have routing requirements. Thus, in this paper, we investigate a joint routing and spectrum scheduling problem, in which multi-sessions exist, and the route stability is required. To solve this problem, a greedy strategy named Distributed Stability Algorithm (DSA) is proposed, which aims to maximize the route stability of the session, whose route stability is the minimal.

WSN enables novel and attractive solutions for information gathering across the spectrum of endeavour including transportation, business, health-care, industrial automation, and environmental monitoring. Despite these advances, the exponentially increasing data extracted from WSN is not getting adequate use due to the lack of expertise, time and money with which the data might be better explored and stored for future use. The next generation of WSN will benefit when sensor data is added to blogs, virtual communities, and social network applications. This transformation of data derived from sensor networks into a valuable resource for information hungry applications will benefit from techniques being developed for the emerging Cloud Computing technologies. Traditional High Performance Computing approaches may be replaced or find a place in data manipulation prior to the data being moved into the Cloud. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to integrate the Cloud Computing model with WSN. Deployed WSN will be connected to the proposed infrastructure.

This kind of techniques can avoid wasting resources in providing perfect objective metric which may have little or even no effect on user experience. This paper presents a QoE-aware power allocation algorithm in multiuser Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The power allocation problem is formulated to maximize the overall QoE subject to the total transmit power constraint. The original model is solved by means of transformation and approximation, since it is difficult to develop a closed-form solution. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can enhance the performance in terms of both the overall QoE and single user QoE in comparison with the classical water-filling algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/MSN.2011.89","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/6117296/6117374/06117457.pdf","startPage":"418","endPage":"422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSN.2011.89","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoE-aware Power Allocation Algorithm in Multiuser OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117457/","displayDocTitle":"QoE-aware Power Allocation Algorithm in Multiuser OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12489813","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117457/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoE-aware Power Allocation Algorithm in Multiuser OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"4610a418.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064969S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6117296","isNumber":"6117374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6117296","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6117374","articleId":"6117457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6117466,"authors":[{"name":"Ryuzou Nishi","affiliation":["Panasonic System Networks Company Limited, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryuzou","lastName":"Nishi","id":"37317928800"},{"name":"Kirill Morozov","affiliation":["Institute of Mathematics for Industry, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kirill","lastName":"Morozov","id":"37703926100"},{"name":"Yoshiaki Hori","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshiaki","lastName":"Hori","id":"37288275400"},{"name":"Kouichi Sakurai","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Kouichi","lastName":"Sakurai","id":"37266233200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-2178-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4610-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6117466","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117466","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Receivers","Encoding","Channel capacity","Noise","Security","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","encoding","indoor communication","matched filters","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secrecy capacity","wireless LAN","matched filter","wire-tap channel coding","eve channel","coding scheme","IEEE 802.11 protocol specification","indoor wireless communication","additive white Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["secrecy capacity","wire-tap channel","information-theoretic security","matched filter","wireless communication"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117374","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"2011 Seventh International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/MSN.2011.40","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement on Secrecy Capacity of Wireless LAN Using Matched Filter","startPage":"463","endPage":"469","pdfPath":"/iel5/6117296/6117374/06117466.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSN.2011.40","abstract":"Wire-tap channel coding allows information-theoretically secure communication between legitimate sender and receiver in presence of an eavesdropper Eve, whose channel is subject to noise. A secrecy capacity for their communication is equal to capacity of the channel connecting them, minus capacity of Eve's channel, when the channels are assumed independent and affected by additive white Gaussian noise. In order to increase the secrecy capacity, we propose to employ a coding scheme using matched filter. The legitimate parties are assumed to share a pre-shared key of the matched filter, secretly from Eve. Hereby, the legitimate parties can use it to increase the capacity of their channel, while Eve cannot.

In this paper, we focus on the detection of landmarks under realistic scenarios that include pose, illumination and expression challenges as well as blur and low-resolution input. In our approach, an n-point shape of point-landmarks is represented as a union of simpler polygonal sub-shapes. The core idea of our method is to find the sequence of deformation parameters simultaneously for all sub-shapes that transform each point-landmark into its target landmark location. To accomplish this task, we introduce an agglomerate of fern regressors. To optimize the convergence speed and accuracy we take advantage of search localization using component-landmark detectors, multi-scale analysis and learning of point cloud dynamics. Results from extensive experiments on facial images from several challenging publicly available databases demonstrate that our method (ACFeR) can reliably detect landmarks with accuracy comparable to commercial soft ware and other state-of-the-art methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Facial landmark detection in uncontrolled conditions","publicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","doi":"10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117477","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105663/6117470/06117477.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117477","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Facial landmark detection in uncontrolled conditions","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117477/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12494324","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Facial landmark detection in uncontrolled conditions","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077665S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105663","isNumber":"6117470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105663","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6117470","articleId":"6117477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6117482,"authors":[{"name":"Soweon Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, USA"],"firstName":"Soweon","lastName":"Yoon","id":"38239488900"},{"name":"Jianjiang Feng","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianjiang","lastName":"Feng","id":"37399558100"},{"name":"Anil K.

The amount of information available for identification from latents is often limited due to their poor quality, unclear ridge structure and occlusion with complex back ground or even other latent prints. We propose a latent fingerprint enhancement algorithm, which expects manually marked region of interest (ROI) and singular points. The core of the proposed algorithm is a robust orientation field estimation algorithm for latents. Short-time Fourier transform is used to obtain multiple orientation elements in each image block. This is followed by a hypothesize-and test paradigm based on randomized RANSAC, which generates a set of hypothesized orientation fields. Experimental results on NIST SD27 latent fingerprint database show that the matching performance of a commercial matcher is significantly improved by utilizing the enhanced latent finger prints produced by the proposed algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117482/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117482/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12494329","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Latent fingerprint enhancement via robust orientation field estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Latent fingerprint enhancement via robust orientation field estimation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058619S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105663","isNumber":"6117470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105663","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6117470","articleId":"6117482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6117486,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunju Maeng","affiliation":["Department of Brain and Cognitive Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyunju Maeng","id":"38235282700"},{"name":"Hyun-Cheol Choi","affiliation":["Department of Brain and Cognitive Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyun-Cheol Choi","id":"37595960400"},{"name":"Unsang Park","affiliation":["Department of Compo Science & Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Unsang Park","id":"37400212000"},{"name":"Seong-Whan Lee","affiliation":["Department of Brain and Cognitive Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seong-Whan Lee","id":"37281134700"},{"name":"Anil K.

However, face recognition at a distance in nighttime has not yet received adequate attention considering the increased security threats at nighttime. We introduce a new face image database, called Near-Infrared Face Recognition at a Distance Database (NFRAD-DB). Images in NFRAD-DB are collected at a distance of up to 60 meters with 50 different subjects using a near-infrared cam- era, a telescope, and near-infrared illuminator. We provide face recognition performance using FaceVACS, DoG-SIFT, and DoG-MLBP representations. The face recognition test consisted of NIR images of these 50 subjects at 60 meters as probe and visible images at 1 meter with additional mug shot images of 10,000 subjects as gallery. Rank-1 identification accuracy of 28 percent was achieved from the pro- posed method compared to 18 percent rank-1 accuracy of a state of the art face recognition system, FaceVACS. These recognition results are encouraging given this challenging matching problem due to the illumination pattern and insufficient brightness in NFRAD images.","doi":"10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117486","publicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105663/6117470/06117486.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NFRAD: Near-Infrared Face Recognition at a Distance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117486/","displayDocTitle":"NFRAD: Near-Infrared Face Recognition at a Distance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12494333","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117486/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NFRAD: Near-Infrared Face Recognition at a Distance","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056505S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105663","isNumber":"6117470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105663","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6117470","articleId":"6117486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6117487,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The objective of ESRA'2011 is to evaluate through two different tasks the resistance of different online signature systems to skilled forgeries categorized automatically according to their quality. Task 1 aims at studying with only coordinate time functions the influence of acquisition conditions (digitizing tablet vs. PDA) on systems' performance. The two BioSecure Data Sets DS2 and DS3 make this possible, since they contain data from the same 382 people, acquired respectively on a digitizer and on a PDA. Task 2 then aims at assessing the contribution of the five time functions available on a digitizer (coordinates, pressure, pen inclination) on systems' resistance to different qualities of skilled forgeries. Results of the 13 systems involved in this competition are reported and analyzed for both tasks in this paper. We observe that the best system in terms of performance on forgeries of \"bad\" quality is not necessarily the most resistant to an increased quality of skilled forgeries. Also, we note that mobile conditions are still threatening independently of the quality of forgeries. Finally, when adding pen inclination time functions to pressure and coordinates, we find that the gap between systems in terms of performance is wider than when only pen coordinates and pressure are considered.","doi":"10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117487","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105663/6117470/06117487.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BioSecure Signature Evaluation Campaign (ESRA'2011): evaluating systems on quality-based categories of skilled forgeries","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"BioSecure Signature Evaluation Campaign (ESRA'2011): evaluating systems on quality-based categories of skilled forgeries","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117487/","accessionNumber":"12494334","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117487/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BioSecure Signature Evaluation Campaign (ESRA'2011): evaluating systems on quality-based categories of skilled forgeries","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089138S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105663","isNumber":"6117470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105663","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6117470","articleId":"6117487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6117491,"authors":[{"name":"Vipin Vijayan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Vipin","lastName":"Vijayan","id":"38232501000"},{"name":"Kevin W.

However, the 3D TEC dataset is a more challenging dataset which consists of 3D scans of 107 pairs of twins that were acquired in a single session, with each subject having a scan of a neutral expression and a smiling expression. The combination of factors related to the facial similarity of identical twins and the variation in facial expression makes this a challenging dataset. We conduct experiments using state of the art face recognition algorithms and present the results.

In this paper, we study the 3D face recognition from 3D face sketches which are derived from hand-drawn sketches and machine generated sketches. First, we have developed a 3D sketch modeling approach to create 3D facial sketch models from 2D facial sketch images. Second, we compared the 3D sketches to the existing 3D scans. Third, the 3D face similarity is measured between 3D sketches versus 3D scans, and 3D sketches versus 3D sketches based on the spatial Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classification. Experiments are conducted on both the BU-4DFE database and YSU face sketch database, resulting in a recognition rate at around 92% on average.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105663/6117470/06117501.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","doi":"10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D face sketch modeling and assessment for component based face recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Data models","Three dimensional displays","Manuals","Face recognition","Active appearance model","High definition video"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","hidden Markov models","image matching","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D face sketch modeling","3D face sketch assessment","face recognition","3D facial representations","geometric matching","3D range data","3D geometric meshes","geometric measurement","hand drawn sketches","2D facial sketch images","Hidden Markov Model","HMM","YSU face sketch database","BU-4DFE database"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"3D face sketch modeling and assessment for component based face recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117501/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12494348","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D face sketch modeling and assessment for component based face recognition","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"103.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081436S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105663","isNumber":"6117470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105663","xplore-issue":"6117470","articleId":"6117501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6117503,"authors":[{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Anjos","affiliation":["Centre du Parc, Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Anjos","id":"38241985600"},{"name":"S\u00e9bastien Marcel","affiliation":["Centre du Parc, Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland"],"firstName":"S\u00e9bastien","lastName":"Marcel","id":"37270970400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1359-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1358-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1357-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6117503","dbTime":"111 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":170,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":1159},"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE Biometrics Compendium","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/biocomp","packageName":"BIOCOMP"},{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"},{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","face recognition","image motion analysis","protocols","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photo attack","public database","by-pass 2D face recognition","spoofed identities","protocols","spoofing detector","PRINT-ATTACK database","motion-based algorithm","correlation detection","person head movement","printed photograph"]}],"abstract":"A common technique to by-pass 2-D face recognition systems is to use photographs of spoofed identities. Unfortunately, research in counter-measures to this type of attack have not kept-up even if such threats have been known for nearly a decade, there seems to exist no consensus on best practices, techniques or protocols for developing and testing spoofing-detectors for face recognition. We attribute the reason for this delay, partly, to the unavailability of public databases and protocols to study solutions and compare results. To this purpose we introduce the publicly available PRINT-ATTACK database and exemplify how to use its companion protocol with a motion-based algorithm that detects correlations between the person's head movements and the scene context. The results are to be used as basis for comparison to other counter-measure techniques. The PRINT-ATTACK database contains 200 videos of real- accesses and 200 videos of spoof attempts using printed photographs of 50 different identities.","doi":"10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117503","publicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105663/6117470/06117503.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117470","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Counter-measures to photo attacks in face recognition: A public database and a baseline","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Counter-measures to photo attacks in face recognition: A public database and a baseline","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117503/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12494350","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6117503/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Counter-measures to photo attacks in face recognition: A public database and a baseline","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078884S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105663","isNumber":"6117470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105663","citationCount":"170","xplore-issue":"6117470","articleId":"6117503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6117509,"authors":[{"name":"Murali Mohan Chakka","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Switzerland","Idiap Research Institute"],"firstName":"Murali Mohan","lastName":"Chakka","id":"38361163200"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Anjos","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Switzerland","Idiap Research Institute"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Anjos","id":"38241985600"},{"name":"S\u00e9bastien Marcel","affiliation":["Idiap Research Institute, Switzerland"],"firstName":"S\u00e9bastien","lastName":"Marcel","id":"37270970400"},{"name":"Roberto Tronci","affiliation":["Ambient Intelligence Laboratory, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Tronci","id":"38356007200"},{"name":"Daniele Muntoni","affiliation":["Ambient Intelligence Laboratory, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Muntoni","id":"38233105800"},{"name":"Gianluca Fadda","affiliation":["Ambient Intelligence Laboratory, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Fadda","id":"38233106100"},{"name":"Maurizio Pili","affiliation":["Ambient Intelligence Laboratory, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Pili","id":"38233105600"},{"name":"Nicola Sirena","affiliation":["Ambient Intelligence Laboratory, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Sirena","id":"37540510800"},{"name":"Gabriele Murgia","affiliation":["Ambient Intelligence Laboratory, Italy"],"firstName":"Gabriele","lastName":"Murgia","id":"38233111300"},{"name":"Marco Ristori","affiliation":["Ambient Intelligence Laboratory, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Ristori","id":"38233110900"},{"name":"Fabio Roli","affiliation":["Ambient Intelligence Laboratory, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Roli","id":"37269799800"},{"name":"Junjie Yan","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"lastName":"Junjie Yan","id":"37087496657"},{"name":"Dong Yi","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"lastName":"Dong Yi","id":"37087391581"},{"name":"Zhen Lei","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"lastName":"Zhen Lei","id":"37087333797"},{"name":"Zhiwei Zhang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"lastName":"Zhiwei Zhang","id":"37087178597"},{"name":"Stan Z.

A spoofing attack occurs when a person tries to masquerade as someone else by falsifying data and thereby gaining illegitimate access. Inspired by image quality assessment, characterization of printing artifacts, and differences in light reflection, we propose to approach the problem of spoofing detection from texture analysis point of view. Indeed, face prints usually contain printing quality defects that can be well detected using texture features. Hence, we present a novel approach based on analyzing facial image textures for detecting whether there is a live person in front of the camera or a face print. The proposed approach analyzes the texture of the facial images using multi-scale local binary patterns (LBP). Compared to many previous works, our proposed approach is robust, computationally fast and does not require user-cooperation. In addition, the texture features that are used for spoofing detection can also be used for face recognition. This provides a unique feature space for coupling spoofing detection and face recognition. Extensive experimental analysis on a publicly avail able database showed excellent results compared to existing works.","doi":"10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117510","publicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105663/6117470/06117510.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117470","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face spoofing detection from single images using micro-texture analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face spoofing detection from single images using micro-texture analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117510/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12494356","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6117510/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face spoofing detection from single images using micro-texture analysis","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067919S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105663","isNumber":"6117470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105663","citationCount":"190","xplore-issue":"6117470","articleId":"6117510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6117522,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Tronci","affiliation":["Sardegna Ricerche, Ambient Intelligence Lab., Pula, CA, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Tronci","id":"38356007200"},{"name":"Daniele Muntoni","affiliation":["Sardegna Ricerche, Ambient Intelligence Lab., Pula, CA, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Muntoni","id":"38233105800"},{"name":"Gianluca Fadda","affiliation":["Sardegna Ricerche, Ambient Intelligence Lab., Pula, CA, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Fadda","id":"38233106100"},{"name":"Maurizio Pili","affiliation":["Sardegna Ricerche, Ambient Intelligence Lab., Pula, CA, Italy"],"firstName":"Maurizio","lastName":"Pili","id":"38233105600"},{"name":"Nicola Sirena","affiliation":["Sardegna Ricerche, Ambient Intelligence Lab., Pula, CA, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Sirena","id":"37540510800"},{"name":"Gabriele Murgia","affiliation":["Sardegna Ricerche, Ambient Intelligence Lab., Pula, CA, Italy"],"firstName":"Gabriele","lastName":"Murgia","id":"38233111300"},{"name":"Marco Ristori","affiliation":["Sardegna Ricerche, Ambient Intelligence Lab., Pula, CA, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Ristori","id":"38233110900"},{"name":"Sardegna Ricerche","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Cagliari, Cagliari, Sardegna, IT"],"firstName":"Sardegna","lastName":"Ricerche","id":"37087643509"},{"name":"Fabio Roli","affiliation":["Deparment of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Univ. of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Roli","id":"37269799800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1359-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1358-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1357-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6117522","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":21,"totalDownloads":471},"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE Biometrics Compendium","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/biocomp","packageName":"BIOCOMP"},{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"},{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiation detectors","Face recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","face recognition","image classification","image fusion","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple clue fusion","photo attack detection","face recognition systems","2D face spoofing attacks","face movements","authentication session","video analysis","static analysis","robust classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117522","abstract":"We faced the problem of detecting 2-D face spoofing attacks performed by placing a printed photo of a real user in front of the camera.

Previous work on gait-based age estimation evaluated their methods using databases that included only 170 subjects at most with a limited age variation, which was insufficient to statistically demonstrate the possibility of gait-based age estimation. Therefore, we first constructed a much larger whole generation gait database which includes 1,728 subjects with ages ranging from 2 to 94 years. We then provided a base line algorithm for gait-based age estimation implemented by Gaussian process regression, which has achieved successes in the face-based age estimation field, in conjunction with silhouette-based gait features such as an averaged silhouette (or Gait Energy Image) which has been used extensively in many gait recognition algorithms. Finally, experiments using the whole-generation gait database demonstrated the viability of gait-based age estimation.","doi":"10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117531","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105663/6117470/06117531.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gait-based age estimation using a whole-generation gait database","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Surveillance","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","gait analysis","Gaussian processes","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gait based age estimation","whole generation gait database","baseline algorithm","Gaussian process regression","face based age estimation field","silhouette based gait features","gait recognition algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Gait-based age estimation using a whole-generation gait database","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117531/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12494377","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gait-based age estimation using a whole-generation gait database","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119483S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105663","isNumber":"6117470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105663","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6117470","articleId":"6117531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":6117538,"authors":[{"name":"Ngoc-Son Vu","affiliation":["Gipsa-lab, Grenoble Institute of Technology, France"],"firstName":"Ngoc-Son","lastName":"Vu","id":"37391309700"},{"name":"Alice Caplier","affiliation":["Gipsa-lab, Grenoble Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Alice","lastName":"Caplier","id":"37266382200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1359-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1358-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1357-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6117538","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE Biometrics Compendium","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/biocomp","packageName":"BIOCOMP"},{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"},{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","edge detection","face recognition","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern mining","face recognition","face representation","patterns of oriented edge magnitudes","POEM","edge distributions","image patches","patterns of dominant orientations","PDO","image regions","PCA technique"]}],"abstract":"Good face recognition system is one which quickly de- livers high accurate results to the end user. For this purpose, face representation must be robust, discriminative and also of low computational cost in both terms of time and space. Inspired by recently proposed feature set so-called POEM (Patterns of Oriented Edge Magnitudes) which considers the relationships between edge distributions of different image patches and is argued balancing well the three concerns, this work proposes to further exploit patterns of both orientations and magnitudes for building more efficient algorithm. We first present novel features called Patterns of Dominant Orientations (PDO) which consider the relationships between \"dominant\" orientations of local image regions at different scales. We also propose to apply the whitened PCA technique upon both the POEM and PDO based representations to get more compact and discriminative face descriptors. We then show that the two methods have complementary strength and that by combining the two descriptors, one obtains stronger results than either of them considered separately. By experiments carried out on several common benchmarks, including both frontal and non- frontal FERET as well as the AR datasets, we prove that our approach is more efficient than contemporary ones.","doi":"10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117538","publicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105663/6117470/06117538.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117470","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mining patterns of orientations and magnitudes for face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mining patterns of orientations and magnitudes for face recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117538/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12494384","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6117538/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mining patterns of orientations and magnitudes for face recognition","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084179S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105663","isNumber":"6117470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105663","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6117470","articleId":"6117538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6117547,"authors":[{"name":"Brendan Klare","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Brendan","lastName":"Klare","id":"37595938300"},{"name":"Anil K.

While some success has been made on this front, a fundamental questions has yet to be answered: do face recognition systems that compensate for the effects of aging compromise recognition performance for faces that have not undergone any aging? The studies in this paper help confirm that age invariant systems do seem to decrease performance in non-aging scenarios. This is demonstrated by performing training experiments on the largest face aging dataset studied in the literature to date (over 200,000 images from roughly 64,000 subjects). Further experiments conducted in this research help demonstrate the impact of aging on two leading commercial face recognition systems. We also determine the regions of the face that remain the most stable over time.","doi":"10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117547","publicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105663/6117470/06117547.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117547","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117470","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition across time lapse: On learning feature subspaces","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117547","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition across time lapse: On learning feature subspaces","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117547/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12494393","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6117547/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition across time lapse: On learning feature subspaces","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"262.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083296S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105663","isNumber":"6117470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105663","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6117470","articleId":"6117547","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6117555,"authors":[{"name":"Huibin Li","affiliation":["CNRS, Universite de Lyon, Lyon, France","Ecole Centrale de Lyon, URIS UMR5205, Lyon, France"],"lastName":"Huibin Li","id":"38528470300"},{"name":"Di Huang","affiliation":["CNRS, Universite de Lyon, Lyon, France","Ecole Centrale de Lyon, URIS UMR5205, Lyon, France"],"lastName":"Di Huang","id":"37401456900"},{"name":"Jean-Marie Morvan","affiliation":["CNRS, Universite de Lyon, France","Institut Camille Jordan, Universite Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France","GMSV Research Center, King Abdullah University for Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Jean-Marie","lastName":"Morvan","id":"38242553100"},{"name":"Liming Chen","affiliation":["CNRS, Universite de Lyon, Lyon, France","Ecole Centrale de Lyon, URIS UMR5205, Lyon, France"],"firstName":"Liming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292793900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1359-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1358-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1357-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6117555","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"virtualJournals":[{"title":"IEEE Biometrics Compendium","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/biocomp","packageName":"BIOCOMP"},{"title":"IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfic","packageName":"RFIC"},{"title":"IEEE RFID Virtual Journal","homePageLink":"/virtual-journals/rfid","packageName":"RFID"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three dimensional displays","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning weighted sparse representation","encoded facial normal information","expression robust 3D face recognition","3D facial surface","normal vector","pattern histograms","FRGC v2.0 database","Bosphorus datasets"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a novel approach for 3D face recognition by learning weighted sparse representation of encoded facial normal information. To comprehensively describe 3D facial surface, three components, in X, Y, and Z-plane respectively, of normal vector are encoded locally to their corresponding normal pattern histograms.

Experimental results achieved on the FRGC v2.0 database prove that the proposed encoded normal information is much more discriminative than original normal information. Moreover, the patch based weights learned using the FRGC v1.0 and Bosphorus datasets also demonstrate the importance of each facial physical component for 3D face recognition.","doi":"10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117555","publicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105663/6117470/06117555.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117470","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning weighted sparse representation of encoded facial normal information for expression-robust 3D face recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Learning weighted sparse representation of encoded facial normal information for expression-robust 3D face recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117555/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12494401","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6117555/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning weighted sparse representation of encoded facial normal information for expression-robust 3D face recognition","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100349S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105663","isNumber":"6117470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105663","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6117470","articleId":"6117555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6117572,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Zhao","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37066642000"},{"name":"Huajun Fang","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huajun","lastName":"Fang","id":"37085666040"},{"name":"Jun Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37440199400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1997-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1998-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1996-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6117572","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1676},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recycling","Transconductance","Transistors","Gain","Mirrors","Power demand","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power constant-Gm rail-to-rail operational transconductance amplifier","recycling current","CMOS process","SMIC standard","voltage 23.4 V","bandwidth 168.1 MHz","size 65 nm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117572","abstract":"A modification to the conventional constant-g\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sub>\n rail-to-rail operational transconductance amplifier is presented.

However, few studies have addressed the question of how to recognize an arbitrary image patch of a holistic face. In this paper we ad- dress this problem of partial face recognition. Partial faces frequently appear in unconstrained image capture environments, particularly when faces are captured by surveillance cameras or handheld devices (e.g. mobile phones). The pro- posed approach adopts a variable-size description which represents each face with a set of keypoint descriptors. In this way, we argue that a probe face image, holistic or partial, can be sparsely represented by a large dictionary of gallery descriptors. The proposed method is alignment free and we address large-scale face recognition problems by a fast filtering strategy. Experimental results on three public domain face databases (FRGCv2.0, AR, and LFW) show that the proposed method achieves promising results in recognizing both holistic and partial faces.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial face recognition: An alignment free approach","publicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","doi":"10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117573","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105663/6117470/06117573.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Partial face recognition: An alignment free approach","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117573/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12494402","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial face recognition: An alignment free approach","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086339S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105663","isNumber":"6117470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105663","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6117470","articleId":"6117573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6117575,"authors":[{"name":"Yiqi.

Second, we demonstrate the possibility of SWIR cross-spectral matching under controlled and challenging scenarios. Third, we illustrate how photometric normalization and our proposed cross-photometric score level fusion rule can be utilized to improve cross-spectral matching performance across all scenarios. We utilized both commercial and academic (texture-based) face matchers and performed a set of experiments indicating that SWIR images can be matched to visible images with encouraging results.

The performance of traditional recognition algorithms will drop drastically due to the loss of facial texture information in original high resolution (HR) images. To address this problem, in this paper we propose an effective approach named Simultaneous Discriminant Analysis (SDA). SDA learns two map- pings from LR and HR images respectively to a common subspace where discrimination property is maximized. In SDA, (1) the data gap between LR and HR is reduced by mapping into a common space; and (2) the mapping is de- signed for preserving most discriminative information. After that, the conventional classification method is applied in the common space for final decision. Extensive experiments are conducted on both FERET and Multi-PIE, and the results clearly show the superiority of the proposed SDA over state-of-the-art methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-resolution face recognition via Simultaneous Discriminant Analysis","publicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","doi":"10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117595","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6105663/6117470/06117595.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCB.2011.6117595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117470","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117595","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Low-resolution face recognition via Simultaneous Discriminant Analysis","conferenceDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117595/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12494414","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-resolution face recognition via Simultaneous Discriminant Analysis","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058963S","chronDate":"11-13 Oct. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6105663","isNumber":"6117470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6105663","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6117470","articleId":"6117595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6117600,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Juefei-Xu","affiliation":["CyLab Biometrics Center, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Felix","lastName":"Juefei-Xu","id":"38363888200"},{"name":"Khoa Luu","affiliation":["CyLab Biometrics Center, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","CENPARMI, Concordia University, Montreal, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada"],"lastName":"Khoa Luu","id":"37087067456"},{"name":"Marios Savvides","affiliation":["CyLab Biometrics Center, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA"],"firstName":"Marios","lastName":"Savvides","id":"37272021900"},{"name":"Tien D.

We find the WLBP feature on periocular region maintains consistency of the same individual across ages. Finally, we use unsupervised discriminant projection (UDP) to build subspaces on WLBP featured periocular images and gain 100% rank-1 identification rate and 98% verification rate at 0.1% false accept rate on the entire FG-NET database.

The setting of the frequency accuracy of lock detector is a tough task as large ppm will leads to a longer lock time for phase tracking loop and small ppm will leads to more switching time between the loops. A novel lock detector with hysteresis property is proposed in this paper. It provides two different ppms in both different conditions; a smaller ppm for in-lock condition and a larger ppm for out-of-lock condition. This paper also provides a detailed analysis of the proposed lock detector at different conditions.

And a model of Time-Delay-Integration (TDI) CMOS image sensor is presented, which is used to analyze the noise performance. In this model, input signals are accumulated 4 times by the type of current and then converted to digital signals to accomplish the other accumulation by 32 times, i.e., 4\u00d732 accumulation mode. The noise, which includes switch charge injection, sample noise and KT/C noise, is considered in this model. The major source of the noise and the relationship between noise and sample capacitance are evaluated through the model simulation. The results indicate that the total noise can be restrained by increasing sample capacitance. When the input signal is arranging from 0\u03bcA to 100\u03bcA, the accuracy of the current accumulator can be 11bits by using 1pF sample capacitor. And the SNR of the output signal can be increased by 20.38dB which is close to the ideal result.","doi":"10.1109/EDSSC.2011.6117724","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference of Electron Devices and Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference of Electron Devices and Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/6108454/6117556/06117724.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDSSC.2011.6117724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of noise of current accumulator in Time-Delay-Integration CMOS image sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-18 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117724/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of noise of current accumulator in Time-Delay-Integration CMOS image sensor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12461478","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117724/","conferenceDate":"17-18 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of noise of current accumulator in Time-Delay-Integration CMOS image sensor","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"T76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042992S","chronDate":"17-18 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6108454","isNumber":"6117556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6108454","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6117556","articleId":"6117724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6117730,"authors":[{"name":"Gao Zhiyuan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Zhiyuan","id":"37531742500"},{"name":"Yao Suying","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Suying","id":"37298371600"},{"name":"Xu Jiangtao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Jiangtao","id":"37541601300"},{"name":"Li Binqiao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Binqiao","id":"37541298300"},{"name":"Gao Cen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information and Engineering, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Gao","lastName":"Cen","id":"38235914500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1997-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1998-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1996-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6117730","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":501},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Charge transfer","CMOS image sensors","Electric potential","Doping","Photodiodes","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","photodiodes","transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lag free transfer transistor structure","CMOS image sensor pixel","charge transfer","image lag elimination","photodiode","nonuniform doped poly-silicon gate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["charge transfer","CMOS Image sensor","Image lag","non-uniform doped gate","transfer gate"]}],"abstract":"A transfer transistor structure achieving complete charge transfer in a CMOS image sensor pixel is proposed to eliminate image lag.

In this paper, we focus on defending against the jamming attack, one of the major threats to cognitive radio networks. Secondary users can exploit the flexible access to multiple channels as the means of anti-jamming defense. We first investigate the situation where a secondary user can access only one channel at a time and hop among different channels, and model it as an anti-jamming game. Analyzing the interaction between the secondary user and attackers, we derive a channel hopping defense strategy using the Markov decision process approach with the assumption of perfect knowledge, and then propose two learning schemes for secondary users to gain knowledge of adversaries to handle cases without perfect knowledge. In addition, we extend to the scenario where secondary users can access all available channels simultaneously, and redefine the anti-jamming game with randomized power allocation as the defense strategy. We derive the Nash equilibrium for this Colonel Blotto game which minimizes the worst-case damage. Finally, simulation results are presented to verify the performance.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.120102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6117754/06117758.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.120102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anti-Jamming Games in Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117758","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117758/","displayDocTitle":"Anti-Jamming Games in Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"30","issue":"1","publicationDate":"January 2012","accessionNumber":"12427119","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117758/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anti-Jamming Games in Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"004jsac0112wu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145118S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6117754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"6117754","articleId":"6117758","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6117759,"authors":[{"name":"Qian Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6117754/6117759/6117759-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qian Wang received the B.S. degree from Wuhan University, China, in 2003 and the M.S. degree from Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, in 2006, both in Electrical Engineering.

Existing researches, however, are almost all based on ad hoc designs of frequency hopping strategies, mainly due to lack of theoretical foundations for scheme performance evaluation. To fill this gap, in this paper we introduce the online optimization theory into our solution and, for the first time, make the thorough quantitative performance characterization possible for UFH-based anti-jamming communications. Specifically, we formulate the UFH-based anti-jamming communication as a non-stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and propose an online learning-based UFH algorithm achieving asymptotic optimum. To reduce the time and space complexity, we further develop an enhanced algorithm exploiting the internal structure of strategy selection process. We analytically prove the optimality of the proposed algorithms under various message coding scenarios. An extensive simulation study is conducted to validate our theoretical analysis and show that the learning-based UFH algorithms are resilient against both oblivious and adaptive jamming attacks.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.120103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117754","startPage":"16","endPage":"30","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6117754/06117759.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.120103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Optimal Adaptive UFH-Based Anti-Jamming Wireless Communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Receivers","Encoding","Algorithm design and analysis","Spread spectrum communication","Protocols","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","encoding","jamming","optimisation","performance evaluation","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal adaptive UFH-based anti-jamming wireless communication","preshared secret","uncoordinated frequency hopping","ad hoc design","online optimization theory","quantitative performance characterization","nonstochastic multiarmed bandit problem","online learning-based UFH algorithm","strategy selection process","message coding scenario"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anti-jamming","uncoordinated frequency hopping","multi-armed bandit problem","wireless communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","displayDocTitle":"Towards Optimal Adaptive UFH-Based Anti-Jamming Wireless Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117759/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6117759/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12437969","publicationDate":"January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Optimal Adaptive UFH-Based Anti-Jamming Wireless Communication","sourcePdf":"016jsac0112wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086549S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6117754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6117754","articleId":"6117759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6117762,"authors":[{"name":"Pan Zhou","affiliation":["Communications Systems Center (CSC) Lab, School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6117754/6117762/6117762-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pan Zhou obtained his Ph.D. in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2011 as a member of the Communications Systems Center (CSC).

In most existing works, however, CR users are required to share the interference channel information and power strategies to conduct the game with pricing mechanisms that incur the frequent exchange of information. The requirement of significant communication overheads among CR users impedes fully distributed solutions for the deployment of CR networks, which is a challenging problem in the research communities. In this paper, a robust distributed power control algorithm is designed with low implementation complexity for CR networks through reinforcement learning, which does not require the interference channel and power strategy information among CR users (and from CR users to PUs). To the best of our knowledge, this research provides the solution for the first time for the incomplete-information power control game in CR networks. During the repeated game, CR users can control their power strategies by observing the interference from the feedback signals of PUs and transmission rates obtained in the previous step. This procedure allows achieving high spectrum efficiency while conforming to the interference constraint of PUs. This constrained repeated stochastic game with learning automaton is proved to be asymptotically equivalence to the traditional game with complete information. The properties of existence, diagonal concavity and uniqueness for the game are studied. A Bush-Mosteller reinforcement learning procedure is designed for the power control algorithm, and the properties of convergence and learning rate of the algorithm are analyzed. The performance of the learning-based power control algorithm is thoroughly investigated with simulation results, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving variety of practical CR network problems for real-world applications.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.120106","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6117754/06117762.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117754","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.120106","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"54","endPage":"69","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reinforcement Learning for Repeated Power Control Game in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Reinforcement Learning for Repeated Power Control Game in Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117762/","volume":"30","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6117762/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2012","accessionNumber":"12437971","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reinforcement Learning for Repeated Power Control Game in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"054jsac0112Zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082455S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6117754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6117754","articleId":"6117762","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6117763,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Ni","affiliation":["School of Engineering & Design, Brunei University, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6117754/6117763/6117763-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qiang Ni received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan City, China.

On the other hand, if the channels fluctuate stochastically over time, the associated game still admits a unique equilibrium, but the learning process is not deterministic; just the same, by employing the theory of stochastic approximation, we find that users still converge to equilibrium.

To capture the tradeoff between obtaining good synchronization performance and saving as much energy as possible, we propose a noncooperative game in which each transmitter-receiver pair seeks to maximize the ratio of the probability of code alignment detection to the transmitted energy per acquisition, under a constraint on the maximum probability of spurious code locks - this is achieved by properly setting the receiver threshold and the transmit power. Our framework also considers the coexistence between different types of synchronizers and different QoS requirements. The generalized Nash solution of the game is investigated and closed-form expressions are derived and compared with simulation results for an iterative decentralized algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6117754/06117766.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.120110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.120110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117754","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game-Theoretic Perspective on Code Synchronization for CDMA Wireless Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Games","Multiaccess communication","Wireless communication","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel coding","code division multiple access","game theory","iterative methods","probability","quality of service","radio receivers","radio transmitters","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","code synchronization","CDMA","resource allocation","wireless communication network","noncooperative game","transmitter","probability","code alignment detection","QoS","Nash solution","iterative decentralized algorithm","code acquisition","receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Game theory","generalized Nash equilibrium","resource allocation","power control","multiuser wireless networks","CDMA","code synchronization","code acquisition","energy efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Game-Theoretic Perspective on Code Synchronization for CDMA Wireless Systems","volume":"30","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6117766/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2012","accessionNumber":"12437972","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Game-Theoretic Perspective on Code Synchronization for CDMA Wireless Systems","sourcePdf":"107jsac0112bacci.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083495S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6117754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6117754","articleId":"6117766","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6117767,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro B.

In order to improve the performance of WMNs, extensive research efforts have been dedicated towards finding means to increase the number of simultaneous transmissions in the network while avoiding signal interference among radios. In case of WMNs based on IEEE 802.11 b/g standards, most recent research works have relied upon the usage of orthogonal channels for solving the Channel Assignment (CA) problem. In this paper, we explore the possibility of exploiting Partially Overlapped Channels (POCs) by introducing a novel game theoretic distributed CA algorithm. Our proposed algorithm outperforms both the conventional orthogonal channel approach and the recent heuristic CA algorithms using POC. The proposed algorithm is shown to achieve near-optimal performance in the average case.

This gives rise to price competition among the primaries, wherein each primary tries to attract secondaries by setting a lower price for its bandwidth than the other primaries. Radio spectrum has the distinctive feature that transmissions at neighboring locations on the same channel interfere with each other, whereas the same channel can be used at far-off locations without mutual interference. So in the above price competition scenario in a CRN, each primary must jointly select a set of mutually non-interfering locations within the region (which corresponds to an independent set in the conflict graph representing the region) at which to offer bandwidth and the price at each location. In this paper, we analyze this price competition scenario as a game and seek a Nash Equilibrium (NE). We identify a class of conflict graphs, which we refer to as mean valid graphs, such that the conflict graphs of a large number of topologies that commonly arise in practice are mean valid. We explicitly compute a symmetric NE in mean valid graphs and show that it is unique.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117770/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2011","volume":"30","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"12437976","publicationDate":"January 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117770/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Pricing Games with Spatial Reuse in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Pricing Games with Spatial Reuse in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"153jsac0112kasbekar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105677S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6117754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6117754","articleId":"6117770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6117771,"authors":[{"name":"Jaeok Park","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA","School of Economics, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaeok","lastName":"Park","id":"37407054900"},{"name":"Mihaela van der Schaar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mihaela","lastName":"van der Schaar","id":"37285114700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0733-8716"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0008"}],"articleNumber":"6117771","dbTime":"34 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":837},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Monitoring","Performance evaluation","Resource management","Wireless communication","Probability distribution","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","radio networks","radiotelemetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource sharing","wireless communications","intervention equilibrium","intervention game theory","noncooperative equilibrium","accurate monitoring technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Game theory","incentives","intervention","resource sharing","wireless communications"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Theory of Intervention Games for Resource Sharing in Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2012.120115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6117754","endPage":"175","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/49/6117754/06117771.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2012.120115","startPage":"165","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6117771","abstract":"This paper develops a game-theoretic framework for the design and analysis of a new class of incentive schemes called intervention schemes.

In the case of imperfect monitoring, intervention schemes can improve the suboptimal performance of non-cooperative equilibrium when the intervention device has a sufficiently accurate monitoring technology, although it may not be possible to achieve the best feasible performance. In the case of perfect monitoring, the best feasible performance can be obtained with an intervention scheme when the intervention device has a sufficiently strong intervention capability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"January 2012","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12437977","htmlLink":"/document/6117771/","displayDocTitle":"The Theory of Intervention Games for Resource Sharing in Wireless Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Theory of Intervention Games for Resource Sharing in Wireless Communications","sourcePdf":"165jsac0112park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069724S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6117754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6117754","articleId":"6117771","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6117773,"authors":[{"name":"Lingyang Song","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems & Networks, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6117754/6117773/6117773-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lingyang Song (S'03-M'06) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Jilin University, China in 2002 and a PhD in differential space time codes and MIMO from the University of York, UK, in 2007, where he received the K.

However, the existing work typically researched the CSI feedback problem for each individual mobile station (MS), and thus, cannot efficiently model the interactions among self-interested mobile users in the network level. To this end, in this paper, we propose an alternative approach to investigate the CSI feedback-rate control problem in the analytical setting of a game theoretic framework, in which a multiple-antenna base station (BS) communicates with a number of co-channel MSs through linear precoder. Specifically, we first present a non-cooperative feedback-rate control game (NFC), in which each MS selects the feedback-rate to maximize its performance in a distributed way. To improve efficiency from a social optimum point of view, we then introduce pricing, called the non-cooperative feedback-rate control game with price (NFCP). The game utility is defined as the performance gain by CSI feedback minus the price as a linear function of the CSI feedback-rate. The existence of the Nash equilibrium of such games is investigated, and two types of feedback protocols (FDMA and CSMA) are studied. Simulation results show that by adjusting the pricing factor, the distributed NFCP game results in close optimal performance compared with that of the centralized scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6117773/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"January  2012","publicationDate":"January 2012","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6117773/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","accessionNumber":"12437979","volume":"30","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Non-Cooperative Feedback-Rate Control Game for Channel State Information in Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Cooperative Feedback-Rate Control Game for Channel State Information in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"188jsac0112song.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069084S","chronDate":"January  2012","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6117754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6117754","articleId":"6117773","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6117774,"authors":[{"name":"Manzoor Ahmed Khan","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6117754/6117774/6117774-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Manzoor Ahmed Khan received the Bachelors of Engineering degree in Electronic Engineering from the Mehran University of Engineering and Technology (MUET), Pakistan, in 2001, the MS in computer science degree from Balochistan University of Engineering, Information Technology and Management Sciences, Pakistan, in 2005.

However, since data pre-processing including feature selection or dimensionality reduction and data reduction is a very important stage for successful data mining, very few consider performing both tasks to examine the impact of data pre-processing on prediction performance. This paper applies genetic algorithms, which have been widely used for the data pre-processing tasks, for feature selection and data reduction over a public bankruptcy prediction dataset. In particular, the experiments based on different priorities of performing feature selection and data reduction are conducted. The results show that performing data reduction only can allow the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to provide the highest rate of prediction accuracy. However, executing both feature selection and data reduction with different priorities performs the same. They not only largely reduce the dataset size, but also keep the similar performance as SVM without data pre-processing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118222/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6118222/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12490180","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Data pre-processing by genetic algorithms for bankruptcy prediction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data pre-processing by genetic algorithms for bankruptcy prediction","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"356289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064511S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6103492","isNumber":"6117862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6103492","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6117862","articleId":"6118222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6118235,"authors":[{"name":"R.

MAJSP is an extension of classical JSP. It represents more realistic scheduling problems since it includes more constraints of jobs. The objectives for part 1 are first to investigate whether the provided resources are appropriate for one month schedule and second to maximise the profit for a MAJSP by different methods of resource allocations. In the second part, the effect of genetic operators on the optimal solution obtained by the previous part will be discussed. In a MAJSP, more attributes introduce more types of resources. The resources are in terms of labour, material, and capital which can be restricted to be equally or non-equally allocated to the machines. Here, two algorithms were developed based on these assumptions and it was found the latter approach yields better results in terms of optimality and convergence speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118235/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12490193","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6118235/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","conferenceDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm approach for modelling and optimisation of MAJSP- Part I: Modelling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm approach for modelling and optimisation of MAJSP- Part I: Modelling","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"369465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059118S","chronDate":"6-9 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6103492","isNumber":"6117862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6103492","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6117862","articleId":"6118235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6118248,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanjun Laili","affiliation":["School of Automation Scicence and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuanjun","lastName":"Laili","id":"38109293200"},{"name":"Lin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation Scicence and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538576700"},{"name":"Fei Tao","affiliation":["School of Automation Scicence and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Tao","id":"37302743800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0739-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0740-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0738-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-362X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-3611"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"2157-3611"}],"articleNumber":"6118248","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":458},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6118248","abstract":"A new manufacturing paradigm, i.e. Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) has been proposed recently.

However, a large amount of feedback in the feedback for an integer or binary precoding matrix has been a bottleneck in its implementation. In this paper, we propose a codebook-based LRP scheme for limited-feedback coded MIMO systems. The proposed LRP scheme follows the fundamentals of the previous LRP scheme that employed multilevel binary coset coding so that the precoding matrix is binary. In the proposed LRP scheme, the conventional precoding matrix obtained from the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz algorithm is modified to specific forms that are predefined in a codebook set. The new precoding matrix is selected such that the lower bound on the capacity is maximized for a given codebook set, while the codebook set is designed offline such that the upper bound of the average capacity loss induced by the limitation on the codebook size is minimized. The simulation results show that the proposed LRP scheme nearly achieves the achievable rate of the conventional LRP scheme with a greatly reduced amount of feedback.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2011.122111.100489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/6148120/06118254.pdf","startPage":"510","endPage":"524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2011.122111.100489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6148120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Codebook-Based Lattice-Reduction-Aided Precoding for Limited-Feedback Coded MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6118254","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118254/","displayDocTitle":"Codebook-Based Lattice-Reduction-Aided Precoding for Limited-Feedback Coded MIMO Systems","volume":"60","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2012","accessionNumber":"12525154","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6118254/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Codebook-Based Lattice-Reduction-Aided Precoding for Limited-Feedback Coded MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"510-tc1202-yang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113173S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6148120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6148120","articleId":"6118254","onlineDate":"29 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6118255,"authors":[{"name":"Steven W.

In this paper, we combine the BD technique with a minimum mean square error vector precoding (MMSE-VP) for achieving further gain in performance with minimal computational overhead. Two key ingredients to make our approach effective are the QR decomposition based block diagonalization and joint optimization of transmitter and receiver parameters in the MMSE sense. In fact, by optimizing precoded signal vector and perturbation vector in the transmitter and receiver jointly, we pursue an optimal balance between the residual interference mitigation and the noise enhancement suppression. From the sum rate analysis as well as the bit error rate simulations (both uncoded and coded cases) in realistic multiuser MIMO downlink, we show that the proposed BD-MVP brings substantial performance gain over existing multiuser MIMO algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12525156","htmlLink":"/document/6118256/","displayDocTitle":"A MMSE Vector Precoding with Block Diagonalization for Multiuser MIMO Downlink","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A MMSE Vector Precoding with Block Diagonalization for Multiuser MIMO Downlink","sourcePdf":"569-tc1202-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061682S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6148120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6148120","articleId":"6118256","onlineDate":"29 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6118257,"authors":[{"name":"Chuzhe Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6148120/6118257/6118257-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chuzhe Xiao (S'll) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering in 2009 from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.

This setup efficiently achieves diversity gain. However, the high switching rate of such systems may be undesirable due to practical implementation issues, for example, the corruption of the data signal by receiver switching transients, channel estimation and synchronization failures due to excessive switching as well as network control switching overheads which increase with increased switching. Recently, switch-and-examine relaying whose main advantage is its low switching rate, was proposed as a low complexity suboptimal alternative to opportunistic relaying. Meanwhile, comparisons of the switching rates of opportunistic and switch-and-examine schemes have been undertaken only for the case of Rayleigh fading. The switching rates of opportunistic relaying and switch-and-examine relaying systems with two or more relays operating under Rician and Nakagami-m fading are obtained in closed-form or single integral expressions. Results for independent and identically distributed fading links are obtained for the case of multiple relays and additionally for independent but not identically distributed fading links for the two relays case. The closed-form solutions explicitly depend on the Doppler frequency of the fading.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118257/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2011","volume":"60","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"12525157","publicationDate":"February 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6118257/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Node Switching Rates of Opportunistic Relaying and Switch-and-Examine Relaying in Rician and Nakagami-m Fading","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Node Switching Rates of Opportunistic Relaying and Switch-and-Examine Relaying in Rician and Nakagami-m Fading","sourcePdf":"488-tc1202-xiao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102672S","chronDate":"February  2012","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6148120","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6148120","articleId":"6118257","onlineDate":"29 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6118258,"authors":[{"name":"Osama Amin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Osama","lastName":"Amin","id":"38185372300"},{"name":"Murat Uysal","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, \u00d6 zye\u011fin University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Uysal","id":"37278726600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"6118258","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":918},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Strontium","OFDM","Bit error rate","Loading","Signal to noise ratio","Error probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive power loading","multirelay OFDM regenerative networks","relay selection","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","bit error rate","Monte Carlo simulation","imperfect channel estimation","relay location"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","cooperative diversity","power allocation","detect-and-forward relaying","relay selection"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an adaptive power loading algorithm for an OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing)-based multi-relay regenerative network with relay selection.

The increase of process variations with continued CMOS technology scaling is considered one of the major challenges for SRAM designers. This process variations increase causes the SRAM cells to functionally fail and reduces the chip functional yield considering the static noise margin stability failures (i.e., cell flips when accessed), write failures (i.e., cell is not written within the write window), and read access failures (i.e., incorrect read operation). In this paper, novel negative capacitance circuits are developed, for the first time, to statistically improve the SRAM read access yield under process variations by reducing the bitlines parasitic capacitance. Post layout simulation results, referring to an industrial hardware-calibrated TSMC 65-nm CMOS technology, show that the adoption of the negative capacitance circuit to a 512 SRAM cells column is capable of improving the read access yield from 61.9% to 100%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118317/","volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6118317/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"13188354","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Statistical SRAM Read Access Yield Improvement Using Negative Capacitance Circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical SRAM Read Access Yield Improvement Using Negative Capacitance Circuits","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-mostafa-2178046-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088561S","chronDate":"Jan.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6387661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6387661","articleId":"6118317","onlineDate":"29 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6118343,"authors":[{"name":"Frank Jiang","affiliation":["School of Engineering and IT, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37891367900"},{"name":"Michael Frater","affiliation":["School of Engineering and IT, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Frater","id":"37282025800"},{"name":"Jiankun Hu","affiliation":["School of Engineering and IT, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Jiankun","lastName":"Hu","id":"37291272900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0006-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4612-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6118343","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Engines","Training","Fuzzy reasoning","Immune system","Computational modeling","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","distributed processing","fuzzy reasoning","hidden Markov models","pattern recognition","security of data","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired host based multiengine detection system","sequential pattern recognition","multilayered intrusion detection mechanisms","single engine intrusion alert system","distributed service oriented structure","hidden Markov model","immunology based self discrimination","immunology based nonself discrimination","fuzzy based inference process","HPSOWM","malicious attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Immunology","Anomaly intrusion detection","Fuzzy logic","Hidden Markov model","Multiple detection engines"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, multiple detection engines with multi-layered intrusion detection mechanisms are proposed. The principle is to coordinate the results from each single-engine intrusion alert system, by seamlessly integrating with the multiple layered distributed service-oriented structure. An improved hidden Markov model (HMM) is created for the detection engine which is capable of the immunology-based self/nonself discrimination. The classifications of normal and abnormal behaviours of system calls are further examined by an advanced fuzzy-based inference process called HPSOWM. Considering a real benchmark dataset from the public domain, our experimental results show that the proposed scheme can greatly shorten the training time of HMM and reduce the false positive rate significantly. The proposed HPSOWM especially works for the efficient classification of unknown behaviors and malicious attacks.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2011.46","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6118336/6118342/06118343.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2011.46","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6118342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bio-inspired Host-Based Multi-engine Detection System with Sequential Pattern Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6118343","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118343/","displayDocTitle":"A Bio-inspired Host-Based Multi-engine Detection System with Sequential Pattern Recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12525830","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6118343/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bio-inspired Host-Based Multi-engine Detection System with Sequential Pattern Recognition","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4612a145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075399S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6118336","isNumber":"6118342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6118336","xplore-issue":"6118342","articleId":"6118343","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6118348,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Jinling Institute of Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37538721400"},{"name":"Haifei Si","affiliation":["Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Jinling Institute of Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Haifei","lastName":"Si","id":"38241603100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0006-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4612-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6118348","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6118348","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Neural networks","Training","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Sensitivity","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","finite element analysis","matrix algebra","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","stiffness matrix","static test","finite element model","structure completely","static displacements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neural networks","stiffness matrix","static test","correction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DASC.2011.29","pdfPath":"/iel5/6118336/6118342/06118348.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","startPage":"27","endPage":"30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6118342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2011.29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Neural Networks to the Correction of a Stiffness Matrix by a Static Test","abstract":"It is important how to find the sources of error in a finite element model and how to correct them because the model established by analysis could not correspond to the real structure completely.

Experimental results show that the proposed model can achieve high qualities to perform well-designs and particularly, the design of chairs can be reached faster than traditional design models or the Kryssanov's model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov. 26 2011-Dec. 4 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118564/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12526439","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6118564/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","conferenceDate":"26 Nov.-4 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Design Model Based on Genetic Algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Design Model Based on Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Puebla, Mexico","sourcePdf":"4605a065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055439S","chronDate":"Nov. 26 2011-Dec. 4 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6118338","isNumber":"6118563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6118338","xplore-issue":"6118563","articleId":"6118564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6118584,"authors":[{"name":"Qinlong Jiang","affiliation":["School of computer engineering and science, Shanghai university, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qinlong","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38236354300"},{"name":"Weibing Feng","affiliation":["School of computer engineering and science, Shanghai university, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Weibing","lastName":"Feng","id":"38239984400"},{"name":"Junjie Peng","affiliation":["School of computer engineering and science, Shanghai university, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Junjie","lastName":"Peng","id":"37406138500"},{"name":"Fangfang Han","affiliation":["School of computer engineering and science, Shanghai university, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fangfang","lastName":"Han","id":"38239497200"},{"name":"Qing Li","affiliation":["School of computer engineering and science, Shanghai university, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Li","id":"37654639300"},{"name":"Wu Zhang","affiliation":["School of computer engineering and science, Shanghai university, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37278435100"},{"name":"Haitao Su","affiliation":["Beijing Benz-DaimlerChrysler Automotive Company Limited, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Haitao","lastName":"Su","id":"38240630400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0327-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4415-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6118584","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":353},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Cloning","Inventory control","Analytical models","Servers","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inventory-based resource management","virtual resource distribute","cloud data center","I/O performance","virtual machine","virtual disk image","cloud computing management platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["inventory","resource management","cloud computing","virtualization"]}],"abstract":"As a new application model, cloud computing enables users to distribute virtual resource in cloud data center as demand.

As high thermal conductivity, low permittivity and low thermal expansion coefficient of filler can endow composite with higher thermal conductivity, higher BD strength and lower thermal expansion coefficient respectively, BN (boron nitride) with high thermal conductivity, low permittivity and low thermal expansion coefficient was adopted as main filler in the research. Thermal conductivity was investigated in this part. The BD strength of samples will be discussed in Part II. Neat epoxy and other 25 kinds of epoxy/BN composites were prepared by a hot press method. Most of BN fillers were surface modified with silane coupling agent through ethanol/water reflux method to improve thermal conductivity. The values of 2.91 W/m\u00b7K, 3.95 W/m\u00b7K and 10.1 W/m\u00b7K as thermal conductivity were obtained for the composites that was single-loaded with h-BN(hexagonal boron nitride), c-BN (cubic boron nitride) or conglomerated h-BN, respectively. They were further improved to 5.26 W/m\u00b7K, 5.94 W/m\u00b7K and 12.3 W/m\u00b7K, respectively, by adding extra smaller A1N (aluminum nitride) to fill the voids in sample. Thermal conductivity of samples changes with the ratio of c-BN and h-BN when c-BN and h-BN were co-loaded. A value of 5.74 W/m\u00b7K as maximum was obtained at their ratio of 1 to 1 when total filler content is 80 wt%. A much higher value of 7.69 W/m\u00b7K was obtained by adding extra AIN. From the experiment data, it is concluded that the filler orientation in vertical direction of sample surface and the decrease of voids in sample are very important to obtain high thermal conductivity, and that the filler surface modification is also necessary to improve thermal conductivity especially for epoxy/c-BN composites, and addition of nano silica in small amount can also increase thermal conductivity if sample is prepared appropriately.","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2011.6118634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2011.6118634","startPage":"1963","endPage":"1972","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics

More and more attentions have gradually been paid to solve this kind of problems. An improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm based on feasibility rules is presented in this paper to solve constrained optimization problems. The average velocity of the swarm and the best history position in the particle's neighborhood are introduced as two turbulence factors, which are considered to influence the fly directions of particles, into the algorithm so as not to converge prematurely. The performance of IPSO algorithm is tested on 13 well-known benchmark functions. The experimental results show that the proposed IPSO algorithm is simple, effective and highly competitive.","doi":"10.1109/IBICA.2011.35","pdfPath":"/iel5/6118339/6118509/06118679.pdf","startPage":"124","endPage":"128","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Innovations in Bio-inspired Computing and Applications","publicationTitle":"2011 Second International Conference on Innovations in Bio-inspired Computing and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IBICA.2011.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6118509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving Constrained Optimization Problems by an Improved Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118679/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Solving Constrained Optimization Problems by an Improved Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12526506","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6118679/","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving Constrained Optimization Problems by an Improved Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"4606a124.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099021S","chronDate":"16-18 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6118339","isNumber":"6118509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6118339","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6118509","articleId":"6118679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6118703,"authors":[{"name":"Wu Yefu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Yefu","id":"37085958025"},{"name":"Li Bo","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Bo","id":"38236049500"},{"name":"Wu Chaozhong","affiliation":["Intelligent Traffic System Center, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Chaozhong","id":"37659431100"},{"name":"Pan Shigang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Pan","lastName":"Shigang","id":"37085956656"},{"name":"Shen Hui","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shen","lastName":"Hui","id":"38237917700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0327-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4415-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6118703","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Roads","Vectors","Artificial intelligence","Transfer functions","Educational institutions","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptrons","real-time systems","roads","traffic engineering computing","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time automatic evaluation technology","vehicle road test system","artificial intelligence technology","advanced automotive technology","automatic evaluation system","intelligent test system","China","multilayer neural network structure","transfer function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vehicle Road Test System","Neural Network","Automatic Evaluation","Artificial Intelligence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6118703","abstract":"With the development of computer, sensors, artificial intelligence technology, network, advanced automotive technology, the vehicle road test by a automatic evaluation system from the traditional manual evaluation has become an irresistible trend.

In the platform, we propose a Reputation System to evaluate the reliability of providers or resources to address this challenge, and we also propose a SLA template pool in order to make the SLA negotiation between cloud providers and cloud consumers become more equitable, transparent and convenient.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2011.184","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6118336/6118342/06118731.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2011.184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6118342","startPage":"1131","endPage":"1135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Conceptual Platform of SLA in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6118731","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Conceptual Platform of SLA in Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118731/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12525853","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6118731/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Conceptual Platform of SLA in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4612b131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064002S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6118336","isNumber":"6118342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6118336","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6118342","articleId":"6118731","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6118734,"authors":[{"name":"Lucio Agostinho","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Lucio","lastName":"Agostinho","id":"37586281500"},{"name":"Leonardo Olivi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Olivi","id":"38236659100"},{"name":"Guilherme Feliciano","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Guilherme","lastName":"Feliciano","id":"38234263500"},{"name":"Fernando Paolieri","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Paolieri","id":"37594400900"},{"name":"Diego Rodrigues","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Rodrigues","id":"37086709176"},{"name":"Eleri Cardozo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Eleri","lastName":"Cardozo","id":"37541623300"},{"name":"Eliane Guimaraes","affiliation":["Information Technology Center Renato Archer, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Eliane","lastName":"Guimaraes","id":"37541622600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0006-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4612-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6118734","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":877},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Protocols","Robot sensing systems","Cloud computing","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","control engineering computing","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","networked robotics","distributed robotics application","communication delay","REALabs platform","platform as a service","PaaS model","workflow cloud system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Networked Robotics","Platform as a Service","Cloud Workflow","Cloud Robotics"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a cloud computing environment for networked robotics.

In this paper, a new theoretical perspective from disruptive innovation theory has been integrated for addressing the observed emerging industrial paradigmshift -- cloud computing adoption on IT outsourcing industry disruption. By reviewing the state of cloud computing service from technical and social impact research and the status for IT outsourcing industry study, this paper seeks to address the knowledge gap of cloud computing enabled IT outsourcing disruption by synthesizing the academic discussion. It offers a roadmap of past IT outsourcing industry, cloud computing research and future IT operation implication. Inspired by the disruptive innovation analysis of cloud computing from a variety of service models, including IaaS, SaaS and PaaS, the author have identified a number of emerging challenges for IT outsourcing industry and laid the theoretical foundation for future research in this domain. Finally, in addition to theoretical contributions, the scenario-specific practical implication has been presented as managerial \"take-away\" for both industry incumbent and entrant.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disrupt the Disruptor: A Theoretical Approach of Cloud Computing on IT Outsourcing Industry Disruption","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2011.99","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6118336/6118342/06118739.pdf","startPage":"526","endPage":"531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2011.99","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6118342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6118739","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118739/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Disrupt the Disruptor: A Theoretical Approach of Cloud Computing on IT Outsourcing Industry Disruption","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6118739/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12525861","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disrupt the Disruptor: A Theoretical Approach of Cloud Computing on IT Outsourcing Industry Disruption","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4612a526.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107458S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6118336","isNumber":"6118342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6118336","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6118342","articleId":"6118739","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6118744,"authors":[{"name":"Zhicheng Jin","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Scalable Computing and Systems, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhicheng","lastName":"Jin","id":"38239113400"},{"name":"Jian Cao","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Scalable Computing and Systems, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Cao","id":"37277632000"},{"name":"Minglu Li","affiliation":["Shanghai Key Laboratory of Scalable Computing and Systems, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Minglu","lastName":"Li","id":"37278835500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0006-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4612-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6118744","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":238},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Application Component Placement Approach for Cloud Computing Environment","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6118336/6118342/06118744.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"495","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2011.94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6118342","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2011.94","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Electronic mail","Bandwidth","Hardware","Software","Algorithm design and analysis","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","data privacy","distributed processing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed application component placement problem","cloud computing","multicomponent application","IT infrastructure","ACP","network topology","privacy concern","distributed constraint optimization problem","DCOP"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ACP","Intelligent Agent","DCOP","DPOP"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6118744","abstract":"In cloud computing environment, it is common for a multi-component application to be deployed into the IT infrastructure on demand. Although the Application Component Placement Problem or ACP has been studied both in the academy and industry for some years, so far these approaches all rely on a centralized node to collect the information about the network topology and hosts of the targeting environment so that it can make the optimized decision. In cloud environment, computing resources are shared by many applications and the IT infrastructure is dynamically changing, which makes collecting the dynamic information of the environment a more difficult task. In addition, when two or more clouds are involved in the deployment, there may exist privacy concern between different clouds so that a centralized approach cannot be applied. In this paper, we propose a distributed approach to solve the ACP problem. In our approach, we transform the ACP into a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem or DCOP and solving the ACP becomes solving the DCOP.

The main contribution of this work is the presentation of a methodology for performing risk assessment in cloud environments including the target use cases, risk identification, mitigation and monitoring. Together with the corresponding mitigation strategies, the methodology provides technological assurance that will lead to a high confidence of Cloud service consumers on one side, and a cost effective and reliable productivity of cloud Service/Infrastructure Providers on the other side. The design of the risk assessment framework and its software toolkit implementation are part of the research and development work of the OPTIMIS (Optimized Infrastructure Services) project whose objective is to enable an open and dependable Cloud Service Ecosystem that delivers IT services that are adaptable, reliable, auditable and sustainable both ecologically and economically.

During the scheduling of such scientific applications for execution, various computation data flows will happen between the controller and computing server instances. Amongst various quality-of-service (QoS) metrics, data security is one of the greatest concerns to scientists because their data may be intercepted or stolen by malicious parties during those data flows. An existing typical method for addressing this issue is to apply Internet Key Exchange (IKE) scheme to generate and exchange session keys, and then to apply these keys for performing symmetric-key encryption which will encrypt those data flows. However, the IKE scheme suffers from low efficiency due to its low performance of asymmetric-key crypto logical operations over a large amount of data and high-density operations which are exactly the characteristics of scientific applications. In this paper, we propose Cloud Computing Background Key Exchange (CCBKE), a novel authenticated key exchange scheme that aims at efficient security-aware scheduling of scientific applications. Our scheme is designed based on randomness-reuse strategy and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) scheme. Theoretical analyses and simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the IKE scheme, our CCBKE scheme can significantly improve the efficiency by dramatically reducing time consumption and computation load without sacrificing the level of security.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2011.79","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6118336/6118342/06118759.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2011.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6118342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Authenticated Key Exchange Scheme for Efficient Security-Aware Scheduling of Scientific Applications in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6118759","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118759/","displayDocTitle":"An Authenticated Key Exchange Scheme for Efficient Security-Aware Scheduling of Scientific Applications in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12525881","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6118759/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Authenticated Key Exchange Scheme for Efficient Security-Aware Scheduling of Scientific Applications in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4612a372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100059S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6118336","isNumber":"6118342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6118336","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6118342","articleId":"6118759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6118762,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen J.J.

The SOPC approach takes on a co processing architecture to execute a Monte Carlo algorithm based random walk on boundary (WOB) method to calculate unit cube capacitance.

The performance results can be attributed to a streaming interface which connects the random number generator source and the coprocessor.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2011.75","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6118336/6118342/06118762.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2011.75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6118342","startPage":"351","endPage":"355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coprocessing Architecture in System-on-Programmable-Chip for Walk on the Boundary Method to Calculate Capacitance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6118762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coprocessing Architecture in System-on-Programmable-Chip for Walk on the Boundary Method to Calculate Capacitance","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118762/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12525884","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6118762/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coprocessing Architecture in System-on-Programmable-Chip for Walk on the Boundary Method to Calculate Capacitance","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4612a351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056486S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6118336","isNumber":"6118342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6118336","xplore-issue":"6118342","articleId":"6118762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6118796,"authors":[{"name":"Tongsheng Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Electronic Engineering, College of Heilongjiang, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Tongsheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38237021700"},{"name":"Qun Ding","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Electronic Engineering, College of Heilongjiang, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Ding","id":"37564460200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-1219-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4606-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6118796","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":498},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of CRC Based on FPGA","abstract":"In modern communication systems, high-speed and high-reliability is the two most important yardsticks, but digital code may be distorted during the transmission, so we should and must encoding some redundant bits to assure the received code correct to enhance the reliability of the communication systems.

Although there have been several attempts on characterizing the Twitter by using incomplete sampled data, they have not been very successful to estimate the characteristics of the whole network. In this paper, we characterize Twitter by sampling from its social graph and user behaviors through a random walk based sampling technique called Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS). To the best of our knowledge, for the first time RDS method and its estimator are used in order to obtain uniform unbiased estimation of several key structural and behavioral properties of Twitter. We compared the performance of the proposed method with other sampling methods such as Metropolis-Hasting Random Walk (MHRW) and sampling from active users (Timeline) against the uniform sampling (UNI). In order to gather the required data, we have implemented four independent crawlers. Our experimental results indicate that the RDS method exhibits lower estimation errors to the sample in- and out-degree distribution compared to MHRW and Timeline. We also show that RDS is more suitable to sample the followers vs. followings ratio, and the correlation between followers/followings vs. tweets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6118852/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12525895","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Characterizing Twitter with Respondent-Driven Sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing Twitter with Respondent-Driven Sampling","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4612b211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076999S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6118336","isNumber":"6118342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6118336","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6118342","articleId":"6118852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6118903,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed A.

Users are wondering about attacks on the integrity and the availability of their data in the cloud from malicious insiders and outsiders, and from any collateral damage of cloud services. These issues are extremely significant but there is still much room for security research in cloud computing. This paper focuses more on the issues related to the data security and privacy aspects in cloud computing, such as data integrity, data intrusion, service availability. It proposes a Multi-clouds Database Model (MCDB) which is based on Multi-clouds service providers instead of using single cloud service provider such as in Amazon cloud service. In addition, it will discuss and present the architecture of the proposed MCDB model and describe its components and layers.

This would be essential for real-time streaming multimedia applications like online gaming and watching movies on a pay as you use basis hosted in a cloud computing environment. However, guaranteeing or even predicting QoS in global and diverse networks supporting complex hosting of application services is a very challenging issue that needs a stepwise refinement approach to be solved as the technology of cloud computing matures. In this paper, we investigate if latency in terms of simple Ping measurements can be used as an indicator for other QoS parameters such as jitter and throughput. The experiments were carried out on a global scale, between servers placed in universities in Denmark, Poland, Brazil and Malaysia. The results show some correlation between latency and throughput, and between latency and jitter, even though the results are not completely consistent. As a side result, we were able to monitor the changes in QoS parameters during a number of 24-hour periods. This is also a first step towards defining QoS parameters to be included in Service Level Agreements for cloud computing in the foreseeable future.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2011.120","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6118336/6118342/06118936.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2011.120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6118342","startPage":"682","endPage":"689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Assessing Measurements of QoS for Global Cloud Computing Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6118936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Assessing Measurements of QoS for Global Cloud Computing Services","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6118936/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12525959","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6118936/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assessing Measurements of QoS for Global Cloud Computing Services","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4612a682.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071847S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6118336","isNumber":"6118342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6118336","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6118342","articleId":"6118936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6119009,"authors":[{"name":"Andres Espinal","affiliation":["Instituto Tecnologico de Leon, Leon, Guanajuato, MX"],"firstName":"Andres","lastName":"Espinal","id":"37086039069"},{"name":"Marco Sotelo-Figueroa","affiliation":["Instituto Tecnologico de Leon, Leon, Guanajuato, MX"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Sotelo-Figueroa","id":"38315295900"},{"name":"Jorge A.

However, cloud providers should tackle the challenge of configuring their systems to provide maximal performance while minimizing customer's cost of computing resources, which satisfy the customers' various workload requirements. To solve the above challenge, in this paper, we propose an innovative architecture of self-adaptive configuration optimization system which supports dynamic reconfiguration when workloads change. In addition, we develop an optimization algorithm by using genetic algorithm for this system. By using queuing theory and statistic techniques, we model and compute the SLAs metrics which are defined as the fitness function in the optimization algorithm. This optimization system can guide cloud customers to purchase appropriate resources and make decision of deployment configuration such as scale, scheduling and capacity.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2011.112","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6118336/6118342/06119056.pdf","startPage":"621","endPage":"627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2011.112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6118342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Innovative Self-Adaptive Configuration Optimization System in Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119056/","displayDocTitle":"An Innovative Self-Adaptive Configuration Optimization System in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6119056/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12525967","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Innovative Self-Adaptive Configuration Optimization System in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4612a621.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089825S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6118336","isNumber":"6118342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6118336","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6118342","articleId":"6119056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6119059,"authors":[{"name":"Lucio Agostinho","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Lucio","lastName":"Agostinho","id":"37586281500"},{"name":"Guilherme Feliciano","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Guilherme","lastName":"Feliciano","id":"38234263500"},{"name":"Leonardo Olivi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Leonardo","lastName":"Olivi","id":"38236659100"},{"name":"Eleri Cardozo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Eleri","lastName":"Cardozo","id":"37541623300"},{"name":"Eliane Guimaraes","affiliation":["Information Technology Center Renato Archer, Campinas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Eliane","lastName":"Guimaraes","id":"37541622600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0006-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4612-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6119059","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":554},"abstract":"In cloud computing the allocation and scheduling of multiple virtual resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), are still a challenge. The optimization of these processes bring the advantage of improving the energy savings and load balancing in large data centers. Resource allocation and scheduling also impact in federated clouds where resources can be leased from partner domains. This paper proposes a bio-inspired VM allocation method based on Genetic Algorithms to optimize the VM distribution across federated cloud domains. The main contribution of this work is an inter-domain allocation algorithm that takes into account the capacity of the links connecting the domains in order to avoid quality of service degradation for VMs allocated on partner domains. An architecture to simulate federated clouds is also a contribution of this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6118336/6118342/06119059.pdf","startPage":"598","endPage":"604","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2011.109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2011.109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6118342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bio-inspired Approach to Provisioning of Virtual Resources in Federated Clouds","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Resource management","Cloud computing","Biological cells","Scheduling","Bandwidth","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","genetic algorithms","power aware computing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired approach","virtual resources","federated clouds","cloud computing","virtual machines","VM","energy savings","load balancing","data centers","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Genetic Algorithms","Resource Allocation","Federated Clouds"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119059/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Bio-inspired Approach to Provisioning of Virtual Resources in Federated Clouds","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6119059/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12525970","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bio-inspired Approach to Provisioning of Virtual Resources in Federated Clouds","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4612a598.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076126S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6118336","isNumber":"6118342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6118336","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6118342","articleId":"6119059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6119060,"authors":[{"name":"Kongluan Lin","affiliation":["QCIS, FEIT, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Kongluan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37596509200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0006-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4612-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6119060","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile communication","Base stations","Joints","Conferences","Genetic algorithms","Accuracy","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","data mining","genetic algorithms","Long Term Evolution","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency improvement","LTE networks","genetic algorithm","wireless cellular networks","environment benefits","economical benefits","network operators","energy-efficient base stations","light radio cubes","data mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE networks","energy efficiency","genetic algorithm","data mining"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119060","abstract":"The improvement of energy efficiency in wireless cellular networks has become a popular topic in recent years due to its positive effects on the environment and economical benefits for network operators.

The existing architectures are not designed to exploit the contextual properties of cloud computing. The emergence of cloud computing virtually forces cloud consumers to re-evaluate their software architectures in light of the cloud computing context which requires relinquish control over most architectural components to cloud providers. In a cloud-enabled architecture, the shift of ownership of and control over architectural components from consumers to cloud providers has profound impact on the ways cloud consumers design their software architecture. In this perspective, we go beyond the traditional definition of software architecture, and introduce the concepts of architectural scope, ownership, and control as the contextual properties of an architecture.","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2011.104","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Ninth International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/6118336/6118342/06119072.pdf","startPage":"561","endPage":"568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2011.104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6118342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying Contextual Properties of Software Architecture in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119072/","displayDocTitle":"Identifying Contextual Properties of Software Architecture in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12525983","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6119072/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying Contextual Properties of Software Architecture in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"4612a561.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058105S","chronDate":"12-14 Dec. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6118336","isNumber":"6118342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6118336","xplore-issue":"6118342","articleId":"6119072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6119083,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Wu","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Fan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37980777800"},{"name":"Yuming Mao","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Yuming","lastName":"Mao","id":"37274109700"},{"name":"Supeng Leng","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Supeng","lastName":"Leng","id":"37602353100"},{"name":"Xiaoyan Huang","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoyan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37900721200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-0006-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4612-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6119083","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":595},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Niobium","Resource management","Throughput","Optimal scheduling","Algorithm design and analysis","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","next generation networks","resource allocation","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier aggregation based resource allocation scheme","pervasive wireless networks","bandwidth capability","transmission performance optimization","component carrier aggregation","resource optimization problem","resource block assignment","component carrier scheduling","minimizing system utility loss algorithm","network utility","next generation wireless networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["carrier aggregation","network utility","proportional fair","joint resource allocation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119083","abstract":"The mixture of users with different bandwidth capability presents new challenges to optimize the transmission performance of the next generation wireless networks.

A key component of the technique is the CMOS chip-based self-aligned masking. This allows for the fabrication of sockets in wafers that are at most 5 \u03bcm larger than the chip on each side. The chip and the large area substrate are bonded onto a carrier such that the top surfaces of the two components are flush. The unique features of this technique enable the integration of macroscale components, such as leads and microfluidics. Furthermore, the integration process allows for microelectromechanical systems micromachining after CMOS die-wafer integration. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed technology, a low-power integrated potentiostat chip for biosensing implemented in the AMI Semiconductor's 0.5 \u03bcm CMOS technology is integrated in a silicon substrate. The horizontal gap and the vertical displacement between the chip and the large area substrate measured after the integration were 4 and 0.5 \u03bcm, respectively. A number of 104 interconnects are patterned with high-precision alignment. Electrical measurements have shown that the functionality of the chip is not affected by the integration process.

It is shown that, in the aforementioned legacy MMF systems, center launching enables an adaptive power-loaded OOFDM transmission at a raw signal bit rate of 11.25 Gb/s over an unprecedented distance of 2000 m with an optical power penalty as low as 0.8 dB. When center launching is replaced by conventional offset launching, the transmission distance of the legacy MMF system is reduced to 300 m, and the corresponding optical power penalty is increased to 2.3 dB. Comparisons of measured maximum achievable transmission distances of various MMF IMDD system configurations subject to different launching conditions show that DM-VCSEL-based, adaptive power-loaded OOFDM at center launching is a viable and cost-effective solution for use in legacy MMF systems.

Transmitted data are approximated as an infinitely long sequence of random bits, which is experimentally a hypothesis confirmed for the S-band XM radio signal. On July 2, 2010, a signal recorder was flown at an altitude of 3.17 km off the coast of Virginia, collecting ocean-reflected signals from both geostationary satellites identified as \u201cRhythm\u201d and \u201cBlues,\u201d which were broadcasting the XM radio signal. Direct and reflected signals from the same channel were cross-correlated, producing a waveform that agreed well with a model generated at the 7.5-m/s wind speed reported from the Chesapeake Lighthouse. Adjusting this model to fit the experimental data produced an optimal estimate of 6 m/s. A Monte Carlo approach predicted errors of 0.5% from the simulated reflected XM radio signals and 2%-10% from simulated reflected Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS-R) signals. This improvement was attributed to the higher ( ~ 30 dB) power in the XM radio signal. The availability of communication satellite transmissions, in all frequency bands used for remote sensing, opens the possibility of using signals of opportunity as low-cost alternatives to radiometry or scatterometry.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119195/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2012","dateOfInsertion":"07 May 2012","accessionNumber":"12712336","htmlLink":"/document/6119195/","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of Bistatic Radar for Ocean Remote Sensing Using Communication Satellite Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of Bistatic Radar for Ocean Remote Sensing Using Communication Satellite Signals","sourcePdf":"lgrs-shah-2177061-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056992S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6196241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6196241","articleId":"6119195","onlineDate":"30 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6119197,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Jiang","affiliation":["Tate Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Cheng","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38243449400"},{"name":"Hongyan Zhang","affiliation":["Tate Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hongyan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406804700"},{"name":"Huanfeng Shen","affiliation":["School of Resource and Environmental Science, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Huanfeng","lastName":"Shen","id":"37405266500"},{"name":"Liangpei Zhang","affiliation":["Tate Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Liangpei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37292618700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"6119197","dbTime":"56 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":107,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1310},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Remote sensing","Spatial resolution","Sensors","Training","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","geophysical image processing","image fusion","image resolution","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing-based pan-sharpening method","high-resolution multispectral image fusion","HRM image fusion","remote sensing application","low-resolution multispectral imaging","LRM imaging","CS-based pan-sharpening method","image observation model","measurement process","CS theory","joint dictionary construction","remote sensing image fusion","IKONOS imaging","image quality","visual evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing (CS)","image fusion","joint dictionary","tradeoff"]}],"abstract":"High-resolution multispectral (HRM) images are widely used in many remote sensing applications.

To insert an object into an image, properly size a foreign object is difficult, especially when there is no reference object in the same distance. To detect this type of image forgery, we present a perspective-constraint based method, with which the height ratio of two objects in an image can be determined without any knowledge of the camera parameters. Assuming that the camera is held leveled and with negligible tilt, the height ratio can be found merely by a vanishing line of the plane on which both objects of interest is situated. Once the estimated ratio exceeds a tolerable interval, a forged region is identified.

The topology is simple to realize while offering a higher number of switching states without the need for capacitor voltage balancing algorithms, when compared to the standard multilevel converters. This paper extends the open-end winding concept to a five-phase drive. A relatively simple space-vector modulation (SVM) algorithm, based on the already well-understood five-phase two-level drive SVM method, is developed. The proposed modulation technique has the advantage of being straightforward to implement and, like its two-level counterpart, is able to generate output voltages with minimum low-order harmonic content. The method generates up to 17-level output phase voltage and, therefore, offers superior harmonic performance when compared to the two-level five-phase modulation. The developed scheme is verified via detailed simulations and experiments, using a five-phase induction machine operating under open-loop V/f control.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2011.2178074","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel5/60/6152302/06119210.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6152302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2011.2178074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Space-Vector Modulation Scheme for Multilevel Open-End Winding Five-Phase Drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119210","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Space-Vector Modulation Scheme for Multilevel Open-End Winding Five-Phase Drives","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119210/","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6119210/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12537574","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Space-Vector Modulation Scheme for Multilevel Open-End Winding Five-Phase Drives","sourcePdf":"tec-levi-2178074-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075753S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"6152302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"6152302","articleId":"6119210","onlineDate":"30 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6119218,"authors":[{"name":"Abhijit Kadrolkar","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Amherst, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6165484/6119218/6119218-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Abhijit Kadrolkar received the M.S. degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 2010, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include nonlinear dynamics, energy-aware systems of operation in wireless sensor networks, and control of electromechanical systems with a focus on rehabilitation engineering."]},"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Kadrolkar","id":"37658860200"},{"name":"Robert X.

This research is motivated by the need for extended service life of wireless sensor networks, where individual sensor nodes are energy constrained. Theoretical background is introduced, and its effectiveness is established through simulations and experiments. The simulations are conducted using electrocardiogram (ECG) and bearing vibration signals, and the results are comparatively evaluated against the Haar transform coding, discrete cosine transform (DCT) coding, pulse code modulation, and fixed-word-length Walsh coding. Experimental verification is performed by implementing the algorithm on a wireless test bed. Results indicate that up to 58% energy reduction can be achieved for wireless transmission of ECG signals, as compared to other commonly used coding methods. For bearing vibration signal transmission, the energy consumed during transmission is comparable to that of the near-optimal DCT coding.","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6165484/06119218.pdf","startPage":"850","endPage":"864","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2176229","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2176229","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119218","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Discrete cosine transforms","Data communication","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical communication","data compression","discrete cosine transforms","electrocardiography","Haar transforms","pulse code modulation","transform coding","variable length codes","Walsh functions","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable-word-length coding","energy-aware signal transmission","data transmission","energy-efficient method","data compression","signal source coding method","Walsh transform","of wireless sensor networks","sensor nodes","electrocardiogram","bearing vibration signals","Haar transform coding","discrete cosine transform coding","pulse code modulation","fixed-word-length Walsh coding","energy reduction","ECG signal wireless transmission","vibration signal transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data compression","energy-aware signal transmission","Walsh transform","wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Variable-Word-Length Coding for Energy-Aware Signal Transmission","accessionNumber":"12576961","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","publicationDate":"April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6119218/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable-Word-Length Coding for Energy-Aware Signal Transmission","sourcePdf":"tim-gao-2176229-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072827S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6165484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6165484","articleId":"6119218","onlineDate":"30 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6119224,"authors":[{"name":"Jianquan Lu","affiliation":["Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, Potsdam, Germany","Department of Mathematics, South East University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6145493/6119224/6119224-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianquan Lu received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Zhejiang Normal University, Zhejiang, China, the M.S. degree in mathematics from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, and the Ph.D. degree from the City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, in 2003, 2006, and 2009, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Mathematics, Southeast University.

Some generic mean square stability criteria are derived in terms of algebraic conditions, which guarantee that the whole state-coupled dynamical network can be forced to some desired trajectory by placing impulsive controllers on a small fraction of nodes. An effective method is given to select the nodes which should be controlled at each impulsive constants. The proportion of the controlled nodes guaranteeing the stability is explicitly obtained, and the synchronization region is also derived and clearly plotted.

A very promising device is the 1200 V 30 A JFET manufactured by SemiSouth. It features a very low on-resistance per die area (2.8 m\u03a9-cm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n), switching within 20 ns, normally off characteristic, high-temperature operation and has already been commercialized in contrast to many other SiC switches. To fully exploit the potential of the SiC normally off JFET, conventional gate drivers for unipolar devices must be adapted to this device due to its special requirements. During on-state, the gate voltage must not exceed 3 V, while a current of around 300 mA (depending on the desired on-resistance) must be fed into the gate; during switching operation, the transient gate-source voltage should be around \u00b115 V and the low threshold voltage of less than 0.7 V requires a high noise immunity which is a severe challenge as the device has a comparably low gate-source but high gate-drain capacitance. To meet these requirements, several concepts have been published recently. They deal with the challenges mentioned, but they still show certain limitations (e.g., frequency and duty cycle limitations or need for additional cooling due to high gate driver losses). In this paper, a novel gate driver consisting of only one standard gate driver IC, resistors, capacitors, and diodes is designed and experimentally validated. It supplies enough gate current for minimum on-resistance, allows fast switching operation, features a high noise immunity, and can be used for any duty cycle and typical switching frequencies without significant self-heating.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel AC-Coupled Gate Driver for Ultrafast Switching of Normally Off SiC JFETs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2011.2182209","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/63/6177741/06119229.pdf","startPage":"3452","endPage":"3463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2011.2182209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6177741","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119229","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119229/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","displayDocTitle":"Novel AC-Coupled Gate Driver for Ultrafast Switching of Normally Off SiC JFETs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6119229/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12638760","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel AC-Coupled Gate Driver for Ultrafast Switching of Normally Off SiC JFETs","sourcePdf":"tpel-wrzecionko-2182209-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079078S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6177741","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6177741","articleId":"6119229","onlineDate":"30 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6119232,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6165492/6119232/6119232-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jing Huang (S'10) received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2006 and the M.S. degree in communications and information systems from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2009.","He is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine.

Both the cases of direct transmission and cooperative jamming with a helper are investigated with imperfect channel state information (CSI) for the eavesdropper links. Robust transmit covariance matrices are obtained based on worst-case secrecy rate maximization, under both individual and global power constraints. For the case of an individual power constraint, we show that the nonconvex maximin optimization problem can be transformed into a quasi-convex problem that can be efficiently solved with existing methods. For a global power constraint, the joint optimization of the transmit covariance matrices and power allocation between the source and the helper is studied. We also investigate the robust wiretap transmission problem for the case with a quality-of-service constraint at the legitimate receiver. Numerical results show the advantage of the proposed robust design. In particular, for the global power constraint scenario, although cooperative jamming is not necessary for optimal transmission with perfect eavesdropper's CSI, we show that robust jamming support can increase the worst-case secrecy rate and lower the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio at the eavesdropper in the presence of channel mismatches between the transmitters and the eavesdropper.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2182344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2182344","startPage":"1696","endPage":"1707","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6165492/06119232.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Secure Transmission in MISO Channels Based on Worst-Case Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2011","displayDocTitle":"Robust Secure Transmission in MISO Channels Based on Worst-Case Optimization","volume":"60","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12591171","publicationDate":"April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6119232/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Secure Transmission in MISO Channels Based on Worst-Case Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsp-huang-2182344-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12302S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6165492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"177","xplore-issue":"6165492","articleId":"6119232","onlineDate":"30 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":6119233,"authors":[{"name":"Satya Krishna Joshi","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Satya Krishna","lastName":"Joshi","id":"38355301100"},{"name":"Pradeep Chathuranga Weeraddana","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Automatic and Networked Control Laboratory, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Pradeep Chathuranga","lastName":"Weeraddana","id":"38271318000"},{"name":"Marian Codreanu","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Marian","lastName":"Codreanu","id":"37268997300"},{"name":"Matti Latva-aho","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Latva-aho","id":"37270610400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6119233","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1499},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119233","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Optimization","Convergence","Upper bound","Downlink","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","communication complexity","optimisation","radio links","radiofrequency interference","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted sum-rate maximization","MISO downlink cellular network","multicell downlink multiple-input single-output system","MISO system","NP-hard","branch and bound technique","nonconvex WSRMax problem","bounding technique","conic optimization","numerical simulation","network design","system performance metric","Lipschitz continuous","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Branch and bound","global (nonconvex) optimization","multicell networks","second-order cone program (SOCP)","weighted sum-rate maximization"]}],"abstract":"The problem of weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRMax) in multicell downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems is considered.

The most commonly used least-mean-square-error (LMSE) filter is optimal when the noise is Gaussian. However, in many practical applications, the noise can be modeled more accurately using a non-Gaussian distribution. In this correspondence, we consider non-Gaussian distributions for the noise model and show that the filter of using entropy bound minimization (EBM) leads to significant performance gain compared to the LMSE filter. The least mean p-norm (LMP) filter using the \u03b1-stable distribution to model noise is shown to be the maximum-likelihood solution when using the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) to model noise. The GGD model for noise allows us to compute the Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the error in estimating the weights. Simulations show that both the EBM and LMP filters achieve the CRLB as the sample size increases. The EBM filter is shown to be less committed with respect to unseen data yielding generally superior performance in online learning when compared to LMP. We also show that, when the noise comes from impulsive \u03b1 -stable distributions, both the EBM and LMP filters provide better performance than LMSE. In addition, the EBM filter offers the advantage that it does not assume a certain parametric model for the noise, and by proper selection of the measuring functions, it can be adapted to a wide range of noise distributions.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2182345","startPage":"2049","endPage":"2055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2182345","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165492","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6165492/06119235.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Class of Adaptive Algorithms Based on Entropy Estimation Achieving CRLB for Linear Non-Gaussian Filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119235/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Class of Adaptive Algorithms Based on Entropy Estimation Achieving CRLB for Linear Non-Gaussian Filtering","volume":"60","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6119235/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12591174","publicationDate":"April 2012","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Class of Adaptive Algorithms Based on Entropy Estimation Achieving CRLB for Linear Non-Gaussian Filtering","sourcePdf":"tsp-li-2182345-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124969S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6165492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6165492","articleId":"6119235","onlineDate":"30 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6119236,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o F.

Recently, it has been shown that significant performance gains can be achieved by cooperation among base stations. Different degrees of cooperation are possible. In this paper, cooperation in the form of intercell interference management is considered. The base stations are equipped with multiple antennas, while the mobile terminals only have a single antenna. The base stations jointly coordinate beamforming and scheduling, and thus perform a weaker form of cooperation among base stations than suggested in recently proposed joint transmission techniques. The terminals treat intercell interference as noise. The corresponding resource allocation problem is cast as a utility maximization problem, which includes common performance objectives such as the arithmetic mean, the geometric mean, and the max-min operation of achievable user rates. The resulting utility maximization problem is a nonconvex optimization problem. After a suitable reformulation, the problem can be solved to global optimality using the framework of monotonic optimization. Although, the numerical complexity of the proposed method is exponential, the reformulation step leads to an optimization problem which only scales in the number of mobile terminals instead of the entire set of physical layer parameters. In essence, the proposed framework represents a powerful tool for computing benchmarks for certain scenarios and utility functions under jointly optimal beamforming and scheduling.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2182343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6165492/06119237.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2182343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6165492","startPage":"1899","endPage":"1909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monotonic Optimization Framework for Coordinated Beamforming in Multicell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119237","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Monotonic Optimization Framework for Coordinated Beamforming in Multicell Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12591176","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6119237/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monotonic Optimization Framework for Coordinated Beamforming in Multicell Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-utschick-2182343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09934S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6165492","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6165492","articleId":"6119237","onlineDate":"30 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6119238,"authors":[{"name":"Dong-Min Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Min","lastName":"Shin","id":"37533901200"},{"name":"Hansul Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hansul","lastName":"Cho","id":"38237917900"},{"name":"Kyeongcheol Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyeongcheol","lastName":"Yang","id":"37334970200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6119238","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":422},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Quadrature amplitude modulation","MIMO","Phase shift keying","Vectors","Closed-form solutions","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","error statistics","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general closed-form expressions","symbol error rate","bit error rate","decision-feedback detection","error propagation","MIMO fading channels","multiple-input-multiple-output system","Rayleigh fading channel","event concept","state concept","quadrature-amplitude modulation","phase-shift keying","QAM","PSK","transmit antennas","receive antennas","asymptotic BER performance","Monte Carlo simulation","wireless communication systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decision-feedback detection (DFD)","error propagation","multiple input\u2013multiple output (MIMO)","phase-shift keying (PSK)","quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM)"]}],"abstract":"The symbol error rate (SER) and bit error rate (BER) of the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system with decision-feedback detection (DFD) are analyzed over a Rayleigh fading channel.

Our approach can be extended to the exact performance analysis of various wireless communication systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"General Closed-Form Expressions for the SER and BER of Decision-Feedback Detection With Error Propagation Over MIMO Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2182218","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6151237/06119238.pdf","startPage":"882","endPage":"889","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2182218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151237","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119238/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","displayDocTitle":"General Closed-Form Expressions for the SER and BER of Decision-Feedback Detection With Error Propagation Over MIMO Fading Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6119238/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12527213","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"General Closed-Form Expressions for the SER and BER of Decision-Feedback Detection With Error Propagation Over MIMO Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-2182218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08088S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6151237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6151237","articleId":"6119238","onlineDate":"30 December 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6119247,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Geyer","affiliation":["University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"p":["Tobias Geyer (t.geyer@ieee.org) is with the University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand.

Needle deflection and tissue deformation are major problems for accurate needle insertion. A neural network based observer is introduced to estimate the flexible modes of the flexible-link.

While performing a test, a false negative result may be created because of external air turbulence caused by the rotation of the test disk. The objective of this paper is to find a model of the servo system in HGA testing system so that we know how to adjust the command to get rid of the effect of disturbance. The technique so called Transfer Function Determination Code (TFDC) is proposed to model the system in the frequency domain. In addition, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to adjust the weights in TFDC algorithm in each frequency.

The voltage step on both the filter inductors and the switching devices in the new topology is only half of the input voltage, which offers a smaller size of the inductors. Only one of the switches is operated at high switching frequency at any time, which offers lower switching losses. Moreover, the operation principle and modulation of the proposed topology are analyzed in detail, and a prototype is built.

Unfortunately, due to the non-galvanic isolation configuration, the ground leakage current would appear through the PV parasitic capacitance into the ground, which induces the physical danger and serious EMI problems. A novel transformerless single-phase inverter with two unipolar SPWM control strategies is proposed in this paper. The inverter can guarantee no ground leakage current and high reliability by applying either of the SPWM strategies. Meanwhile, the low total harmonic distortion (THD) of the grid-connected current is achieved thanks to the alleviation of the dead time effect. Besides, the required input DC voltage is the same low as that of the full-bridge inverter. Furthermore, the output filter inductance is reduced greatly due to the three-level output voltage, which leads to the high power density and high efficiency. At last, a 1kW prototype has been built and tested to verify the theoretical analysis of the paper.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119466","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119466.pdf","startPage":"1126","endPage":"1130","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel single-phase transformerless grid-connected inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"A novel single-phase transformerless grid-connected inverter","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6119466/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12538308","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119466/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel single-phase transformerless grid-connected inverter","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"1126mf010421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055681S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6119475,"authors":[{"name":"June-seok Lee","affiliation":["Division of electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"June-seok Lee","id":"37087363290"},{"name":"Duk-Hong Kang","affiliation":["Division of electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Duk-Hong Kang","id":"37087362133"},{"name":"Hea-Gwang Jeong","affiliation":["Division of electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hea-Gwang Jeong","id":"37087362086"},{"name":"Kyo-Beum Lee","affiliation":["Division of electrical and Computer Engineering, Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyo-Beum","lastName":"Lee","id":"37281493000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-972-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-969-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-971-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"6119475","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":272},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Power harmonic filters","Resonant frequency","Filtering algorithms","Damping","Harmonic analysis","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","discrete Fourier transforms","electric sensing devices","power grids","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale wind power system","LCL-filter","switching frequency","grid side current","filter resonance","active damping method","DFT filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119475","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119475.pdf","startPage":"1179","endPage":"1184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active damping for large-scale wind power systems with an LCL-filter using an improved DFT","abstract":"This paper proposes a simple active damping algorithm for a large-scale wind power system with an LCL-filter.

The presented 2D finite element model and the simulation procedure are oriented towards this approach and are developed by means of the FEM software ANSYS. The analysis shows how the transient flux linkage imposed by voltage pulses is influenced by a broken bar leading to very distinct rotor-fixed modulation, that can be clearly exploited for monitoring. Simulation results are presented to show the transient flux paths.

Each of these components is usually operated at or near its rated values. In addition, high dynamic operation, overload cycles, as well as the fast switching of the power devices puts additional stress on all drive components. As a consequence overall reliability is reduced. Especially in security critical applications a continuous monitoring of the different components is thus necessary. In order to detect possible defects in an early stage or to enable prediction of a developing fault very sensitive measurement and evaluation methods are essential. In this paper a new method is proposed to monitor the state of different drive components like windings insulation, cabling and power electronics very accurately. The method is based on the current sensors available in the inverter in combination with a high frequency sampling. Each change in the switching state of the inverter leads to a transient voltage excitation of the electrical system consisting of power electronics, cabling, machine windings, leading to a step response of the machine current. Assuming a sufficient high sampling rate of the current, the characteristic features of the step response like eigenfrequency, damping rate and steady state value can be calculated and compared. Each of these characteristic values is influenced by the inductances, capacitances and resistances of the system. If for example the inter-turn insulation deteriorates the capacitance changes before the actual breakdown leading to a change in the mentioned characteristic values. Measurement results are presented to verify the applicability to detect changes in the phase winding capacity.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119605","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119605.pdf","startPage":"1954","endPage":"1959","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online detection of insulation degradation in inverter fed drive systems based on high frequency current sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Online detection of insulation degradation in inverter fed drive systems based on high frequency current sampling","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6119605/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12537936","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119605/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online detection of insulation degradation in inverter fed drive systems based on high frequency current sampling","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"1954mf006726.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064573S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6119609,"authors":[{"name":"Biwen Xu","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Biwen Xu","id":"37087671769"},{"name":"Xiaofeng Lv","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Xiaofeng Lv","id":"37087953700"},{"name":"Zirui Jia","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Zirui Jia","id":"37087957284"},{"name":"Min Chen","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Min Chen","id":"37087169156"},{"name":"Zhaoming Qian","affiliation":["College of Electrical Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Zhaoming Qian","id":"37087146203"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-972-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-969-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-971-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"6119609","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":170},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["High intensity discharge lamps","Generators","Aging","Voltage control","Steady-state","Automotive engineering","Current control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","automotive engineering","DC-DC power convertors","discharge lamps","electric current control","feedback","ignition","power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive current control strategy","automotive HID lamp","full digital platform","lamp voltage","power control","current feedback control mode","high ignition success rate","current response speed","DC-DC converter","adaptive current reference generator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119609","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119609.pdf","startPage":"2877","endPage":"2882","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive current control strategy for automotive HID lamps with full digital platform","abstract":"This paper presents an adaptive current control strategy for automotive HID lamps.

The resolution of the positioning systems using this type of motors has been increased with the introduction of the microstepping driving technique, even if, being operated in open loop, HSM cannot provide the actual control of the load position. Recently, the authors have proposed an innovative control scheme, based on the use of a load side acceleration sensor, that implements the active damping of a HSM-driven mechanical load, in presence of a flexible mechanical transmission between motor and load. This is a typical industrial scenario, in which the problem of the oscillations arising from the excitation of the mechanical resonance by various disturbances (including torque ripple) is usually addressed by severely limiting the overall dynamic performance. In this paper, we propose the extension of the proposed technique, with the use of a MEMS gyroscope to implement an active damping control strategy, which allows for the improvement of the dynamic response and an excellent rejection of the oscillations caused by the torque ripple. The proposed technique does not require the re-design of the existing equipments, since it is based on the real time modulation of the orientation of the stator flux, aimed at producing a compensating torque and, in turn, damping the oscillatory modes. Experimental results, obtained with a HSM-driven camera positioning unit, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6119645/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12537974","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Use of MEMS gyroscopes in active vibration damping for HSM-driven positioning systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of MEMS gyroscopes in active vibration damping for HSM-driven positioning systems","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"2176mf007595.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06306S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6119669,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Yan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Yan","id":"37274913200"},{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280531600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-972-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-969-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-971-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"6119669","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119669","abstract":"This paper proposes a neural network approach to nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC).

In this work, relearning strategy is adopted in asynchronous particle swarm optimizer (PSO) to enhance its convergence. Although asynchronous PSO converges faster than synchronous PSO in most cases, it cannot guarantee a high successful rate of reproduction of better offspring in each generation. When a particle cannot search a better personal best position, the relearning strategy is utilized to enforce the particle learn again according to the original PSO formula. Moreover, a new mutation operator called Gaussian hypermutation is proposed to maintain the population diversity. Simulation results based on nine benchmark functions show that relearning strategy significantly improves the performance of asynchronous PSO.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119675","startPage":"2341","endPage":"2346","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119675.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous particle swarm optimizer with relearning strategy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Particle swarm optimization","Convergence","Benchmark testing","Genetic algorithms","Learning systems","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous particle swarm optimizer","relearning strategy","PSO","mutation operator","Gaussian hypermutation","population diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous particle swarm optimizer with relearning strategy","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6119675/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12538002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous particle swarm optimizer with relearning strategy","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"2341mf005509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063042S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6119677,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuhiko Takahashi","affiliation":["Information Systems Design, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37277671400"},{"name":"Motoki Kurokawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Motoki","lastName":"Kurokawa","id":"38237301700"},{"name":"Masafumi Hashimoto","affiliation":["Intelligent Information Engineering, Doshisha University, Kyotanabe, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Masafumi","lastName":"Hashimoto","id":"37286669300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-972-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-969-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-971-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"6119677","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119677","abstract":"This paper investigates a quantum neural network and discusses its application to control systems.

According to the experimental results of a robot, the proposed intelligent forecasting system can provide high accuracy for both trajectory prediction and target tracking.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119682/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12538009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6119682/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Integration of grey model and neural network for robotic application","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integration of grey model and neural network for robotic application","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"2382mf002585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086871S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6119684,"authors":[{"name":"Yuya Itou","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuya","lastName":"Itou","id":"38234358600"},{"name":"Takashi Tomono","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Tomono","id":"38021240700"},{"name":"Mamoru Minami","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Mamoru","lastName":"Minami","id":"37280393200"},{"name":"Akira Yanou","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Yanou","id":"37277313200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-972-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-969-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-971-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"6119684","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119684","abstract":"Continuous catching and releasing experiment of several fishes makes the fishes find some escaping strategies such as staying stationary at corner of the pool. To make fish-catching robot intelligent more than fishes' adapting and escaping abilities from chasing net attached at robot's hand, we thought something that goes beyond the fishes' adapting intelligence will be required. Here we propose a chaos-generator comprising Neural-Network-Differential-Equation(NNDE) and an evolving mechanism to have the NNDE generate chaotic trajectories as many as possible. We believe that the fish could not be adaptive enough to escape from chasing net with chaos motions that have many different chaos, since unpredictable chaotic motions of net may go beyond the fishes' adapting abilities to the net motions. In this report we introduce the chaos generating system by NNDE, which can produce many kinds of chaos theoretically, and then analyze the chaos with Lyapunov number, Poincare return map and initial value sensitivity.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119684","startPage":"2394","endPage":"2399","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119684.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple chaos generator by Neural-Network-Differential-Equation for intelligent fish-catching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Biology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aquaculture","CCD image sensors","chaos generators","differential equations","end effectors","manipulator dynamics","motion control","neurocontrollers","position control","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos generator","neural-network-differential-equation","intelligent fish-catching","fish continuous catching","fish release","fish-catching robot","robot hand","evolving mechanism","chaotic trajectory","chaos motion","net motion","Lyapunov number","Poincare return map","initial value sensitivity","robot dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119684/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiple chaos generator by Neural-Network-Differential-Equation for intelligent fish-catching","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6119684/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12538011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple chaos generator by Neural-Network-Differential-Equation for intelligent fish-catching","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"2394mf009571.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098451S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119684","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6119721,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Y\u00e9pez","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9","lastName":"Y\u00e9pez","id":"37265794300"},{"name":"Manel Velasco","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Manel","lastName":"Velasco","id":"37266090800"},{"name":"Pau Mart\u00ed","affiliation":["Automatic Control Department, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Pau","lastName":"Mart\u00ed","id":"37277828900"},{"name":"Enric X.

Consequently, event-driven control applied to Networked Control Systems (NCS) is a good approach for alleviating controllers bandwidth demands and reducing overall network traffic. Following this trend, this paper presents an execution rule for event-driven networked controllers that at each job execution aims at postponing the next job execution while applying an appropriated controller gain considering each varying sampling interval that applies at run time. This method permits to dynamically lower the generated traffic for each networked control loop while ensuring the same or better control performance than the achieved by the periodic case. In addition, an implementation strategy capable of dealing with network induced time delays is also presented. Simulation results illustrate the operation and benefits of the presented approach.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119721","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119721.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119721","startPage":"2606","endPage":"2611","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119721","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119721/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"One-step finite horizon boundary with varying control gain for event-driven Networked Control Systems","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6119721/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12538045","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-step finite horizon boundary with varying control gain for event-driven Networked Control Systems","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"2606mf020214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055897S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119721","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6119724,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Long Wang","affiliation":["Centre of Intelligent and Networked Systems, School of Information and Communication Technology, Central Queensland University, Rockhampton, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Yu-Long","lastName":"Wang","id":"37579402900"},{"name":"Qing-Long Han","affiliation":["Centre of Intelligent and Networked Systems, School of Information and Communication Technology, Central Queensland University, Rockhampton, QLD, Australia"],"firstName":"Qing-Long","lastName":"Han","id":"37274962400"},{"name":"Xinghuo Yu","affiliation":["Platform Technologies Research Institute, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Xinghuo","lastName":"Yu","id":"37280835100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-972-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-969-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-971-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"6119724","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Symmetric matrices","Stability criteria","Numerical stability","Design methodology","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","delays","Lyapunov methods","networked control systems","sampling methods","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stabilization","nonuniform sampling networked control system","controller design","continuous-time networked control systems","network-induced delay","packet dropout","sampling period","closed-loop model","Lyapunov functional","constant sampling period"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119724","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119724.pdf","startPage":"2624","endPage":"2629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stabilization of non-uniform sampling networked control systems","abstract":"This paper is concerned with controller design for continuous-time networked control systems (NCSs) under consideration of non-uniformly distributed time-varying sampling periods, network-induced delays and packet dropouts.

For this purpose, fault containment mechanisms have been developed as part of a Time-Triggered System-on-Chip (TTSoC) architecture. This paper experimentally evaluates the TTSoC architecture which comprises a time-triggered Network-on-a-Chip (NoC) and network interfaces serving as guardians.

Although it is sometimes applied as an open-loop technique, closed-loop control is mandatory in applications where homogeneous results are required, because the type, size, and geometry of the part being treated influence the process. The inherent non-repetitiveness of the technique makes it necessary a control of process parameters, such as laser power, fast and accurate enough according to the features of the melt pool. In a previous work, an FPGA-based measurement system was proposed to efficiently monitor the laser cladding process. This paper reports on the extension of that system to implement an enhanced control of the process, which allows the limitations of the PC-based solutions being currently used in industry to be overcome. Experimental results obtained in an industrial part reconstruction system using different part dimensions are presented, demonstrating the performance improvement achieved with regard to existing systems. The proposed solution can be applied to the treatment of small parts or complex geometries, for which the performance of PC-based systems is not good enough.","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119758.pdf","startPage":"2814","endPage":"2819","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance improvement of a laser cladding system through FPGA-based control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser beams","Control systems","Measurement by laser beam","Power lasers","Cameras","Field programmable gate arrays","Powders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cladding techniques","closed loop systems","field programmable gate arrays","laser materials processing","process control","programmable controllers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser cladding system","FPGA-based control","material processing technique","coating","rapid prototyping","open loop technique","closed loop control","process control","FPGA-based measurement system","process monitoring","industrial part reconstruction system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance improvement of a laser cladding system through FPGA-based control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6119758/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12538076","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance improvement of a laser cladding system through FPGA-based control","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"2814mf021504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105556S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6119760,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The idea is to replace ordinary capacitors of a three-level flying-capacitor inverter by three battery banks to alleviate power fluctuations in renewable generation. This approach eliminates the need for interfacing dc-dc converters and thus considerably improves the overall efficiency. However, the major problem with this approach is the uneven distribution of space vectors which is due to unavoidable unbalance in clamping voltages. A detailed analysis on the effects of this issue and a novel carrier based pulse width modulation method, which can generate undistorted currents even in the presence of unevenly distributed space vectors, are presented in this paper. A charge/discharge controller is also proposed for power sharing and state of charge balancing of battery banks. Simulation results are presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed system, modulation method and power sharing controller.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Inverters","Vectors","Barium","Switches","Modulation","Capacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","power capacitors","PWM invertors","renewable energy sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery clamped three-level inverter","renewable energy systems","battery direct integration scheme","three-level flying-capacitor inverter","power fluctuations","renewable generation","dc-dc converters","clamping voltages","carrier based pulse width modulation method","distributed space vectors","charge-discharge controller","state of charge balancing","battery banks","power sharing controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct Integration of battery energy storage systems","energy storage interfacing","unbalanced operation of flying-capacitor three-level inverters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119806","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119806.pdf","startPage":"3105","endPage":"3110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Battery clamped three-level inverter for renewable energy systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Battery clamped three-level inverter for renewable energy systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119806/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6119806/","accessionNumber":"12538117","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Battery clamped three-level inverter for renewable energy systems","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"3105mf011355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065222S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6119826,"authors":[{"name":"Tehseen Zia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of Sargodha, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Tehseen","lastName":"Zia","id":"37541404500"},{"name":"Dietmar Bruckner","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Technology, Vienna University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Dietmar","lastName":"Bruckner","id":"37409637200"},{"name":"Adeel Zaidi","affiliation":["Principal Engineer, Karachi Institute of Power Engineering, Karachi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Adeel","lastName":"Zaidi","id":"37541425500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-972-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-969-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-971-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"6119826","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":65,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1151},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Load modeling","Home appliances","Power demand","Data models","Steady-state","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","domestic appliances","hidden Markov models","load management","monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov model","household electric loads","automated energy management systems","decision making","remote monitoring","power consumption","appliance recognition"]}],"abstract":"In automated energy management systems, to make instantaneous decisions based on the appliance status information, continuous data access is a key requirement. With the advances in sensor and communication technologies, it is now possible to remotely monitor the power consumption data. However, before an appliance is actively monitored, it must be identified using the obtained power consumption data. Appropriate methods are required to analyse power consumption patterns for proper appliance recognition. The focus of this work is to provide the model structure for storing and distinguishing the recurring footprints of the household appliances. Hidden Markov model based method is proposed to recognize the individual appliances from combined load. It is found that the proposed method can efficiently differentiate the power consumption patterns of appliances from their combined profiles.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119826","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119826.pdf","startPage":"3218","endPage":"3223","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hidden Markov model based procedure for identifying household electric loads","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119826/","displayDocTitle":"A hidden Markov model based procedure for identifying household electric loads","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12537646","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6119826/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hidden Markov model based procedure for identifying household electric loads","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"3218mf014354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074148S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":6119831,"authors":[{"name":"Wencong Su","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6109934/6119266/6119831/6119831-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wencong Su (S'06) is currently working toward a Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at North Carolina State University.

The large penetration of these vehicles into the marketplace poses a potential threat to the existing power grid. A large number of PHEVs/ PEVs may cause serious system instability without a sophisticated control strategy. Energy storage is the key enabling technology for PHEVs/PEVs. The battery state information is critical to ensure optimal utilization of the available energy. It enables optimal control over the battery's charging and discharging process, thereby reducing the risk of overcharge or undercharge and prolonging battery life. In this paper, we first simulate real-world parking deck scenarios and implement four types of battery models (i.e., the linear model, relaxation model, hysteresis model, and combined model). We then evaluate optimal performance of the proposed large-scale PHEV/PEV charging algorithms under certain operating conditions. We characterize system performance and illustrate the importance of battery modeling to large-scale charging algorithms. The simulation results provide a general overview of the impact of battery modeling on optimal performance.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119831","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119831.pdf","startPage":"3248","endPage":"3253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119831","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119831","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119831/","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity analysis on battery modeling to large-scale PHEV/PEV charging algorithms","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12537651","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6119831/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity analysis on battery modeling to large-scale PHEV/PEV charging algorithms","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"3248mf002356.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066611S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6119853,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In this work we explore practical control algorithms that can achieve extreme precision motion tracking. The extreme precision is defined as the acquisition of tracking accuracy up to the hardware limit of a control system, for instance, the quantization limit of analog-digital converters (ADC). Sampled-data feedback control algorithms are unable to achieve such extreme precision tracking due to the inherent sampling delay that causes phase lag and limited control gain. In this paper we apply an iterative learning control (ILC) approach that can achieve the extreme precision for motion tracking tasks that repeat. ILC is essentially a feedforward control approach that fully utilizes the past control information, hence is able to overcome the limit of feedback algorithms. The sampled-data ILC is implemented on a piezoelectric positioning stage, in which the ADC device has a limited quantization of 49 nanometers. With only a few iterations of learning, the achieved tracking accuracy is 49 nanometers. Comparing with well tuned feedback control algorithm, ILC can further reduce the tracking error by 20 times.","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119854.pdf","startPage":"3376","endPage":"3381","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extreme precise motion tracking of piezoelectric positioning stage using sampled-data iterative learning control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Feedback control","Tracking","Resonant frequency","Adaptive control","Accuracy","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","delays","feedback","feedforward","iterative methods","learning systems","motion control","piezoelectric actuators","position control","quantisation (signal)","sampled data systems","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extreme precise motion tracking","piezoelectric positioning stage","sampled-data iterative learning control","piezoelectric stack actuators","tracking accuracy","control system","sampled-data feedback control algorithms","limited control gain","feed-forward control approach","analog-digital converters","quantization limit","sampling delay","phase lag"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Extreme precise motion tracking of piezoelectric positioning stage using sampled-data iterative learning control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6119854/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12537670","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extreme precise motion tracking of piezoelectric positioning stage using sampled-data iterative learning control","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"3376mf000795.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057011S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6119866,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The obtained results prove the efficiency of this approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of induction motor faults by an improved artificial ant clustering","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119866","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119866.pdf","startPage":"3446","endPage":"3451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Detection of induction motor faults by an improved artificial ant clustering","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6119866/","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12537681","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of induction motor faults by an improved artificial ant clustering","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"3446mf002275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07476S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6119872,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Hence, how to minimize the cogging torque so to reduce the torque ripple, and how to reduce the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the back EMF wave are important issues in the field of FSPMM. Four rotor topologies in this paper are proposed to suppress the cogging torque and make the back EMF more sinusoidal for an FSPMM with 12/14 (stator/rotor) poles so as to make it more suitable to the brushless AC (BLAC) operation. Plenty of theory analysis and quantitative comparisons are made between different schemes.

These systems can also be easily adapted to changing grid quality requirements. Volume and power losses of full scale converters become large increasing the rated power and for this reason an increase of power density and efficiency is desired. For this reason, an optimization is proposed in this paper in order to find convenient converter solutions dependent on the turbine power, number of modules, and switching frequency. Analytical, volume and power loss models are derived for the main converter components. Design and scaling laws are shown, which are used to evaluate the convenience of a converter solution. The optimization shows that semiconductors with lower blocking voltages lead to benefits in terms of both, power density and efficiency. A convenient increase of the rated voltage of the converter can be obtained using multilevel converters.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119899","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119899.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","startPage":"3634","endPage":"3639","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized design of two and three level full-scale voltage source converters for multi-MW wind power plants at different voltage levels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119899","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimized design of two and three level full-scale voltage source converters for multi-MW wind power plants at different voltage levels","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119899/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12537708","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6119899/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized design of two and three level full-scale voltage source converters for multi-MW wind power plants at different voltage levels","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"3634mf011762.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082099S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6119901,"authors":[{"name":"D.M.

Transient conditions like resistive load-shedding or sudden increase of constant power loads (CPL) might destabilize the whole system. Modeling and stability analysis of AC microgrids with CPLs have already been discussed in literature. However, no effective solutions are provided to stabilize this kind of system. Therefore, this paper proposes a virtual resistance based active damping method to eliminate constant power instability in AC microgrids. Advantages and limitations of the proposed method are also discussed in detail.

The design of the proposed MPPT is based on the direct-gradient descent method, and thus, it is referred as DG-MPPT-iless. It is aimed to have a rapid response on situations of rapid changes in irradiation and temperature. In the DG-MPPT-iless the information originally provided by the PV current sensor is reconstructed by estimators incorporated in the controller.

Both proposed designs have been implemented on a Xilinx low-cost Spartan-3 XC3S200 FPGA. When compared with existed methods, the results from the proposed designs show that our designs cost less FPGA slices while the same throughput can be obtained. The proposed architectures are designed to best suit for adding customizable security to embedded control systems.","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119963.pdf","startPage":"3998","endPage":"4002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119963","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based high-throughput and area-efficient architectures of the Hummingbird cryptography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based high-throughput and area-efficient architectures of the Hummingbird cryptography","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119963/","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6119963/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12537763","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based high-throughput and area-efficient architectures of the Hummingbird cryptography","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"3998mf019585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071433S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6119964,"authors":[{"name":"Amira Maalouf","affiliation":["Thales-AES, Chatou, France"],"firstName":"Amira","lastName":"Maalouf","id":"37410117400"},{"name":"Sandine Le Ballois","affiliation":["SATIE-IUP GEII, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Sandine","lastName":"Le Ballois","id":"37294464400"},{"name":"Eric Monmasson","affiliation":["SATIE-IUP GEII, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Monmasson","id":"37294192700"},{"name":"Jean-Yves Midy","affiliation":["Thales-AES, Chatou, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Yves","lastName":"Midy","id":"37394152600"},{"name":"Christophe Bruzy","affiliation":["Thales-AES, Chatou, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Bruzy","id":"38233978500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-972-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-969-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-971-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"6119964","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":428},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Generators","Estimation","Rotors","Stators","Sensorless control","Frequency synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft power systems","brushless machines","field programmable gate arrays","machine vector control","position control","sensorless machine control","starting","synchronous generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA","sensorless control","brushless synchronous starter generator","frequency signal injection","aircraft","electric start-up","position estimation","BSSG","machine vector control","aeronautic test bench","field programmable gate array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Brushless synchronous starter/generator (BSSG)","main starter/generator MSG","sensorless control","rotating high frequency signal injection"]}],"abstract":"The sensorless control of brushless synchronous starter generator (BSSG) that is widely used in the aeronautics domain is now considered a hot topic following to the success of the electric start-up of the main engine. Therefore, the focus of this paper is the position estimation of the BSSG during the electric start-up of the main engine at low speed and particularly at standstill. This is achieved by injecting a rotating high frequency voltage in the vector control scheme. The theoretical analysis is supported by experimental evidence obtained by using an aeronautic test bench. The sensorless algorithm is implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) in order to ensure fast computation with an execution time of a few microseconds. Numerous experimental results are given in order to illustrate the efficiency of the used FPGA-based solution at low speed and at standstill to achieve good performance sensorless control of the brushless synchronous starter generator.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2011.6119964","publicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2011 - 37th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/6109934/6119266/06119964.pdf","startPage":"4003","endPage":"4008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2011.6119964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119266","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based sensorless control of brushless synchronous starter generator at standstill and low speed using high frequency signal injection for an aircraft application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6119964/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based sensorless control of brushless synchronous starter generator at standstill and low speed using high frequency signal injection for an aircraft application","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6119964/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","conferenceDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12537764","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based sensorless control of brushless synchronous starter generator at standstill and low speed using high frequency signal injection for an aircraft application","confLoc":"Melbourne, VIC, Australia","sourcePdf":"4003mf020494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061471S","chronDate":"7-10 Nov. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6109934","isNumber":"6119266","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6109934","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6119266","articleId":"6119964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6119965,"authors":[{"name":"Bogdan Alecsa","affiliation":["Automatic Control and Applied Informatics Department, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Bogdan","lastName":"Alecsa","id":"37601319300"},{"name":"Marcian Cirstea","affiliation":["Computing and Technology Department, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Marcian","lastName":"Cirstea","id":"37294710200"},{"name":"Alexandru Onea","affiliation":["Automatic Control and Applied Informatics Department, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania"],"firstName":"Alexandru","lastName":"Onea","id":"37601325400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-972-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-969-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-971-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"},{"format":"CD","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"6119965","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6119965","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Mathematical model","Rotors","Stators","Generators","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital control","discrete time systems","field programmable gate arrays","permanent magnet motors","sensors","synchronous motors","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["holistic modeling","PMSM speed controller","digital controller","permanent magnet synchronous motor speed controller","Matlab-Simulink environment","system generator block","FPGA hardware","sensor interface"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a holistic approach to modeling and FPGA implementation of digital controllers. The case study of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) speed controller is considered. The whole system is modeled in the Matlab Simulink environment. The controller is then translated to discrete time and remodeled using System Generator blocks, directly synthesizable into FPGA hardware. The algorithm is further refined and factorized to fit into a low cost FPGA, without significantly increasing the execution time. The resulting controller is then integrated together with sensor interfaces and analysis tools and implemented into an FPGA device.
