Even though Murphy's Law is applied everywhere in reality, a good planning algorithm will assist the designers to be aware of the short plates of their design and to improve them before the problems being exposed at the real deployment. A 3D multi-objective planning algorithm is proposed in this paper to provide solutions on the locations of nodes and their properties. It employs a developed ray-tracing scheme for sensing signal and radio propagation modelling. Therefore it is sensitive to the obstacles and makes the models of sensing coverage and link quality more practical compared with other heuristics that use ideal unit-disk models. The proposed algorithm aims at reaching an overall optimization on hardware cost, coverage, link quality and lifetime. Thus each of those metrics are modelled and normalized to compose a desirability function. Evolutionary algorithm is designed to efficiently tackle this NP-hard multi-objective optimization problem. The proposed algorithm is applicable for both indoor and outdoor 3D scenarios. Different parameters that affect the performance are analyzed through extensive experiments; two state-of-the-art algorithms are rebuilt and tested with the same configuration as that of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm converges efficiently within 600 iterations and performs better than the compared heuristics.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2013.6700019","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683943/6699103/06700019.pdf","startPage":"5428","endPage":"5433","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","publicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2013.6700019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6699103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 3D multi-objective optimization planning algorithm for wireless sensor networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6700019/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A 3D multi-objective optimization planning algorithm for wireless sensor networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14003911","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6700019/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 3D multi-objective optimization planning algorithm for wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"5428vf042803.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050589S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683943","isNumber":"6699103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683943","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6699103","articleId":"6700019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6700044,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Wolkiewicz","affiliation":["Drives and Measurements, Institute of Electrical Machines, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Wolkiewicz","id":"37567489800"},{"name":"Czeslaw T.

A key feature of this system is the ability to gather and store information from various networking and monitoring devices from within the same computing cluster. Another key feature is the ability to intelligently control VMWare vSphere local instances based on analysis of collected data and predefined parameters. vSphere in turn, once it receives commands from the AMDS, proceeds to issue instructions to multiple locally monitored ESXi severs in order to maximize energy efficiency, reduce the carbon footprint and minimize running costs. The predefined parameters are based on results from a previous paper written by the authors. The AMDS has been deployed on the authors' test bed and is currently running successfully.

In the state-space formalism, standard control textbooks suggest that a simple approach to model discrete-time LTI systems with time delay shorter or equal than the sampling period is to extend the state vector with a new state variable representing the last control signal, which implies increasing the order of the model by one. In this paper an alternative state-space model for discrete-time LTI systems with time delay is introduced that does not require increasing the order of the model.

This bridges the gap between the two communities working on droop control and PLLs. As a result, droop controllers and PLLs can be improved and further developed via adopting the advancements in the other community. This also offers insightful understanding to power systems that have inverters and generators mixed together and leads to significant technological breakthrough for the grid connection of renewable energy.

The controller is trained in online mode. The adaptation algorithm takes into account repetitiveness of the process to be controlled. The cost function evaluates performance of the controller over the whole period of the reference signal and the weights are updated only once per period of this signal. A model-free concept is implemented and hence no prior identification of the plant is needed. The controller employs the backpropagation algorithm for updating its weights in order to adapt to changing load conditions. The controller is nonlinear and the tuning procedure involves determining a good set of values for at least three parameters: a number of neurons, an error gain and an output gain. In our recent publication devoted to the development of the control algorithm we relied on guessing and checking at the tuning stage. Here the particle swarm optimizer (PSO) is used to find the optimal set of values for these parameters. The gradientless search algorithm enables a designer to work with any user-defined performance index that reflects desired system behavior. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with the help of numerical experiments. The controller tuned by the PSO is capable to maintain a high-quality output voltage waveform in the presence of the periodic disturbance caused by nonlinear loads.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2013.6700120","startPage":"6003","endPage":"6009","publicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2013.6700120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6699103","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683943/6699103/06700120.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimization of an online trained repetitive neurocontroller for the sine-wave inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6700120/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization of an online trained repetitive neurocontroller for the sine-wave inverter","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6700120/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14004055","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization of an online trained repetitive neurocontroller for the sine-wave inverter","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"6003vf024619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066795S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683943","isNumber":"6699103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683943","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6699103","articleId":"6700120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6700133,"authors":[{"name":"Hongming Yang","affiliation":["Philips Research, High Tech Campus, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Hongming","lastName":"Yang","id":"37309301800"},{"name":"Ashish Pandharipande","affiliation":["Philips Research, High Tech Campus, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ashish","lastName":"Pandharipande","id":"37266388400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0224-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"6700133","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":571},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Bit error rate","Receivers","Light emitting diodes","Interference","Optical transmitters","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","decode and forward communication","error statistics","light emitting diodes","optical communication","photodiodes","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["full-duplex relay VLC","LED lighting","linear system topology","visible light communications","light emitting diodes","photodiodes","reliable communications","amplify-and-forward processing","decode-and-forward processing","relay luminaire","bit error rate","BER"]}],"abstract":"Visible light communications (VLC) with light emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodiodes enables a wide range of applications in LED lighting systems. One of the main challenges in VLC is the limited range of reliable communications, owing mainly to the non-coherent nature of optical communications and limited output power of LED luminaires. In order to enhance VLC range without compromising the network throughput, we consider full-duplex relay VLC. Specifically, we consider a basic 3-luminaire (source, relay and destination) linear system topology under amplify-and-forward and decode-and-forward processing at the relay luminaire. Due to full-duplex operation at the relay luminaire, a self-interference signal component arises and is subsequently canceled out as part of the relay processing. We analyze the system performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) and show that multiple orders of magnitude improvement in BER is achieved as compared to direct link VLC under practical indoor conditions.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2013.6700133","publicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683943/6699103/06700133.pdf","startPage":"6075","endPage":"6080","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2013.6700133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6699103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full-duplex relay VLC in LED lighting linear system topology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6700133","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6700133/","displayDocTitle":"Full-duplex relay VLC in LED lighting linear system topology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14004263","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6700133/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-duplex relay VLC in LED lighting linear system topology","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"6075vf021318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045655S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683943","isNumber":"6699103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683943","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6699103","articleId":"6700133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6700157,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco Umbr\u00eda","affiliation":["Higher Technical School of Engineering, University of Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Umbr\u00eda","id":"37398107300"},{"name":"Francisco Gordillo","affiliation":["Higher Technical School of Engineering, University of Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Gordillo","id":"37299539200"},{"name":"Francisco Salas","affiliation":["Higher Technical School of Engineering, University of Seville, Spain"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Salas","id":"37421866800"},{"name":"Sergio V\u00e1zquez","affiliation":["Universidad de Sevilla, Sevilla, Andaluc\u00c3\u00ada, ES"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"V\u00e1zquez","id":"37293845300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0224-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"6700157","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Capacitors","Modulation","Voltage control","Switches","Reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase three-level neutral-point-clamped converters","duty cycles","gate pulses","power switches","power electronic converters","control input saturation effects","direct power control strategy","indirect control","space vector modulation technique","discrete set","gating signals","switching sequence","PSCAD environment"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6700157","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2013.6700157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2013.6700157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6699103","publicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683943/6699103/06700157.pdf","startPage":"6213","endPage":"6218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct power control of three-phase three-level neutral-point-clamped converters with control input saturation","abstract":"The phenomenon of control input saturation due to limitations in the duty cycles of the gate pulses of the power switches is an important issue in the performance of power electronic converters. This paper formulates and analyzes the control input saturation effects in a three-phase three-level neutral-point-clamped converter connected to the grid. Particularly, the phenomenon is studied when a direct power control strategy is implemented as an indirect control through a space vector modulation technique. The discrete set of values of the gating signals defines the power converter control region. Due to the modulation strategy, which is introduced to generate the switching sequence, any point located inside the control region is physically implementable. However, the points situated out of this area can not be generated because they represent duty cycles higher than 100%, leading to a saturation scenario. In this paper, several strategies are studied in order to cope with the saturation problem and obtain the final gating signals.

Several Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Plug-in Hybrid EVs are currently on the market offering a clean and environment friendly alternative to conventional vehicles. However, limited mileage capacity and long refueling times have lead to a lukewarm reception from the consumers. In order to reduce the charging time fast charging architectures are being developed, usually as off-board solutions located in public installations. This paper presents a centralized charging station architecture, using a bipolar dc grid to power off-board chargers and integrate of DGs and storage systems. The central converter topology is an NPC and a novel balancing technique is implemented to extend the operating range of the power converter.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6699103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2013.6700158","publicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683943/6699103/06700158.pdf","startPage":"6219","endPage":"6226","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2013.6700158","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electric vehicle charging station using a neutral point clamped converter with bipolar DC bus and voltage balancing circuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Electric vehicle charging station using a neutral point clamped converter with bipolar DC bus and voltage balancing circuit","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6700158/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14004078","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6700158/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electric vehicle charging station using a neutral point clamped converter with bipolar DC bus and voltage balancing circuit","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"6219vf041629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055728S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683943","isNumber":"6699103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683943","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6699103","articleId":"6700158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6700159,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The CMOS IC NN outputs the driving pulses using synchronization phenomena such as biological neural networks. The driving pulses can operate the actuators of the biomimetics micro robot directly. Therefore, the CMOS IC NN realized the robot control without using any software programs or A/D converters. The micro robot emulated the locomotion method and the neural networks of an insect with rotary type actuators, link mechanisms and CMOS IC NN.

Recursive least-square approach is applied to estimate the elasticity of samples using the information of the previous surface topography.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2013.6700200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2013.6700200","startPage":"6460","endPage":"6465","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683943/6699103/06700200.pdf","publicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6699103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elasticity estimation for sample by AFM utilizing previous line sample surface topography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Elasticity estimation for sample by AFM utilizing previous line sample surface topography","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6700200/","accessionNumber":"14004261","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6700200/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elasticity estimation for sample by AFM utilizing previous line sample surface topography","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"6460vf029874.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042785S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683943","isNumber":"6699103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683943","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6699103","articleId":"6700200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6700255,"authors":[{"name":"Rocco Restaino","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Salerno, Fisciano, SA, Italy"],"firstName":"Rocco","lastName":"Restaino","id":"37266721100"},{"name":"Walter Zamboni","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Salerno, Fisciano, SA, Italy"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Zamboni","id":"37294108800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0224-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"6700255","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Batteries","Equations","System-on-chip","Estimation","Joints","Hysteresis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery charge measurement","battery management systems","Bayes methods","hybrid electric vehicles","Monte Carlo methods","parameter estimation","particle filtering (numerical methods)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rao Blackwellised particle filter","battery state of charge","parameters online estimation","battery management systems","hybrid electric vehicles applications","model based approaches","simultaneous sequential Bayesian estimation","Monte Carlo implementations","joint estimation"]}],"abstract":"State-of-charge and parameters online estimation is one of the key features of battery management systems for hybrid-electric vehicles applications.

Dedicated short range communication (DSRC) being designed exclusively for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication is one of the major candidates to enable such services. The focus of this paper is to shed light on the integration aspects of this technology, especially in regards to the antenna design. A methodology is presented to overcome the difficulties occurring from the integration of the antenna in the radome on the vehicle rooftop. With help of simulations and measurements it is illustrated how the conventionally unwanted dielectric lens effect of the antenna radome resulting in nulls in the radiation pattern can be used to deliberately increase the antenna performance. The performance enhancement by using the antenna radome as a dielectric lens is validated with four prototypes in a semi-anechoic chamber. It is moreover shown that simplified geometrical shapes such as cuboids can be used to describe efficiently the behavior of geometrical more complex radome designs. The greatest advantage of our proposed methodology to enhance antenna performance is that it can be employed without changes of any electronic control units. Thus it can easily be included in a running production cycle without even altering any design elements of the vehicle. To demonstrate to which degree the achieved enhancement on component level translates into system level we also present simulation results of a test scenario including a vehicle and a road-side unit. The outcome of the system level simulations shows substantial improvements in the received signal strength (RSS).","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683943/6699103/06700272.pdf","startPage":"6880","endPage":"6884","publicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2013.6700272","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2013.6700272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6699103","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6700272","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of vehicle-specific antenna radome effects at 5.9 GHz","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Antenna radiation patterns","Dielectrics","Vehicles","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anechoic chambers (electromagnetic)","antenna radiation patterns","intelligent transportation systems","microwave antennas","radio access networks","radomes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle-specific antenna radome effects","multiple radio access technology","traffic information services","intelligent transportation systems","ITS","dedicated short range communication","DSRC","vehicle-to-vehicle communication","V2V communication","vehicle-to-infrastructure communication","V2I communication","radome antenna","radiation pattern","dielectric lens","semianechoic chamber","antenna performance","electronic control units","system level simulations","received signal strength","RSS","frequency 5.9 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DSRC","ITS-G5","802.11p","V2V","V2I","Automotive Antennas","Antenna Radome","Dielectric lens"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6700272/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of vehicle-specific antenna radome effects at 5.9 GHz","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6700272/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14003732","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of vehicle-specific antenna radome effects at 5.9 GHz","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"6880vf027049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061568S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683943","isNumber":"6699103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683943","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6699103","articleId":"6700272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6700274,"authors":[{"name":"Erik G.

Nevertheless, the rise of DC output sources such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, fuel cells, and distributed batteries leads to the immediate need for DC MGs. In this paper, a hierarchical control strategy for a droop-controlled DC MG is proposed, which fits the smart house infrastructure to adopt online renewable generation and load sharing. The improved control strategies combined with the hierarchical approach includes three loops of controllers: the primary control, the secondary control, and the tertiary control. The issues of internal current limiter and anti-windup are also discussed in this study. The simulation results of the proposed approach are presented to verify the feasibility, and the experimental results are carried out to evaluate the droop concept and secondary voltage compensation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6700316/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6700316/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14021561","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A practical load sharing control strategy for DC microgrids and DC supplied houses","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical load sharing control strategy for DC microgrids and DC supplied houses","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"7124vf020451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077943S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683943","isNumber":"6699103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683943","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6699103","articleId":"6700316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6700317,"authors":[{"name":"Byoung-Woong An","affiliation":["Dept. of Control & Instrumentation Eng., Korea Nat'l University of Transportation, Chungbuk, Korea"],"lastName":"Byoung-Woong An","id":"37087712814"},{"name":"Hag-Wone Kim","affiliation":["Dept. of Control & Instrumentation Eng., Korea Nat'l University of Transportation, Chungbuk, Korea"],"lastName":"Hag-Wone Kim","id":"37087192463"},{"name":"Kwan-Yuhl Cho","affiliation":["Dept. of Control & Instrumentation Eng., Korea Nat'l University of Transportation, Chungbuk, Korea"],"lastName":"Kwan-Yuhl Cho","id":"37087193177"},{"name":"Byung-Moon Han","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Eng., Myongji University, Gyeonggi, Korea"],"lastName":"Byung-Moon Han","id":"37087173860"},{"name":"Gyo-Bum Chung","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic & Electrical Eng., Hongik University, Sejong-si, Korea"],"lastName":"Gyo-Bum Chung","id":"37087687147"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0224-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"6700317","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":487},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6700317","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Power harmonic filters","Capacitors","Inverters","Mathematical model","Pulse width modulation","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","damping","electric current control","feedforward","LC circuits","model reference adaptive control systems","observers","power grids","PWM invertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three phase PWM inverter","sensorless active damping method","grid-connected LCL filter","resonance component","simple MRAS observer","model reference adaptive system","feedforward compensation","observed capacitor voltage sensor","current controller"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SVPWM Inverter","Active damping","MRAS(Model Reference Adaptive System) Observer","LCL filter"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, new sensorless active damping method of the grid-connected LCL filter for a three-phase PWM inverter is proposed.

They allow clean electric energy to be utilized in transportation and reduce pollution in the urban environment. Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) can be utilized in EVs and these comprise of batteries and ultracapacitors. They allow for the full use of both the high energy density characteristic of the batteries and the high power density performance of the ultracapacitors to achieve a satisfying driving range while meeting transient power demands at an acceptable manufacturing cost. In this paper, component sizing is investigated as an optimization problem with the aim of minimizing the cost of the energy storage system. The problem is solved using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for an example EV. In the implementation of the GA, the driving performance requirements are set as the constraints and formulated with penalty functions. This is because the GA is not appropriate for constrained optimization problems. In order to enhance the robustness of the sizing, three different driving cycles are incorporated into the optimization process. They are the NEDC, UDDS and CHINACITY cycles. The result is obtained and the effectiveness and reliability of the GA are further verified by implementing another optimization using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2013.6700352","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683943/6699103/06700352.pdf","startPage":"7331","endPage":"7336","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","publicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2013.6700352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6699103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic Algorithm based optimal component sizing for an electric vehicle","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6700352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithm based optimal component sizing for an electric vehicle","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14016171","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6700352/","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithm based optimal component sizing for an electric vehicle","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"7331vf021903.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063576S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683943","isNumber":"6699103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683943","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6699103","articleId":"6700352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6700370,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Dias Ferreira","affiliation":["EPS Group, Kungliga Tekniska Hogskolan, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o Dias","lastName":"Ferreira","id":"37080317900"},{"name":"Luis Ribeiro","affiliation":["Dep. de Eng.

As a matter of fact, the occurrence of faults in PEMFC and power converters has undesirable effects on the whole power train such as decreasing of the efficiency and lifetime of the components (PEMFC, converters). The purpose of this paper is to present a fault diagnosis method for PEMFC and DC/DC converter. This fault diagnosis is based on neural networks (NNs) modeling approach combined to numerical simulation in which a new developed sensitive model of PEMFC and an interleaved DC/DC converter have been especially used. Specifically, in this study drying and flooding faults that usually occured in PEMFC according to operations condition variation such as temperatue, humidity and pressure have been considered. Moreover, the power semiconductor failures in DC/DC converter have been taken into consideration in this study.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6700503/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14016128","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6700503/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Faults diagnosis between PEM fuel cell and DC/DC converter using neural networks for automotive applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Faults diagnosis between PEM fuel cell and DC/DC converter using neural networks for automotive applications","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"8186vf037974.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064182S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683943","isNumber":"6699103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683943","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6699103","articleId":"6700503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":6700510,"authors":[{"name":"V\u00e1clav \u0160m\u00eddl","affiliation":["Regional Innovation Centre for Electrical Engineering, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"V\u00e1clav","lastName":"\u0160m\u00eddl","id":"37293780800"},{"name":"Robert Nedv\u011bd","affiliation":["Regional Innovation Centre for Electrical Engineering, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Nedv\u011bd","id":"37086731132"},{"name":"Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ko\u0161an","affiliation":["Regional Innovation Centre for Electrical Engineering, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Tom\u00e1\u0161","lastName":"Ko\u0161an","id":"38546912900"},{"name":"Zden\u011bk Peroutka","affiliation":["Regional Innovation Centre for Electrical Engineering, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Zden\u011bk","lastName":"Peroutka","id":"37271624200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0224-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1553-572X"}],"articleNumber":"6700510","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of marginalized particle filter for sensorless control of PMSM drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6700510","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Field programmable gate arrays","Digital signal processing","Mathematical model","Kalman filters","Sensorless control","Pipelines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","Kalman filters","particle filtering (numerical methods)","permanent magnet motors","rotors","sensorless machine control","stochastic processes","synchronous motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["marginalized particle filter","sensorless control algorithm","MPF estimator","drive control","DSP implementation","pipelining","field programmable logic array","PMSM drive","rotor position estimation","non-Gaussianity","Kalman filter","stochastic filter","sensorless control","FPGA implementation"]}],"abstract":"Marginalized particle filter is a stochastic filter combining Kalman filters with particle filters. It decomposes the model into linear and nonlinear part and applies the Kalman filter for the former and the particle filter for the latter. In effect, this allows to represent accurately the inherent non-Gaussianity and nonlinearity of the model. This allows estimation of the rotor position of the PMSM drive in the full speed range, including the standstill. The main disadvantage is its high computational cost. In this paper, we present an implementation of the marginalized particle filter in the field programmable logic array (FPGA). The parallel nature of the MPF algorithm allows to use pipelining which yields speedup in the order of magnitude in comparison to the DSP implementation. The sensorless control of the drive is implemented on a board with both DSP and FPGA, where the drive control runs on the DSP and the MPF estimator in the FPGA. Execution time of the estimator is thus negligible in the execution time of the sensorless control. Performance of the resulting sensorless control algorithm is evaluated on a developed drive prototype of rated power of 10.7kW.","doi":"10.1109/IECON.2013.6700510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IECON.2013.6700510","publicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","displayPublicationTitle":"IECON 2013 - 39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683943/6699103/06700510.pdf","startPage":"8227","endPage":"8232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6699103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6700510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of marginalized particle filter for sensorless control of PMSM drives","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14016043","htmlLink":"/document/6700510/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of marginalized particle filter for sensorless control of PMSM drives","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"8227vf036471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075773S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683943","isNumber":"6699103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683943","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6699103","articleId":"6700510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6700543,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The number of required power electronic switches against required voltage levels is a very important factor in designing of multilevel converter, because switches define the reliability, circuit size, cost, installation area, and control complexity. For asymmetric and cascade converter, new algorithms for determination of dc voltage sources values are presented. To produce maximum number of levels at the output voltage, the proposed cascade topology is optimized for different goals, such as the minimization of the number of power electronic switches, gate driver circuits, power diodes, dc voltage sources, and blocking voltage on switches. Comparison of the results of various multilevel converters will be investigated to reflect the merits of the presented topologies. The operations of the proposed multilevel converters have been analyzed with the experimental and simulation results for different topologies. Verification of the analytical results is done using MATLAB simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial

Tactile sensing experiments demonstrate the ability to infer the abstract geometries and motions of objects imparting force on the sensor surface by analyzing microchannel deformation patterns.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6766215/06701139.pdf","startPage":"1443","endPage":"1452","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2297380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2297380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6766215","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft Tactile Sensor Arrays for Force Feedback in Micromanipulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microchannel","Sensor arrays","Tactile sensors","Sensitivity","Mechanical sensors","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force feedback","mechanical testing","micromanipulators","tactile sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft tactile sensor arrays","force feedback","micromanipulation","submillimeter contact localization","contact force measurement","conductive liquid microchannels","mechanical testing","numerically optimized sensor prototype","submillimeter contact localization resolution","tactile sensing experiments","microchannel deformation patterns"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Haptic feedback","micromanipulation","numerical design optimization","force feedback","soft sensors","tactile sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Soft Tactile Sensor Arrays for Force Feedback in Micromanipulation","volume":"14","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6701139/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14156883","dateOfInsertion":"12 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft Tactile Sensor Arrays for Force Feedback in Micromanipulation","sourcePdf":"jsen-hammond-2297380-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097533S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6766215","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6766215","articleId":"6701139","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701141,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6809870/6701141/shen-2297301-small.gif","p":["\nKe Shen (S'10) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in\nelectrical engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, where he\nis currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering.","From 2011 to 2012, he was with the Center for Ultra-Wide-Area Resilient Electric Energy Transmission Networks\n(CURENT), University of Tennessee, Knoxville, as a Visiting Ph.D. Student, supported by the Chinese Scholarship Council.\nHis current research interests include power electronics for renewable energy sources, multilevel converter, and energy\nconversion."]},"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Shen","id":"37407767100"},{"name":"Dan Zhao","affiliation":["Centre for Applied R&D, Monolithic Power Systems, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6809870/6701141/zhao-2297301-small.gif","p":["\nDan Zhao received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering\nfrom the Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China, in 2009 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the\nHarbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2011.","Since 2011, she has been with the Centre for Applied R&D, Monolithic Power Systems Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China, as\nan Application Engineer in the AC/DC Power Department.

To reduce switching losses and device stress, the staircase modulation method has been adopted in high-voltage and high-power energy conversion applications. In particular, the selection of the appropriate iterative initial values of switching angles is a significant step to realize a staircase modulated MMC. The proposed method is able to find the optimum initial values of switching angles, while it has the advantages of global optimization and quadratic convergence, which benefit from the PSO algorithm and Newton method, respectively. The paper presents analytical discussion of the voltage balancing control approach with rotation of switching angles. The main benefit of the efficient switching patterns is that the MMC has lower switching losses and minimum dV/dt stress. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the practical feasibility of the proposed scheme for the MMC.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14267308","htmlLink":"/document/6701141/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"10","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Elimination of Harmonics in a Modular Multilevel Converter Using Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Staircase Modulation Strategy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elimination of Harmonics in a Modular Multilevel Converter Using Particle Swarm Optimization-Based Staircase Modulation Strategy","sourcePdf":"tie-shen-2297301-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107759S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6809870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6809870","articleId":"6701141","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701148,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Kang","affiliation":["Electronic and Information Engineering Department, University of Beihang, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Kang","id":"38238916200"},{"name":"Erya Deng","affiliation":["IEF, University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Erya","lastName":"Deng","id":"37072694400"},{"name":"Jacques-Olivier Klein","affiliation":["IEF, University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Jacques-Olivier","lastName":"Klein","id":"37276514100"},{"name":"Yue Zhang","affiliation":["IEF, University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086545102"},{"name":"Youguang Zhang","affiliation":["Electronic and Information Engineering Department, University of Beihang, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Youguang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086214193"},{"name":"Claude Chappert","affiliation":["IEF, University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Chappert","id":"37315626200"},{"name":"Dafin\u00e9 Ravelosona","affiliation":["IEF, University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Dafin\u00e9","lastName":"Ravelosona","id":"37316339500"},{"name":"Weisheng Zhao","affiliation":["IEF, University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, France"],"firstName":"Weisheng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37536930400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9464"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0069"}],"articleNumber":"6701148","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":809},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Magnetics Society","url":"http://www.ieeemagnetics.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701148","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Magnetic tunneling","CMOS integrated circuits","Integrated circuit reliability","Logic circuits","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","CMOS logic circuits","integrated circuit modelling","magnetic tunnelling","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["separated precharge sensing amplifier","deep submicrometer MTJ-CMOS hybrid logic circuits","magnetic tunnel junction","nonvolatile memory circuit","Moore's law","hybrid MTJ-CMOS structure","MTJ electric signals","CMOS electronics","deep submicrometer technology nodes","supply voltage","process variations","discharging stage","evaluation stage","sensing operation","process variation effects","technology scales","sensing reliability","transient statistical simulation","Monte-Carlo statistical simulation"]},{"kwd":["High reliability","magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ)","nonvolatile","process variation","sensing amplifier"]}],"abstract":"Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) embedded in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) has been considered as one of the potentially powerful solutions to build up nonvolatile memory and logic circuits. It possesses many intrinsic merits, such as high speed, instant on/off, good scalability and low-leakage power, and promises to extend the Moore's law. A critical issue in this hybrid MTJ/CMOS structure is the reliable integration of MTJ electric signals to CMOS electronics, especially for the deep submicrometer technology nodes (e.g., 28 nm) in presence of low supply voltage and serious process variations. In this paper, we propose a new sensing amplifier, named separated precharge sense amplifier. This circuit, by separating the discharging and evaluation stages of the sensing operation, can operate at a lower supply voltage (<;1.0 V) and reduces the effects of process variations as technology scales, thereby providing higher sensing reliability compared with the previously proposed solutions while preserving the high-speed and low-power consumption.

Because it is infeasible to employ a common control channel in a licensed spectrum, blind rendezvous is an expected solution and generally estimated by the criteria of asynchronous rendezvous support, guaranteed rendezvous, asymmetric model support, heterogeneity of roles, and short time-to-rendezvous (TTR). Most existing blind rendezvous methods fail to fully satisfy these criteria or have considerable TTR significantly increased with the number of channels. This paper presents a new alternate hop-and-wait channel hopping method, called E-AHW, which can support fast blind rendezvous. By assigning each secondary user a unique alternate channel hopping sequence composed of HOP/WAIT-mode subsequences, all blind rendezvous criteria can be satisfied with shorter TTR. According to simulation results, the performance of E-AHW is better than existing methods. Moreover, using E-AHW, the average value and standard deviation of time intervals between two rendezvous are also less than other methods. Thus, E-AHW can provide an efficient and stable communication environment.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2014","accessionNumber":"14560913","htmlLink":"/document/6701149/","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Blind Rendezvous Method by Alternate Hop-and-Wait Channel Hopping in Cognitive Radio Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Blind Rendezvous Method by Alternate Hop-and-Wait Channel Hopping in Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-chuang-2297313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082461S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6887382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6887382","articleId":"6701149","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701150,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqiang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6809870/6701150/zwang-2297304-small.gif","p":["\nZhiqiang Wang (S'11) received the B.S. degree in electrical\nengineering from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2007 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang\nUniversity, Hangzhou, China, in 2010.

Second, the desaturation technique using a sensing diode to detect the drain-source voltage under overcurrent faults is implemented as well. Third, a novel active overcurrent protection scheme through dynamic evaluation of fault current level is proposed. The design considerations and potential issues of the protection methods are described and analyzed in detail.

Many research works for LTE-A systems with carrier aggregation configuration have concentrated on the radio resource management problem for downlink transmission, including mainly CC assignment and packet scheduling. Most previous studies have not considered that the assigned CCs in each UE can be changed. Furthermore, they also have not considered the modulation and coding scheme constraint, as specified in LTE-A standards. Therefore, their proposed schemes may limit the radio resource usage and are not compatible with LTE-A systems. In this paper, we assume that the scheduler can reassign CCs to each UE at each transmission time interval and formulate the downlink radio resource scheduling problem under the modulation and coding scheme constraint, which is proved to be NP-hard. Then, a novel greedy-based scheme is proposed to maximize the system throughput while maintaining proportional fairness of radio resource allocation among all UEs. We show that this scheme can guarantee at least half of the performance of the optimal solution. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the schemes in previous studies.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2013.2297310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/6887382/06701154.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2013.2297310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6887382","startPage":"2229","endPage":"2239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Downlink Radio Resource Allocation with Carrier Aggregation in LTE-Advanced Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Downlink Radio Resource Allocation with Carrier Aggregation in LTE-Advanced Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701154/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14560914","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6701154/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Downlink Radio Resource Allocation with Carrier Aggregation in LTE-Advanced Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-chen-2297310-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07287S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"6887382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6887382","articleId":"6701154","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701167,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Qiu","affiliation":["ATR Laboratory, College of Electronics Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6819879/6701167/qiu-2295162-small.gif","p":["\nWei Qiu received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering and the M.S.\ndegree in information and communication engineering from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China,\nin 2008 and 2010, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include radar signal processing and radar imaging."]},"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37594457600"},{"name":"Hongzhong Zhao","affiliation":["ATR Laboratory, College of Electronics Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6819879/6701167/zhao-2295162-small.gif","p":["\nHongzhong Zhao (M'06) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering\nand the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in information and telecommunication systems from the National University of Defense\nTechnology, Changsha, China, in 1993, 1999, and 2003, respectively.","He is currently a Professor with the National University of Defense Technology.

In this paper, a novel fully polarimetric ISAR imaging method based on CS is proposed. First, a definition of joint sparsity is given by exploiting the scattering characteristics of a target in fully polarimetric channels. Then, fully polarimetric ISAR images are constructed by means of the sparse recovery algorithm under the constraint of the joint sparsity. This proposed imaging method combines the merits of a full-polarization technique and CS theory, and hence, it has two main advantages: it can provide high-resolution ISAR images with limited measurements, which is a promising technique for reducing data storage; it generates fully polarimetric ISAR images with the number and the positions of the scattering centers aligned in polarimetric channels, which allows for further polarimetric scattering characteristic analysis. Finally, both simulation and experimental results are shown to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/6819879/06701167.pdf","startPage":"6119","endPage":"6131","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2013.2295162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2013.2295162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819879","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Resolution Fully Polarimetric ISAR Imaging Based on Compressive Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar imaging","Imaging","Scattering","Sensors","Radar polarimetry","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image resolution","radar imaging","radar polarimetry","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-resolution fully polarimetric ISAR imaging","compressive sensing","2D range-cross-range radar imaging","scattering center","inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging","polarimetric channel","sparse recovery algorithm","full-polarization technique","CS theory","data storage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing (CS)","inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging","joint sparsity","polarimetric radar"]},{"kwd":["Compressive sensing (CS)","inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging","joint sparsity","polarimetric radar"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"High-Resolution Fully Polarimetric ISAR Imaging Based on Compressive Sensing","volume":"52","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6701167/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14331741","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Resolution Fully Polarimetric ISAR Imaging Based on Compressive Sensing","sourcePdf":"tgrs-qiu-2295162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168513S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6819879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6819879","articleId":"6701167","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701169,"authors":[{"name":"Yongle Wu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6809870/6701169/wu-2297299-small.gif","p":["\nYongle Wu received the B.Eng. degree in communication\nengineering and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications\n(BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2006 and 2011, respectively.","From April to October 2010, he was a Research Assistant with the City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

By using an external frequency-dependent impedance transformer, a novel dual-band branch-line coupler is obtained with a detailed analytical design method. For ease of design, maximum power-dividing ratio with varying frequency ratio for different terminated impedance values is provided. Owing to the additional design freedom, the calculation of parameters becomes much more flexible. Finally, for experimental validation and convenient measurement, a dual-band unequal microstrip branch-line coupler with four standard ports is designed, fabricated, and measured. Good agreement between the simulated and measured results can be observed.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6809870/06701169.pdf","startPage":"5509","endPage":"5516","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2297299","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2297299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701169","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytical Design Method for a Novel Dual-Band Unequal Coupler With Four Arbitrary Terminated Resistances","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplers","Dual band","Impedance","Equations","Educational institutions","Design methodology","Government"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric resistance","impedance convertors","microstrip couplers","power dividers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analytical design method","dual-band unequal coupler","arbitrary terminated resistances","dual-band branch-line coupler","unequal power division","external frequency-dependent impedance transformer","maximum power-dividing ratio","frequency ratio","terminated impedance values","microstrip branch-line coupler"]},{"kwd":["Arbitrary power division","branch-line coupler","dual-band application","four arbitrary terminated resistances"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701169/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"An Analytical Design Method for a Novel Dual-Band Unequal Coupler With Four Arbitrary Terminated Resistances","volume":"61","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6701169/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14280700","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2014CB339900"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201027 and 61327806"},{"fundingName":"Open Project of the State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves","grantNumber":"K201316"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20120005120006"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Key Laboratory of Work Safety Intelligent Monitoring (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical Design Method for a Novel Dual-Band Unequal Coupler With Four Arbitrary Terminated Resistances","sourcePdf":"tie-wu-2297299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069943S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6809870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6809870","articleId":"6701169","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701171,"authors":[{"name":"Kang Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/6848879/6701171/6701171-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kang Li received the BS degree in information and computational science, the MS degree in expert system and intelligent control from Northwestern Polytechnical University, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, and the MS degree in computer science and engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, in 2011.

To build an effective representation for prediction, human activities can be characterized by a complex temporal composition of constituent simple actions and interacting objects. Different from early detection on short-duration simple actions, we propose a novel framework for long -duration complex activity prediction by discovering three key aspects of activity: Causality, Context-cue, and Predictability. The major contributions of our work include: (1) a general framework is proposed to systematically address the problem of complex activity prediction by mining temporal sequence patterns; (2) probabilistic suffix tree (PST) is introduced to model causal relationships between constituent actions, where both large and small order Markov dependencies between action units are captured; (3) the context-cue, especially interactive objects information, is modeled through sequential pattern mining (SPM), where a series of action and object co-occurrence are encoded as a complex symbolic sequence; (4) we also present a predictive accumulative function (PAF) to depict the predictability of each kind of activity. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated on two experimental scenarios with two data sets for each: action-only prediction and context-aware prediction. Our method achieves superior performance for predicting global activity classes and local action units.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2013.2297321","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/6848879/06701171.pdf","startPage":"1644","endPage":"1657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2013.2297321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6848879","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of Human Activity by Discovering Temporal Sequence Patterns","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701171","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701171/","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of Human Activity by Discovering Temporal Sequence Patterns","volume":"36","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14429338","pubMedId":"26353344","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701171/","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of Human Activity by Discovering Temporal Sequence Patterns","sourcePdf":"tpami-li-2297321-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.22751S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"6848879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6848879","articleId":"6701171","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701191,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic School of Engineering of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6786374/6701191/jiang-2294968-small.gif","p":["Yu Jiang (S'11) was born in Xi'an, China.

The proposed approach uses the novel discrete-time model of the inverter and output LC filter in order to predict the variables to be controlled. These predictions are carried out for the 16 switching states of the inverter and are evaluated using a cost function. The switching state that forces the load voltages to be closest to their respective references is chosen and applied to the inverter. The behavior of the predictive controller has been investigated, and the changes to both inductive and capacitive filter parameters have been considered. In order to improve the reliability of the fourth leg as well as the overall inverter efficiency, a solution is proposed, which combines hardware and software reconfigurations. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified through simulation and experimental results considering single-/three-phase, balanced/unbalanced, and linear/nonlinear loads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model Predictive Approach for a Simple and Effective Load Voltage Control of Four-Leg Inverter With an Output - Filter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2297291","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6809870/06701197.pdf","startPage":"5259","endPage":"5270","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2297291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809870","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701197/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Model Predictive Approach for a Simple and Effective Load Voltage Control of Four-Leg Inverter With an Output <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"TeX\">$LC$</tex-math></inline-formula> Filter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6701197/","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14267323","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingName":"Fondecyt Initiation into Research 11121492"},{"fundingName":"CONICYT PIIC 2048 Project"},{"fundingName":"Universidad T\u00e9cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda"},{"fundingName":"NPRP","grantNumber":"4-077-2-028"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Predictive Approach for a Simple and Effective Load Voltage Control of Four-Leg Inverter With an Output <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"TeX\">$LC$</tex-math></inline-formula> Filter","sourcePdf":"tie-rivera-2297291-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128054S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6809870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"129","xplore-issue":"6809870","articleId":"6701197","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701200,"authors":[{"name":"Marzyeh Ghassemi","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/6815992/6701200/6701200-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marzyeh Ghassemi received the B.S. degree in computer science and electrical engineering with a minor in applied mathematics from New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, USA, in 2005 as a Goldwater Scholar, and the M.Sc. degree in biomedical engineering from Oxford University, U.K., as a Marshall Scholar.

Standard voice assessment approaches cannot accurately determine the actual nature, prevalence, and pathological impact of hyperfunctional vocal behaviors because such behaviors can vary greatly across the course of an individual's typical day and may not be clearly demonstrated during a brief clinical encounter. Thus, it would be clinically valuable to develop noninvasive ambulatory measures that can reliably differentiate vocal hyperfunction from normal patterns of vocal behavior. As an initial step toward this goal we used an accelerometer taped to the neck surface to provide a continuous, noninvasive acceleration signal designed to capture some aspects of vocal behavior related to vocal cord nodules, a common manifestation of vocal hyperfunction. We gathered data from 12 female adult patients diagnosed with vocal fold nodules and 12 control speakers matched for age and occupation. We derived features from weeklong neck-surface acceleration recordings by using distributions of sound pressure level and fundamental frequency over 5-min windows of the acceleration signal and normalized these features so that intersubject comparisons were meaningful. We then used supervised machine learning to show that the two groups exhibit distinct vocal behaviors that can be detected using the acceleration signal. We were able to correctly classify 22 of the 24 subjects, suggesting that in the future measures of the acceleration signal could be used to detect patients with the types of aberrant vocal behaviors that are associated with hyperfunctional voice disorders.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Pathology","Acceleration","Biomedical measurement","Accelerometers","Electronic

However, all existing studies on such cooperative cognitive radio networks (CCRNs) operate in the temporal domain only, which limits the performance of both PUs and SUs. On the other hand, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) enables transmission of multiple independent data streams in the spatial domain to improve capacity. Taking advantage of the MIMO technique in CCRNs is an unexplored area that we investigate in this paper. We propose a novel MIMO-CCRN framework, which enables the SUs to utilize MIMO techniques to cooperatively relay the traffic for the PUs, while concurrently accessing the same channel to transmit their own traffic. Specifically, we consider two typical network scenarios. For the case of a general PU link and multiple SUs, we provide theoretical analysis for the link rates and then formulate an optimization model based on a Stackelberg game to maximize the utilities of PUs and SUs. In addition, we extend our analysis to a practical cellular network with multiple MIMO-empowered femtocells, and provide an algorithm to find a stable matching of the PUs and SUs. Evaluation results show that high utility gains are achieved by both PUs and SUs by leveraging MIMO spatial cooperation in our proposed framework.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2014","accessionNumber":"14581694","htmlLink":"/document/6701221/","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Multiple Antennas in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"New York State Center for Advanced Technology in Telecommunications"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Industry/University Cooperative Research Wireless Internet Center for Advanced Technlogy"},{"fundingName":"NSF Partnerships for Innovation: Accelerating Innovation Research","grantNumber":"1237821"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Multiple Antennas in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-hua-2297438-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151753S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6895341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6895341","articleId":"6701221","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701223,"authors":[{"name":"Joao Azevedo","affiliation":["LIRMM, University Montpellier, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Montpellier, France"],"bio":{"p":["Joao Azevedo received the B.S. degree in computer engineering and the M.S. degree in microelectronics from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and the Ph.D. degree in microelectronics from Universite Montpellier II, Montpellier, France.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow with CNRS/LIRMM, Montpellier.

Among existing MRAM technologies, thermally assisted switching (TAS)-MRAM technology offers several advantages compared with other technologies: selectivity, single magnetic field, and high-integration density. In this paper, we analyze the impact of resistive-open defects on TAS-MRAM behavior. Electrical simulations were performed on a hypothetical 16 word TAS-MRAM architecture enabling any combination of read and write operations. Results show that read and write sequences may be affected by resistive-open defects that may induce single and double-cell faulty behaviors.

Three TWR protocols where the terminals adopt different combining methods on the received signals from a relay link and a direct link are considered, and the tight approximate expressions of average SERs for these protocols are theoretically derived. Based on the analytic results, the SER performances of the three TWR protocols are compared in the interference-limited scenario.

However, measuring or estimating the product quality online in many industrial plants is usually not feasible using the available techniques. In this paper, a data-driven soft-sensor using case-based reasoning (CBR) and fuzzy-similarity rough sets is proposed for product quality estimation. Owning to the sustained learning ability, the modeling of a CBR soft-sensor does not need any additional model correction which is otherwise required by the neural network based methods to overcome the slow time-varying nature of industrial processes. Because the conventional k-nearest neighbor ( k-NN) algorithm is strongly influenced by the value of k, an improved k-NN algorithm with dynamic adjustment of case similarity threshold is proposed to retrieve sufficient matching cases for making a correct estimation. Moreover, considering that the estimation accuracy of the CBR soft-sensor system is closely related to the weights of case feature, a feature weighting algorithm using fuzzy-similarity rough sets is proposed in this paper.

However, cross-tier interference mitigation is considered to be one of the major challenges. Distributed-game-based power control approaches are effective for interference management in wireless networks. In this paper, we focus on the optimal power allocation for uplink transmission in two-tier femtocell networks and take into account the different service requirements and design objectives of macrocell user equipment (MUE) and femtocell user equipment (FUE) devices. The framework of hierarchical game with a multiple-leader-multiple-follower model is adopted to investigate the uplink power allocation problem. By using hierarchical game, on one hand, the utilities of both MUE and FUE devices are maximized; on the other hand, the uplink protection of MUE devices is highlighted. To obtain the game equilibrium (GE) distributively, we develop the iterative power update rules for both MUE and FUE devices. Moreover, given channel uncertainty, a robust hierarchical game is formulated and solved distributively. For implementations, the running process of the proposed hierarchical games is analyzed in detail. Finally, numerical results show the convergence of the hierarchical games without and with channel uncertainty. Moreover, it is also demonstrated that, in either case, the GE is unique and that the game is effective.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2296977","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6851966/06701241.pdf","startPage":"2819","endPage":"2835","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2296977","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6851966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical-Game-Based Uplink Power Control in Femtocell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701241/","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical-Game-Based Uplink Power Control in Femtocell Networks","volume":"63","issue":"6","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14432067","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701241/","dateOfInsertion":"10 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Project of China","grantNumber":"2010CB731803"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61221003, 61174127, 61104033, 61273181 and 61203104"},{"fundingName":"Research Foundation for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20110073120025, 20110073130005 and 20121333120012"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province of China","grantNumber":"F2012203126"},{"fundingName":"Cyber Joint Innovation Center, Hangzhou, China"},{"fundingName":"Huawei Innovation Research Program","grantNumber":"IRP-2013-05-06"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical-Game-Based Uplink Power Control in Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-han-2296977-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116422S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6851966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6851966","articleId":"6701241","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701265,"authors":[{"name":"\u017deljko Hocenski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Osijek, Osijek, Croatia"],"firstName":"\u017deljko","lastName":"Hocenski","id":"37542462600"},{"name":"Ivan Aleksi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Osijek, Osijek, Croatia"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Aleksi","id":"37542464000"},{"name":"Vlado Sruk","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"firstName":"Vlado","lastName":"Sruk","id":"37542505700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3181-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6701265","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Software","Graphical user interfaces","Adders","Hardware design languages","Debugging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","computer aided instruction","electronic engineering computing","electronic engineering education","field programmable gate arrays","virtual instrumentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive virtual devices platform","FPGA modules verification","student courses","digital design","FPGA based verification platform","functional verification platform","PicoBlaze CPU-based design","Spartan 3 XC3S200 FPGA device","VHDL","HW/SW codesign"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA validation","FPGA verification","debugging HDL modules","HDL development process","PicoBlaze CPU"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the FPGA based verification platform that is dedicated to improve student efficiency for the course on Digital Design with FPGAs.

To address those concerns, we propose a hybrid cloud computing model which users may adopt as a viable and cost-saving methodology to make the best use of public cloud services along with their privately-owned (legacy) data centers. As the core of this hybrid cloud computing model, an intelligent workload factoring service is designed for proactive workload management. It enables federation between on- and off-premise infrastructures for hosting Internet-based applications, and the intelligence lies in the explicit segregation of base workload and flash crowd workload, the two naturally different components composing the application workload. The core technology of the intelligent workload factoring service is a fast frequent data item detection algorithm, which enables factoring incoming requests not only on volume but also on data content, upon a changing application data popularity. Through analysis and extensive evaluation with real-trace driven simulations and experiments on a hybrid testbed consisting of local computing platform and Amazon Cloud service platform, we showed that the proactive workload management technology can enable reliable workload prediction in the base workload zone (with simple statistical methods), achieve resource efficiency (e.g., 78% higher server capacity than that in base workload zone) and reduce data cache/replication overhead (up to two orders of magnitude) in the flash crowd workload zone, and react fast (with an X^2 speed-up factor) to the changing application data popularity upon the arrival of load spikes.","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2013.122313.130448","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/6804401/06701292.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2013.122313.130448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6804401","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proactive Workload Management in Hybrid Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701292/","displayDocTitle":"Proactive Workload Management in Hybrid Cloud Computing","volume":"11","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701292/","publicationDate":"March 2014","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2014","accessionNumber":"14265354","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proactive Workload Management in Hybrid Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"090-tnsm1403-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062166S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"6804401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"6804401","articleId":"6701292","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6701293,"authors":[{"name":"Jean Bacon","affiliation":["Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Bacon","id":"37284641000"},{"name":"David Eyers","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Otago, New Zealand"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Eyers","id":"37267825900"},{"name":"Thomas F.

Information Flow Control (IFC) is a well understood Mandatory Access Control methodology. The earliest IFC models targeted security in a centralised environment, but decentralised forms of IFC have been designed and implemented, often within academic research projects. As a result, there is potential for decentralised IFC to achieve better cloud security than is available today. In this paper we describe the properties of cloud computing-Platform-as-a-Service clouds in particular-and review a range of IFC models and implementations to identify opportunities for using IFC within a cloud computing context. Since IFC security is linked to the data that it protects, both tenants and providers of cloud services can agree on security policy, in a manner that does not require them to understand and rely on the particulars of the cloud software stack in order to effect enforcement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Flow Control for Secure Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/TNSM.2013.122313.130423","startPage":"76","endPage":"89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSM.2013.122313.130423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6804401","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/4275028/6804401/06701293.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701293","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701293/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Information Flow Control for Secure Cloud Computing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6701293/","dateOfInsertion":"25 April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14265355","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Flow Control for Secure Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"076-tnsm1403-bacon.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130741S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4275028","isNumber":"6804401","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4275028","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"6804401","articleId":"6701293","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6701294,"authors":[{"name":"Wessam Mesbah","affiliation":["lectrical Engineering Department, Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6750007/6701294/6701294-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wessam Mesbah (S'08-M'09) received his Ph.D. in 2008 from McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada, and his M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees (with highest honors) in electrical engineering from Alexandria University, Alexandria, Egypt, in 2003 and 2000, respectively.

We analyze the problem under the assumption of Rayleigh fading channels where rates and power ratios of the source layers are jointly optimized based on channel statistics information, with the objective of maximizing the expected user satisfaction which is usually defined by a differentiable concave increasing utility function of the total decoded rate. As special cases, we consider two utility functions; namely, the expected total decoded rate at the receiver and the expected rate distortion of a Gaussian source. We show that the optimal solution can be obtained using a two-dimensional bisection search for any number of layers. The outer bisection search is over the Lagrangian dual variable and the inner bisection search is over the decoding threshold of the layer. Moreover, we show that with a small number of layers, we can approach the performance upper bound that is achieved by transmitting an infinite number of layers.","doi":"10.1109/TW.2013.123013.130441","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6750007/06701294.pdf","startPage":"834","endPage":"845","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TW.2013.123013.130441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Jointly Optimal Rate and Power Allocation for Multilayer Transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Jointly Optimal Rate and Power Allocation for Multilayer Transmission","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701294/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","volume":"13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701294/","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14131457","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Jointly Optimal Rate and Power Allocation for Multilayer Transmission","sourcePdf":"0834-tw1402-mesbah.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093357S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6750007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6750007","articleId":"6701294","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6701316,"authors":[{"name":"Ernesto Ciaramella","affiliation":["Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Italy"],"firstName":"Ernesto","lastName":"Ciaramella","id":"37277405600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6701316","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":3877},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Couplers","Passive optical networks","Optical receivers","Bandwidth","Optical fibers","Optical polarization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","low-pass filters","numerical analysis","optical distortion","optical fibre couplers","optical fibre filters","optical fibre polarisation","optical receivers","optical tuning","passive optical networks","photodiodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-pass filtering","intrinsic second order distortions","signal carrier","frequency-detuning","electrical signal","numerical simulations","mathematical derivation","polarization states","local oscillator","analogue processing","photodiodes","coupler","phase-diversity receiver","access networks","polarization-independent operation","low-cost coherent OOK receivers","low-cost coherent OOK systems","polarization-independent receivers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber optic communication","bit error ratio (BER)","coherent systems","polarization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701316","abstract":"We demonstrate analytically a novel scheme to obtain polarization-independent operation in low-cost coherent OOK receivers, suitable for access networks.

QCQP problems are hard to solve, in general, and they are typically approached by solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation followed by a postprocessing procedure. Existing postprocessing schemes include Gaussian randomization to generate an approximate solution, rank reduction procedure (the so-called purification), and some specific rank-one matrix decomposition techniques to yield a globally optimal solution. In this paper, we propose several randomized postprocessing methods to output not an approximate solution but a globally optimal solution for some solvable instances of the double-sided QCQP (i.e., instances with a small number of constraints). We illustrate their applicability in robust receive beamforming, radar optimal code design, and broadcast beamforming for multiuser communications. As a byproduct, we derive an alternative (shorter) proof for the Sturm-Zhang rank-one matrix decomposition theorem.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2297683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6732988/06701323.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2297683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6732988","startPage":"1093","endPage":"1108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Randomized Algorithms for Optimal Solutions of Double-Sided QCQP With Applications in Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Randomized Algorithms for Optimal Solutions of Double-Sided QCQP With Applications in Signal Processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701323/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"5","publicationDate":"March1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14078307","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6701323/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Randomized Algorithms for Optimal Solutions of Double-Sided QCQP With Applications in Signal Processing","sourcePdf":"tsp-huang-2297683-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139107S","chronDate":"March1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6732988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6732988","articleId":"6701323","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6701327,"authors":[{"name":"Dobroslav Tsonev","affiliation":["The University of Edinburgh, Institute for Digital Communications, Joint Research Institute for Signal and Image Processing, Edinburgh, U.K."],"firstName":"Dobroslav","lastName":"Tsonev","id":"38234626700"},{"name":"Hyunchae Chun","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K."],"firstName":"Hyunchae","lastName":"Chun","id":"38512174700"},{"name":"Sujan Rajbhandari","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K."],"firstName":"Sujan","lastName":"Rajbhandari","id":"37320819900"},{"name":"Jonathan J.

The effects of process flows and device structures on the electrical properties are investigated in this paper. We demonstrated a threshold voltage (Vth) of 4.3 V by adjusting the built-in voltage of the diode formed between the p-GaN and channel by the alloy temperature. Next, we found the existence of parallel conduction paths of the p-GaN layer and 2-D electron gas (2DEG) channel in such a HEMT structure. By removing p-GaN above the gate-source and gate-drain regions, current conduction migrates from p-GaN to 2DEG channel. The process window of the p-GaN residual thickness to ensure a steady forward current-voltage operation was estimated to be 10\u00b15 nm in our case. Finally, with the p-GaN underneath the gate contact to deplete surface leakage current, an E-mode HEMT with a breakdown voltage (VBD) of 1630 V is achieved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancement-Mode GaN-Based High-Electron Mobility Transistors on the Si Substrate With a P-Type GaN Cap Layer","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2013.2294337","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/6717047/06701333.pdf","startPage":"460","endPage":"465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2013.2294337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6717047","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701333","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701333/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Enhancement-Mode GaN-Based High-Electron Mobility Transistors on the Si Substrate With a P-Type GaN Cap Layer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"61","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6701333/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14056359","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancement-Mode GaN-Based High-Electron Mobility Transistors on the Si Substrate With a P-Type GaN Cap Layer","sourcePdf":"ted-huang-2294337-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086712S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"6717047","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"6717047","articleId":"6701333","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6701334,"authors":[{"name":"Sira Gonzalez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/6701198/6701334/6701334-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sira Gonzalez received a telecommunications engineering degree from the University of the Basque Country, Bilbao, Spain, in 2007.

Temporal continuity constraints are applied to the selected pitch candidates and a voiced speech probability is computed from the likelihood ratio of two classifiers, one for voiced speech and one for unvoiced speech/silence.

One of the main issues significantly affecting the FCV performance is the chosen hybrid system topology along with system components, which requires research to find the best hybrid structure for the lowest fuel consumption. Although several hybridization topologies have been studied separately in the literature, an overall investigation and fuel consumption comparison of the most promising fuel-cell (FC) power-train topologies along with the experimental verification should be realized. In this regard, this paper demonstrates a detailed comparison of four different hybrid FC power-train configurations with feasible battery and ultracapacitor (UC) combinations, on a test bench using normalized ECE-15 drive cycle. The results demonstrate that the lowest equivalent fuel consumption can be achieved with FC/battery/UC hybrid combination.","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2013.2297702","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/6868320/06701339.pdf","startPage":"552","endPage":"561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2013.2297702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6868320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuel Consumption Comparison of Different Battery/Ultracapacitor Hybridization Topologies for Fuel-Cell Vehicles on a Test Bench","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701339/","displayDocTitle":"Fuel Consumption Comparison of Different Battery/Ultracapacitor Hybridization Topologies for Fuel-Cell Vehicles on a Test Bench","volume":"2","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14485741","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701339/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuel Consumption Comparison of Different Battery/Ultracapacitor Hybridization Topologies for Fuel-Cell Vehicles on a Test Bench","sourcePdf":"jestpe-dusmez-2297702-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081257S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"6868320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6868320","articleId":"6701339","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701341,"authors":[{"name":"Rosmadi Abdullah","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Pahang, Pahang, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6809870/6701341/abdul-2297315-small.gif","p":["\nRosmadi Abdullah (M'12) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng.\ndegrees in electrical engineering from the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru, Malaysia, in 2002 and 2007,\nrespectively.

We use a confocal infrared laser scanning optical microscope to collect multimodal images through the backside of the IC. Individual modes correspond to passive reflectivity measurements or active measurements, such as light-induced voltage alteration. The modes are registered and stored in a multidimensional data cube. We apply a machine learning algorithm using a binary representation to identify a variety of data structures from transistors to entire logic cells. Because of the compact representation, objects can be detected rapidly. We show that by increasing the number of imaging modes used to develop the descriptor, we can significantly increase recognition accuracy. The approach allows recognition of poorly resolved components, whose primary distinguishing features are below traditional optical resolution limits, and is general enough to be applied to multiple design processes.

The SHM has recently attracted significant attention in the aerospace and civil infrastructure industries because of its potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce maintenance costs, and enhance the structural reliability in a real-time operation basis. The SHM is developing to include multiple types of sensors and even onboard processing for diagnostics and decision making. Advanced multidisciplinary engineering and manufacturing technologies are being developed enabling integration of sensors, network hardware, and semiconductors into structures with minimal parasitic effects. This is precisely the foundation for developing intelligent structures. This paper highlights recent developments in microfabricated expandable sensor networks for the SHM and intelligent structures at Stanford University. Fabrication and testing of microfabricated ultrasonic and temperature sensing systems in expandable networks are discussed. These advances applied to the SHM and intelligent structures support a paradigm change in design, manufacturing, and maintenance of structures. Successful implementation of the SHM will require a close collaborative effort among academia, government, and industry.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6819883/06701343.pdf","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2013.2297699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2013.2297699","startPage":"2138","endPage":"2144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microfabricated Expandable Sensor Networks for Intelligent Sensing Materials","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701343/","displayDocTitle":"Microfabricated Expandable Sensor Networks for Intelligent Sensing Materials","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701343/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"14331822","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research MURI Program titled \u00bfBio-Inspired Intelligent Sensing Materials for Fly-By-Feel Autonomous Vehicles,\u00bf"},{"fundingName":"Boeing Company under the Project titled \u00bfComposite Material Modeling and Structural Health Monitoring\u00bf under the supervision of J.-B.

In this paper, mathematical models of wind/solar generation systems, battery, and supercapacitor are built, the objective optimization function of HESS is proposed, and various constraints are considered. To solve the optimization problem, improved simulated annealing particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed by introducing the simulated annealing idea into particle swarm algorithm. The new algorithm enhance the ability to escape from local optimum and improve the diversity of particle swarm, then help to avoid prematurity and enhance the global searching ability of the algorithm. With the example system, the optimization results show that the convergence of new algorithm is faster than the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm and its cost optimization is better, which demonstrated the correctness and validity of the proposed models and algorithms. This method can provide a reference for the capacity optimization of HESS in wind/solar generation system.","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2013.2288804","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/6774903/06701344.pdf","startPage":"408","endPage":"415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2013.2288804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Battery\u2013Supercapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage Station in Wind/Solar Generation System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701344","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701344/","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Battery\u2013Supercapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage Station in Wind/Solar Generation System","volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14180654","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Battery\u2013Supercapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage Station in Wind/Solar Generation System","sourcePdf":"tste-zhou-2288804-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078912S","chronDate":"April  2014","isNumber":"6774903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"109","articleId":"6701344","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6701345,"authors":[{"name":"Wing-Chau Ng","affiliation":["COPL, Universit\u00e9 Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Wing-Chau","lastName":"Ng","id":"37062047300"},{"name":"An T.

The secondary network capacity can be enhanced in a cost effective way by means of spatial diversity, that can be achieved by adding multiple antennas on the secondary network terminals and performing antenna selection. In this paper, the performance of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) secondary link with transmit antenna selection (TAS) at the transmitter and maximum ratio combining (MRC) at the receiver is analyzed. A peak transmit power constraint at the secondary transmitter is considered in addition to the interference power constraint and two scenarios are considered; 1) the MIMO cognitive system with TAS/MRC (MCS-TM) does not experience interference from the primary network (denote by MCS-TM-NI), and 2) MCS-TM does experience interference from the primary network (denote by MCS-TM-WI). The performance of both MCS-TM-NI and MCS-TM-WI is analyzed and, for a Rayleigh faded channel, closed-form expression for the outage probability is derived. In addition, closed-form expressions of the moment generating function, the symbol error rate and the ergodic capacity are obtained for the MCS-TM-NI. Asymptotic performance analysis of the MCS-TM-NI reveals that TAS/MRC in a MIMO cognitive system achieves a generalized diversity gain equal to the product of the number of transmit and receive antennas. Numerical results are also presented to corroborate the derived analytical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of a Power Limited Spectrum Sharing System With TAS/MRC","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2297684","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6716102/06701360.pdf","startPage":"954","endPage":"967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2297684","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6716102","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701360/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2014","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of a Power Limited Spectrum Sharing System With TAS/MRC","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6701360/","dateOfInsertion":"21 January 2014","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14056603","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of a Power Limited Spectrum Sharing System With TAS/MRC","sourcePdf":"tsp-khan-2297684-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110695S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6716102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6716102","articleId":"6701360","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701362,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Shi","affiliation":["Wireless@kth, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/11/6755478/6701362/6701362-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lei Shi received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2007, and the M.S. degree in wireless systems from the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, in 2009, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Communication Systems.

Since IP-access can be used for all types of services, instead of a plethora of dedicated, single-service systems, there is a significant potential to make spectrum use more efficient. In this paper, the feasibility and potential benefit of replacing the current terrestrial UHF TV broadcasting system with a mobile, cellular data (IP-) network are analyzed. In the cellular network, TV content would be provided as one of the services (CellTV). In the investigation, we consider typical Swedish rural and urban environments. We use different models for TV viewing patterns and cellular technologies as expected in the year 2020. Results of the quantitative analysis indicate that CellTV distribution can be beneficial if the TV consumption trend goes toward more specialized programming, more local contents, and more on-demand requests. Mobile cellular systems, with their flexible unicast capabilities, will be an ideal platform to provide these services. However, the results also demonstrate that CellTV is not a spectrum-efficient replacement for terrestrial TV broadcasting with current viewing patterns (i.e., a moderate number of channels with each a high numbers of viewers). In this case, it is doubtful whether the expected spectrum savings can motivate the necessary investments in upgrading cellular sites and developing advanced TV receiver required for the success of CellTV distribution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701362/","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6701362/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14144325","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"CellTV\u2014On the Benefit of TV Distribution Over Cellular Networks: A Case Study","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CellTV\u2014On the Benefit of TV Distribution Over Cellular Networks: A Case Study","sourcePdf":"tbc-sung-2295255-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062634S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"11","isNumber":"6755478","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6755478","articleId":"6701362","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6701369,"authors":[{"name":"Yoav Shechtman","affiliation":["Department of Chemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6716102/6701369/6701369-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yoav Shechtman received the B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering and the B.Sc degree in Physics in 2007 (cum Laude), and the Ph.D. in Physics 2013, all from the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.

Due to the loss of Fourier phase information, this problem is ill-posed. Therefore, prior information on the signal is needed in order to enable its recovery. In this work we consider the case in which the signal is known to be sparse, i.e., it consists of a small number of nonzero elements in an appropriate basis. We propose a fast local search method for recovering a sparse signal from measurements of its Fourier transform (or other linear transform) magnitude which we refer to as GESPAR: GrEedy Sparse PhAse Retrieval. Our algorithm does not require matrix lifting, unlike previous approaches, and therefore is potentially suitable for large scale problems such as images. Simulation results indicate that GESPAR is fast and more accurate than existing techniques in a variety of settings.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6716102/06701369.pdf","startPage":"928","endPage":"938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2297687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2297687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6716102","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701369","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GESPAR: Efficient Phase Retrieval of Sparse Signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Vectors","Sparse matrices","Discrete Fourier transforms","Convergence","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","Fourier transforms","greedy algorithms","search problems","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GESPAR","sparse signal phase retrieval","Fourier transform","linear transform","Fourier phase information loss","nonzero elements","fast local search method","greedy sparse phase retrieval","nonconvex optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-convex optimization","phase retrieval","sparse signal processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701369/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"GESPAR: Efficient Phase Retrieval of Sparse Signals","volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6701369/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14056591","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GESPAR: Efficient Phase Retrieval of Sparse Signals","sourcePdf":"tsp-shechtman-2297687-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10867S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6716102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"186","xplore-issue":"6716102","articleId":"6701369","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701371,"authors":[{"name":"C.

After deriving an expression for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the amplified coherent receiver, we calculate an analytical expression for the optimum local oscillator (LO) optical power which maximizes the SNR, and an approximated closed-form solution for the receiver sensitivity, valid in most of practical cases. This analytical calculation allows to derive, when the impairments of the fiber are compensated, the position of the amplifier into the link that maximizes the optical link power budget. The approximated closed-form solutions are compared with results obtained with a numerical approach. From our investigation it emerges that, in a single-channel fully compensated DP-QPSK coherent system, the performances of both booster and in-line configurations can be even better than that ones of the preamplifier, but they are strongly dependent on the unamplified receiver features, and can require a proper adjustment of the LO optical power, to make the sensitivity compliant with the requirements. Diversely, the performances of a preamplified coherent receiver can be worse, but the amplifier position makes the coherent receiver practically independent on its intrinsic noise sources.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2013.2297628","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6740872/06701371.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2013.2297628","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6740872","startPage":"1295","endPage":"1306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity and Power Budget of a Homodyne Coherent DP-QPSK System With Optical Amplification and Electronic Compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity and Power Budget of a Homodyne Coherent DP-QPSK System With Optical Amplification and Electronic Compensation","chronOrPublicationDate":"April1,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701371/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"7","publicationDate":"April1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14111647","dateOfInsertion":"21 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity and Power Budget of a Homodyne Coherent DP-QPSK System With Optical Amplification and Electronic Compensation","sourcePdf":"jlt-crognale-2297628-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050312S","chronDate":"April1,  2014","isNumber":"6740872","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"3","articleId":"6701371","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701375,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaolong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Naval Aeronautical and Astronautical University, Yantai, Shandong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6716102/6701375/6701375-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaolong Chen was born in Shandong, China, in 1985.

It can not only eliminate the effect of DFM by selecting a proper rotation angle but also achieve long-time coherent integration without ARU effect. The RFRFT can be regarded as a special Doppler filter bank composed of filters with different rotation angles, which indicates a generalization of the traditional moving target detection (MTD) and FRFT methods. Some useful properties and the likelihood ratio test detector of RFRFT are derived for maneuvering target detection. Finally, numerical experiments of aerial target and marine target detection are carried out using simulated and real radar datasets. The results demonstrate that for integration gain and detection ability, the proposed method is superior to MTD, FRFT, and Radon-Fourier transform under low signal-to-clutter/noise ratio (SCR/SNR) environments. Moreover, the trajectory of target can be easily obtained via RFRFT as well.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2013.2297682","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6716102/06701375.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2013.2297682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6716102","startPage":"939","endPage":"953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maneuvering Target Detection via Radon-Fractional Fourier Transform-Based Long-Time Coherent Integration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maneuvering Target Detection via Radon-Fractional Fourier Transform-Based Long-Time Coherent Integration","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.15,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Feb.15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14056605","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6701375/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maneuvering Target Detection via Radon-Fractional Fourier Transform-Based Long-Time Coherent Integration","sourcePdf":"tsp-chen-2297682-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110119S","chronDate":"Feb.15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6716102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"209","xplore-issue":"6716102","articleId":"6701375","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6701384,"authors":[{"name":"Min Shao","affiliation":["School of Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University and Xi'an Shiyou University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Shao","id":"38468270600"},{"name":"Xueguang Qiao","affiliation":["School of Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University and Xi'an Shiyou University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xueguang","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37582206500"},{"name":"Haiwei Fu","affiliation":["School of Science, Xi'an Shiyou University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Haiwei","lastName":"Fu","id":"38581244200"},{"name":"Huidong Li","affiliation":["School of Science, Xi'an Shiyou University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Huidong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085402919"},{"name":"Zhenan Jia","affiliation":["School of Science, Xi'an Shiyou University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhenan","lastName":"Jia","id":"38468010600"},{"name":"Hong Zhou","affiliation":["School of Science, Xi'an Shiyou University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37086625980"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6701384","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":880},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Refractive Index Sensing of SMS Fiber Structure Based Mach-Zehnder Interferometer","abstract":"A Mach-Zehnder interferometer based on single-mode-thin-core-multimode-single-mode (STMS) fiber structure for refractive index (RI) measurement is proposed and experimentally demonstrated.

To have significant effect, electric drive technologies must be economical in terms of cost, weight, and size while meeting performance and reliability expectations. Interior permanent magnet machines with fractional-slot concentrated windings have been shown to be good candidates for hybrid traction applications. One of the key challenges is the additional stator magnetomotive force sub- and superharmonic components that lead to higher losses in the rotor as well as saturation effects. This paper tries to address this issue by looking into the concept of stator shifting. The generalized concept of stator shifting in the context of the harmonic components that are targeted for cancellation is presented; the focus is on single-layer and double-layer windings that have stator space subharmonics. It is shown that the stator shifting can reduce the loss-producing harmonics on the rotor as well as help the flux weakening performance of the fractional-slot concentrated winding designs. The cancellation of the loss harmonics is introduced as a method in which a particular harmonic can be targeted as well as reduce the phase inductance of the machine allowing for more room in terms of the operating voltage at higher speed. The concept of stator shifting will be explained, and the effect of varying the shift angle on the various harmonic components and winding factors will be investigated. Various designs, arising out of single-layer and double winding layer 10-pole, 12-slot configuration (targeting the FreedomCAR specifications) with varied shift angles are evaluated. The comparison between these designs in terms of their power density, efficiency, and torque ripple is presented.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6777358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2013.2297515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/6777358/06701385.pdf","startPage":"5035","endPage":"5046","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2013.2297515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Approach of Stator Shifting in Interior Permanent-Magnet Machines Equipped With Fractional-Slot Concentrated Windings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Approach of Stator Shifting in Interior Permanent-Magnet Machines Equipped With Fractional-Slot Concentrated Windings","volume":"61","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6701385/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14181285","dateOfInsertion":"21 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701385/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Approach of Stator Shifting in Interior Permanent-Magnet Machines Equipped With Fractional-Slot Concentrated Windings","sourcePdf":"tie-elrefaie-2297515-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073927S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6777358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6777358","articleId":"6701385","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":6701386,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Hongzhi","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Hongzhi","id":"37681162900"},{"name":"Ma Song","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Ma","lastName":"Song","id":"37085590474"},{"name":"Liu Fengwei","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Fengwei","id":"37669486800"},{"name":"Tang Youxi","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Tang","lastName":"Youxi","id":"37421290400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6701386","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":471},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"In virtual multiple-input-multiple-output (V-MIMO) systems, employing a user-pairing algorithm can significantly improve system capacity and spectral efficiency using multiuser diversity. The optimal pairing algorithm can achieve optimal system performance, but it is not feasible to implement in practice due to its huge complexity. To solve the problem, an efficient suboptimal pairing algorithm with lower complexity is proposed, which maximizes the system throughput by selecting users one by one. Furthermore, to achieve a good balance between throughput and user fairness, a novel pairing algorithm is derived, which combines the advantages of the suboptimal pairing algorithm and proportional fair (PF) criteria. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better fairness and higher system throughput than the double PF (D-PF) algorithm, and has much lower complexity than the optimal pairing algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6895341/06701386.pdf","startPage":"3481","endPage":"3486","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2013.2297517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2013.2297517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6895341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Suboptimal Multiuser-Pairing Algorithm With Low Complexity for Virtual MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Throughput","Transmitting antennas","MIMO","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","diversity reception","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suboptimal multiuser-pairing algorithm","low complexity","virtual MIMO systems","virtual multiple-input-multiple-output systems","system capacity improvement","spectral efficiency improvement","multiuser diversity","optimal pairing algorithm","system throughput maximization","user fairness","proportional fair criteria","Long-Term Evolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complexity","proportional fair (PF)","throughput","user pairing","virtual multiple-input multiple-output (V-MIMO)"]},{"kwd":["Complexity","proportional fair (PF)","throughput","user pairing","virtual multiple-input multiple-output (V-MIMO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701386/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Suboptimal Multiuser-Pairing Algorithm With Low Complexity for Virtual MIMO Systems","volume":"63","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6701386/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14581701","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271164, U1035002/L05, 61001087, 61101034 and 60901018"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Suboptimal Multiuser-Pairing Algorithm With Low Complexity for Virtual MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-song-2297517-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075696S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6895341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6895341","articleId":"6701386","onlineDate":"06 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6701395,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This paper introduces Minitaur, an event-driven neural network accelerator, which is designed for low power and high performance. As an field-programmable gate array-based system, it can be integrated into existing robotics or it can offload computationally expensive neural network tasks from the CPU. The version presented here implements a spiking deep network which achieves 19 million postsynaptic currents per second on 1.5 W of power and supports up to 65 K neurons per board. The system records 92% accuracy on the MNIST handwritten digit classification and 71% accuracy on the 20 newsgroups classification data set. Due to its event-driven nature, it allows for trading off between accuracy and latency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701396/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","volume":"22","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14760386","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6701396/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Minitaur, an Event-Driven FPGA-Based Spiking Network Accelerator","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University of Z\u00fcrich, ETH Z\u00fcrich"},{"fundingName":"Samsung Electronics Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Minitaur, an Event-Driven FPGA-Based Spiking Network Accelerator","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-liu-2294916-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084662S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6963544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"6963544","articleId":"6701396","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6701397,"authors":[{"name":"Sumit Bagga","affiliation":["ERL/DIMES, Delft University of Technology, Delft, CD, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6820808/6701397/6701397-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sumit Bagga was born in New Delhi, India, on October 31, 1977.

Fast access non-volatile memories (NVM) are under intense investigation to be integrated in Flip-Flops or computing memories to allow system power-off in standby state and save power. Spin Transfer Torque MRAM (STT-MRAM) is considered the most promising NVM to address this issue thanks to its high speed, low power, and infinite endurance. However, one of the disadvantages of STT-MRAM for the computing purpose is its relatively high write energy to build up Magnetic Flip-Flop (MFF). In this paper, we propose a power-efficient MFF design architecture to address this challenge based on the combination of checkpointing operation, power gating and self-enable mechanisms. Multi non-volatile storages can be integrated locally in a conventional FF without significant area overhead benefiting from the 3-D implementation of STT-MRAM. We performed electrical simulations (i.e. transient and statistical) to validate its functional behaviors and evaluate its performance by using an accurate spice model of STT-MRAM and an industrial 40 nm CMOS design kit. The simulation results confirm its lower power consumption compared to conventional CMOS FF and the other structures.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2295026","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6820808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2295026","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6820808/06701399.pdf","startPage":"1755","endPage":"1765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultra Low Power Magnetic Flip-Flop Based on Checkpointing/Power Gating and Self-Enable Mechanisms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Ultra Low Power Magnetic Flip-Flop Based on Checkpointing/Power Gating and Self-Enable Mechanisms","volume":"61","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701399/","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14331922","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701399/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultra Low Power Magnetic Flip-Flop Based on Checkpointing/Power Gating and Self-Enable Mechanisms","sourcePdf":"tcsi-zhao-2295026-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.213024S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6820808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6820808","articleId":"6701399","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6701400,"authors":[{"name":"Po Dong","affiliation":["Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Labs, Holmdel, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Po Dong received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in physics from Jilin University, Changchun, China, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2005.

This has led the computer scientists and researchers to think for finding robust security system for cloud computing. Detection, correction and prevention provide the complete solution for the security of cloud computing. Cryptography is one of the solutions which can prevent the intruders to enter into clouds for hacking information. In our paper, efficient hybrid cryptography system, Hybrid Vigenere Caesar Cipher Encryption (HVCCE) is proposed which will prevent the cloud infrastructure in three main places, in client location, in the network and in server. This cryptographic security system is designed in such a way so that computation time for decryption of cypher text messages for the hackers will be more compared to any single cryptographic system.","doi":"10.1109/CUBE.2013.20","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cloud & Ubiquitous Computing & Emerging Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cloud & Ubiquitous Computing & Emerging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6701453/6701454/06701475.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701454","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CUBE.2013.20","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing of Cryptography Based Security System for Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Designing of Cryptography Based Security System for Cloud Computing","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701475/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14030210","conferenceDate":"15-16 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing of Cryptography Based Security System for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"2235a052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066434S","chronDate":"15-16 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6701453","isNumber":"6701454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6701453","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6701454","articleId":"6701475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6701502,"authors":[{"name":"Steven L.

Though significant strides have been made in tackling the problem in controlled domains, significant challenges remain in solving it in the unconstrained domain. Two such scenarios are while recognizing faces acquired from distant cameras and when images are corrupted. The main factors that make this a challenging problem are image degradation due to noise and blur. In this paper we have developed and analyzed Score Level Fusion Technique (SLFT) of appearance based techniques and Minimum Average Correlation Energy (MACE) Gabor filter for face recognition in the presence of various noises and blurring effects. In SLFT the scores are obtained by using combinatory approach and Z-Score normalization of appearance based techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fisher faces (FF), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Fourier Spectra (FS), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Sparse Representation (SR). MACE Gabor filter is designed to minimize the average correlation energy (ACE) of the correlation outputs due to the training images while simultaneously satisfying the correlation peak constraints at the origin. The effect of minimizing the ACE is that the resulting correlation planes would yield values close to zero everywhere except at the location of a trained object, where it would produce a strong peak. We simulate the real world scenario by adding noises: Median noise, Salt and pepper noise and also adding blurring effects: Motion blur and Gaussian blur. To compare the performance of SLFT and MACE Gabor filter, we have considered six standard public face databases: IITK, ATT, JAFEE, CALTECH, GRIMANCE, and SHEFFIELD.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cloud & Ubiquitous Computing & Emerging Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/6701453/6701454/06701502.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"198","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Cloud & Ubiquitous Computing & Emerging Technologies","doi":"10.1109/CUBE.2013.43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CUBE.2013.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701454","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparative Study on Score Level Fusion Techniques and MACE Gabor Filters for Face Recognition in the Presence of Noises and Blurring Effects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gabor filters","Noise","Correlation","Face","Face recognition","Filter banks","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","combinatorial mathematics","computer vision","face recognition","Gabor filters","image denoising","image fusion","image representation","image restoration","independent component analysis","principal component analysis","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["score level fusion techniques","MACE Gabor filters","face recognition","noise effect","blurring effect","computer vision","unconstrained domain","distant cameras","image degradations","SLFT","appearance-based techniques","minimum average correlation energy","combinatory approach","Z-score normalization","principal component analysis","PCA","Fisherfaces","FF","independent component analysis","ICA","Fourier spectra","FS","singular value decomposition","SVD","sparse representation","SR","average correlation energy minimization","ACE minimization","correlation outputs","training images","correlation peak constraints","correlation planes","median noise","salt-and-pepper noise","motion blur","Gaussian blur","standard public face database","IITK database","ATT database","JAFEE database","CALTECH database","GRIMANCE database","SHEFFIELD database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Minimum Average Correlation Energy","Gabor filter","Principal Component Analysis","Fisherfaces","Independent Component Analysis","Fourier Spectra","Singular Value Decomposition","Sparse Representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-16 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Study on Score Level Fusion Techniques and MACE Gabor Filters for Face Recognition in the Presence of Noises and Blurring Effects","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701502/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14030191","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"15-16 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparative Study on Score Level Fusion Techniques and MACE Gabor Filters for Face Recognition in the Presence of Noises and Blurring Effects","confLoc":"Pune, India","sourcePdf":"2235a193.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128013S","chronDate":"15-16 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6701453","isNumber":"6701454","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6701453","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6701454","articleId":"6701502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6701534,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos A.

For this purpose, we evaluate the antenna resonance performance within four canonical single-tissue models of the human esophagus, stomach, small and large intestine. The antenna is further placed at different locations within the aforementioned tissue models in order to assess detuning issues related to its relative positioning within each of them. Inherent detuning issues are observed and discussed in the four different simplified tissue models considering three specific locations of the antenna in each model, resulting in twelve different scenarios. The resonance, radiation and safety performance of the ingestible antenna is, finally, evaluated.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intestines","Antenna radiation patterns","Stomach","Numerical models","Esophagus","Safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","endoscopes","tuning","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ingestible antennas","gastrointestinal tract","medical device radiocommunications service","MedRadio","UHF antennas","antenna resonance performance","canonical single-tissue models","antenna safety performance","frequency 401 MHz to 406 MHz"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBE.2013.6701534","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"13th IEEE International Conference on BioInformatics and BioEngineering","displayPublicationTitle":"13th IEEE International Conference on BioInformatics and BioEngineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689795/6701519/06701534.pdf","doi":"10.1109/BIBE.2013.6701534","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operation of ingestible antennas along the gastrointestinal tract: Detuning and performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Operation of ingestible antennas along the gastrointestinal tract: Detuning and performance","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14026408","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6701534/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operation of ingestible antennas along the gastrointestinal tract: Detuning and performance","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057032S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689795","isNumber":"6701519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689795","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6701519","articleId":"6701534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6701599,"authors":[{"name":"Shintaro Izumi","affiliation":["Kobe University, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shintaro","lastName":"Izumi","id":"37408458100"},{"name":"Masanao Nakano","affiliation":["Kobe University, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masanao","lastName":"Nakano","id":"38511524800"},{"name":"Ken Yamashita","affiliation":["Kobe University, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Yamashita","id":"37072973000"},{"name":"Takahide Fujii","affiliation":["Kobe University, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahide","lastName":"Fujii","id":"37960507600"},{"name":"Hiroshi Kawaguchi","affiliation":["Kobe University, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Kawaguchi","id":"37270375100"},{"name":"Masahiko Yoshimoto","affiliation":["Kobe University, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Yoshimoto","id":"37269600500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3163-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6701599","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"abstract":"To prevent lifestyle diseases, wearable bio-signal monitoring systems for daily life monitoring have attracted attention.

This new implementation platform require however quality of results in terms of speed, power and computational complexity, along with strict time-to-market schedules. Performance is sought by utilizing modern Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices, offering hundreds of GFLOPs with maximum power efficiency. Productivity is enforced with High-Level Synthesis (HLS) or Electronic System Level (ESL) or C-based hardware design methodologies, that offer an efficient abstraction level to boost-up early prototyping. However, just like the migration from schematics to Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) required specific coding styles for efficient hardware design, C-based hardware design also requires efficient coding guidelines to be followed. This paper presents a set of such coding guidelines, and evaluates their efficiency for FPGA based scientific, floating point arithmetic calculations. As found through extensive experimentation, the performance and area optimizations offered by efficient coding can improve the ones offered by HLS only, even more than 90%. So, while not every C program can be turned into hardware with the press of a button, efficient coded C programs can offer a profitable productivity boost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient C level hardware design for floating point biomedical DSP applications","publicationTitle":"13th IEEE International Conference on BioInformatics and BioEngineering","doi":"10.1109/BIBE.2013.6701691","displayPublicationTitle":"13th IEEE International Conference on BioInformatics and BioEngineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689795/6701519/06701691.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBE.2013.6701691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701519","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701691","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Efficient C level hardware design for floating point biomedical DSP applications","conferenceDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701691/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026329","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient C level hardware design for floating point biomedical DSP applications","confLoc":"Chania, Greece","sourcePdf":"82.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063974S","chronDate":"10-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689795","isNumber":"6701519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689795","xplore-issue":"6701519","articleId":"6701691","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6701756,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Tjikongo","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, University of the Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Tjikongo","id":"37086755884"},{"name":"Walter Uys","affiliation":["Department of Information Systems, University of the Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa"],"firstName":"Walter","lastName":"Uys","id":"37086757733"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-905824-38-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6701756","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Telecommunications","Companies","Computational modeling","Cities and towns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","small-to-medium enterprises","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing adoption","SMME","Namibia","computing paradigm","trustworthy data","customised data","data configuration","Internet","small medium and micro enterprises","technology adoption model version 3","ICT infrastructure","TAM factors","cloud computing services","IT resources flexibility","IT resources scalability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Technology Acceptance Model","Small medium and micro enterprises (SMME's)","Adoption","Developing countries","Namibia"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing has emerged as a new computing paradigm with the ability to provide trustworthy, customised and configurable data to any company or individual over the internet. Whilst gaining popular interest in developing countries and small, medium and micro enterprises (SMME's), the adoption factors have for the most part been unexplored. The purpose of this paper is to examine this particular aspect in Namibia. Questionnaires, based on the Technology Adoption Model version 3, were used and specifically targeted SMME's that have some form of ICT infrastructure. The relationships amongst the six TAM factors were tested. From the analysis it appears as if the primary reason respondents indicated for engaging with cloud computing services was to increase the flexibility and scalability of their IT resources. Reasons for not engaging with cloud services were unfamiliarity with the concept of cloud computing, unclear business models, risk of exposing corporate data, privacy concerns and high latency networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The viability of cloud computing adoption in SMME's in Namibia","publicationTitle":"2013 IST-Africa Conference & Exhibition","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IST-Africa Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693292/6701709/06701756.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701709","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 May 2013","displayDocTitle":"The viability of cloud computing adoption in SMME's in Namibia","conferenceDate":"29-31 May 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701756/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"14028111","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The viability of cloud computing adoption in SMME's in Namibia","confLoc":"Nairobi, Kenya","sourcePdf":"ISTAfricaFinalPaperref100IEEE.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0561S","chronDate":"29-31 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693292","isNumber":"6701709","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693292","xplore-issue":"6701709","articleId":"6701756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"The Authors","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6701811,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Wung","affiliation":["Center for Signal and Image Processing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Wung","id":"37642304400"},{"name":"Ted S.

In this paper, a limit on the maximum number of separable sources is derived beyond which the problem becomes rank deficient. This study reveals the number of sources that can be separated simultaneously is related to the order of the beam patterns. Further, using the principles of cylindrical mode beamforming, the performance can be predicted as a function of frequency. The result is consistent with simulations in which the performance of separating music and speech sound sources was quantified.","doi":"10.1109/WASPAA.2013.6701836","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689475/6701802/06701836.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASPAA.2013.6701836","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Under-determined source separation based on power spectral density estimated using cylindrical mode beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Under-determined source separation based on power spectral density estimated using cylindrical mode beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701836/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701836/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14025910","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Under-determined source separation based on power spectral density estimated using cylindrical mode beamforming","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046299S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689475","isNumber":"6701802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689475","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6701802","articleId":"6701836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6701847,"authors":[{"name":"Jort F.

The depermutation of these clusters using some known techniques is then much easier than the original problem.

In this paper, we propose a method which bypasses the need to build separate sound models. Instead, non-negative dictionaries for the sound content and their annotations are learned in a coupled sense. In the testing stage, time activations of the sound dictionary columns are estimated and used to reconstruct annotations using the annotation dictionary. The method requires no separate training data for classes and in general very promising results are obtained using only a small amount of data.","doi":"10.1109/WASPAA.2013.6701861","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689475/6701802/06701861.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASPAA.2013.6701861","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sound event detection using non-negative dictionaries learned from annotated overlapping events","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701861/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Sound event detection using non-negative dictionaries learned from annotated overlapping events","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14035551","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6701861/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sound event detection using non-negative dictionaries learned from annotated overlapping events","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"57.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061913S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689475","isNumber":"6701802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689475","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6701802","articleId":"6701861","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":6701862,"authors":[{"name":"Maria E.

We evaluate our approach on an IEEE audio challenge dataset consisting of office sound events and provide a systematic comparison of the various building blocks of our approach to demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating certain dependencies in the model. The hierarchical hidden Markov model achieves an average frame-based F-measure recognition performance of 45.5% on a test dataset that was used to evaluate challenge submissions. We also show how the hierarchical model can be used as a meta-classifier, although in the particular application this did not lead to an increase in performance on the test dataset.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701862/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701862/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14025970","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical modeling using automated sub-clustering for sound event recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical modeling using automated sub-clustering for sound event recognition","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"58.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048288S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689475","isNumber":"6701802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689475","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6701802","articleId":"6701862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6701880,"authors":[{"name":"Azzedine Touazi","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Science and Technology Houari Boumedienne, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Azzedine","lastName":"Touazi","id":"37085399203"},{"name":"Mohamed Debyeche","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Science and Technology Houari Boumedienne, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Debyeche","id":"37399223600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0972-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-1168"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"}],"articleNumber":"6701880","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Polynomials","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Training","Bandwidth","Vectors","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","polynomial approximation","quantisation (signal)","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polynomial interpolation based scheme","distributed speech recognition system","low bit rate compression scheme","dimensionality reduction","mel frequency cepstral coefficients","polynomial least squares fitting","conventional vector quantization","polynomial coefficients"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed speech recognition","MFCC","ETSI-AFE","polynomial least squares fitting","vector quantization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a low bit-rate compression scheme in distributed speech recognition (DSR) system based on polynomial interpolation.

This paper investigates to what extent sound fields recreated by Higher-Order Ambisonics (HOA) can be used to evaluate the performance of spatially selective multi-microphone processing schemes (beamformers) inside complex acoustic environments. Two example schemes are considered: an adaptive directional microphone (ADM) and a contralateral suppression bilateral beamformer (BBF), both implemented in the context of a hearing aid device. The acoustic scenarios consist of a single speech target (0\u00b0) competing against three speech jammers (\u00b190\u00b0 and 180\u00b0) set either in an anechoic or in a reverberant simulated classroom (T\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">30</sub>\n = 0.6s). The HOA effect on the directional algorithm performance is quantified through: (a) the adaptive, frequency-dependent, algorithm gains, (b) the SNR improvement calculated in one-third octave bands, and (c) the processed target frequency response. The HOA reconstruction errors influence the beamformers in mainly two ways; first, by altering the spatial characteristics of the sound field, which in turn modifies the adaptation of the algorithms, and second, by affecting the spectral content of the sources. The results suggest that although HOA (here 7\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n order) does not degrade the broadband, long-term, intelligibility-weighted SNR improvement of the two beamformers, it imposes a low-pass effect on the processed target. This renders the HOA coding problematic above the system's cut-off frequency.","doi":"10.1109/WASPAA.2013.6701882","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689475/6701802/06701882.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701802","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASPAA.2013.6701882","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of higher-order ambisonics on evaluating beamformer benefit in realistic acoustic environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6701882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Effect of higher-order ambisonics on evaluating beamformer benefit in realistic acoustic environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701882/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701882/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14025941","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of higher-order ambisonics on evaluating beamformer benefit in realistic acoustic environments","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057107S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689475","isNumber":"6701802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689475","xplore-issue":"6701802","articleId":"6701882","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6701887,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Oxnard","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Audio Lab, York, UK"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Oxnard","id":"37086766629"},{"name":"Damian Murphy","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, Audio Lab, York, UK"],"firstName":"Damian","lastName":"Murphy","id":"37273044600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0972-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-1168"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1947-1629"}],"articleNumber":"6701887","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Three-dimensional displays","Acoustics","Solid modeling","Numerical models","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","acoustic wave propagation","finite difference time-domain analysis","geometry","signal synthesis","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["room impulse response synthesis","2D multiplane FDTD hybrid acoustic model","3D geometric modeling techniques","2D numerical modeling techniques","multiple 2D finite difference time domain schemes","low-frequency sound wave propagation simulation","hybrid RIR synthesis","run-time reduction","3D simulation","complementary assimilation"]}],"abstract":"This paper exposes, and analyzes the validity of, a novel hybrid acoustic modeling system created through complementary assimilation of 3D geometric and 2D numerical modeling techniques.

In particular, sparse feature learning algorithms have shown that they can not only discover meaningful structures from raw data but also outperform many hand-engineered features. In this paper, we apply the sparse feature learning approach to acoustic scene classification. We use a sparse restricted Boltzmann machine to capture manyfold local acoustic structures from audio data and represent the data in a high-dimensional sparse feature space given the learned structures. For scene classification, we summarize the local features by pooling over audio scene data. While the feature pooling is typically performed over uniformly divided segments, we suggest a new pooling method, which first detects audio events and then performs pooling only over detected events, considering the irregular occurrence of audio events in acoustic scene data. We evaluate the learned features on the IEEE AASP Challenge development set, comparing them with a baseline model using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). The results show that learned features outperform MFCCs, event-based pooling achieves higher accuracy than uniform pooling and, furthermore, a combination of the two methods performs even better than either one used alone.","doi":"10.1109/WASPAA.2013.6701893","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WASPAA.2013.6701893","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689475/6701802/06701893.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic scene classification using sparse feature learning and event-based pooling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic scene classification using sparse feature learning and event-based pooling","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6701893/","accessionNumber":"14025945","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701893/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic scene classification using sparse feature learning and event-based pooling","confLoc":"New Paltz, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"86.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041966S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689475","isNumber":"6701802","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689475","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6701802","articleId":"6701893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6701894,"authors":[{"name":"Keisuke Kinoshita","affiliation":["NTT Corporation"],"firstName":"Keisuke","lastName":"Kinoshita","id":"37420926300"},{"name":"Marc Delcroix","affiliation":["NTT Corporation"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Delcroix","id":"37425994200"},{"name":"Takuya Yoshioka","affiliation":["NTT Corporation"],"firstName":"Takuya","lastName":"Yoshioka","id":"37410482600"},{"name":"Tomohiro Nakatani","affiliation":["NTT Corporation"],"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Nakatani","id":"37342222600"},{"name":"Emanuel Habets","affiliation":["Int.

This paper presents the implementation of a high speed oversampled single bit beamformer using three ADSP TigerSHARC TS201 processors. High-speed for single bit beamformer is achieved using vector based solution.

Most of the state of the art target recognition systems depend on hand engineered feature extraction schemes in order to effectively represent the target signatures, based on expert knowledge. Due to the whimsical nature of the sources and medium, such feature engineering methods often fail to yield invariant features from the observations. In this paper, a deep unsupervised feature learning approach capable of capturing invariant features from the sensory signal stream through multi layered hierarchical abstraction has been adopted. These abstractions learned by the higher layers are mostly invariant and can be used as the discriminative features for the purpose of classification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6701911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6701911/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14025655","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning architectures for underwater target recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning architectures for underwater target recognition","confLoc":"Kochi, India","sourcePdf":"ResearchSession1Paper08FinalPID2962557.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046751S","chronDate":"23-25 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6685221","isNumber":"6701901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6685221","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6701901","articleId":"6701911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"CUST","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6702010,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Fahim Ul Haque","affiliation":["Linkopings universitet, Linkoping, SE"],"firstName":"Muhammad Fahim","lastName":"Ul Haque"},{"name":"Ted Johansson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Ted","lastName":"Johansson","id":"37268124700"},{"name":"Dake Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Dake","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086733391"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1647-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6702010","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":368},"abstract":"This paper presents a novel power amplifier (PA) architecture based on the combination of radio frequency pulse width modulation (RFPWM) and multilevel PWM.

The model definition is based on binomial series, hence the name of memory binomial model (MBM). The MBM is here applied to measured data-sets acquired from an ET measurement set-up. When used as a PA model the MBM showed an NMSE (Normalized Mean Squared Error) as low as -40dB and an ACEPR (Adjacent Channel Error Power Ratio) below -51 dB. The simulated predistortion results showed that the MBM can improve the compensation of distortion in the adjacent channel of 5.8 dB and 5.7 dB compared to a memory polynomial predistorter (MPPD).

According to simulations, at E-band frequencies, the power combiner consisting of two individual single turn transformers performs significantly better compared to a single common 2:1 transformer with two turns on the secondary side. The power combination allows for a low supply voltage of 1 V, which is beneficial since the supply can be shared between the power amplifier and the transceiver thereby eliminating the need of a separate voltage regulator. To improve the gain of the two-stage amplifier it employs a capacitive cross-coupling technique not yet seen in mm-wave SiGe PAs. The PA is designed in a SiGe process with fr = 200 GHz and achieves a power gain of 12dB, a saturated output power of 16dBm and a 14% peak PAE.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Circuit faults","Couplings","Silicon germanium","Capacitors","Power generation","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Ge-Si alloys","millimetre wave power amplifiers","power combiners","transceivers","transformers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["output power combination","single turn stacked transformer","transceiver","voltage regulator","two-stage E-band power amplifier","capacitive cross-coupling technique","mm-wave PA","voltage 1 V","frequency 81 GHz to 86 GHz","frequency 200 GHz","gain 12 dB","efficiency 14 percent","SiGe"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NORCHIP.2013.6702018","publicationTitle":"2013 NORCHIP","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 NORCHIP","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693155/6701993/06702018.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701993","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NORCHIP.2013.6702018","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1V SiGe power amplifier for 81\u201386 GHz E-band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 1V SiGe power amplifier for 81\u201386 GHz E-band","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702018/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702018/","accessionNumber":"14027874","conferenceDate":"11-12 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Nov. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1V SiGe power amplifier for 81\u201386 GHz E-band","confLoc":"Vilnius, Lithuania","sourcePdf":"22414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06135S","chronDate":"11-12 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693155","isNumber":"6701993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693155","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6701993","articleId":"6702018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6702022,"authors":[{"name":"Pekka Ker\u00e4nen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"Ker\u00e4nen","id":"37833161500"},{"name":"Juha Kostamovaara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Juha","lastName":"Kostamovaara","id":"37273978100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1647-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6702022","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ring oscillators","Radiation detectors","Clocks","Switches","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","CMOS integrated circuits","electric noise measurement","integrated circuit measurement","integrated circuit noise","measurement errors","oscillators","phase noise","time-digital conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TDC","ring oscillator","switching oscillation frequency","cyclic-algorithmic ADC","quantization error amplification","recursive quantization","phase noise","standard CMOS process","calibration","noise induced measurement error","algorithmic time-to-digital converter","size 0.35 mum","time 0.3 ps"]}],"abstract":"A novel time-to-digital converter is proposed.

The TGC also acts as a voltage to current converter with a peak to peak single-ended input voltage range of 1.8V and a ratio of single sided input current swing to bias current is close to 10. The total power consumption of the fully differential TGC is 100uA/channel. The beam former is a switched current delay line based design with 16 memory cells per channel. The highlight of the beam-former architecture is that the number of storage cells can be easily extended to a desirable value with the current consumption almost being constant. This provides a longer delay line and a higher flexibility for wave shaping during the beam formation. The current consumption of each channel is 422uA and there are total 16 channels for summation in the beam-former. The input signal frequency is 5MHz and the sampling frequency is 25MHz. This assembly achieves 60dB signal to noise ratio after the summation when the single sided signal amplitude is 600mV. The gain variation in the TGC is 20dB and the instantaneous dynamic range is 38dB hence the total dynamic range of the assembly is 58dB. The TGC and the beam-former are designed and simulated in 180nm technology. The total current consumption for the TGC and the beam former along with a bias generation and a digital controller is 8.3mA and occupies an active area of 1.3mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14027850","htmlLink":"/document/6702032/","conferenceDate":"11-12 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Low power front end electronics for in-probe beamforming in ultrasound imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low power front end electronics for in-probe beamforming in ultrasound imaging","confLoc":"Vilnius, Lithuania","sourcePdf":"36612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078617S","chronDate":"11-12 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693155","isNumber":"6701993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693155","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6701993","articleId":"6702032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6702034,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Granlund","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Granlund","id":"37086763679"},{"name":"Liang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37716629900"},{"name":"Chenxin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Chenxin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37710993800"},{"name":"Viktor Owall","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Viktor","lastName":"Owall","id":"37271343400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1647-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6702034","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","MIMO","Vectors","Throughput","Very large scale integration","Algorithm design and analysis","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","delays","energy consumption","MIMO communication","perturbation techniques","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["highly-parallel soft-output MIMO detector","fast node enumeration","soft-output signal detector","64-QAM MIMO system","high data-level parallelism","node perturbation technique","zero forcing","node enumeration scheme","CMOS technology","clock frequency","energy consumption","bit rate 3 Gbit/s"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a high throughput, low latency soft-output signal detector for a 4\u00d74 64-QAM MIMO system.

As TCXO (Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillator) frequency versus temperature stabilities have improved to ppb (part per billion) levels trim effect has become more of a concern. Even though unwanted, the degradation of performance from trim effect is something generally accepted as a characteristic of TCXOs. This paper focuses on a method of compensating crystal oscillator trim effect. Through the use of an artificial neural network, trim effect compensation of AT cut crystal oscillators can be achieved with better than +/-15ppb stability over the industrial temperature range (-40 to +85 \u00b0C). This is more than a 10 fold improvement over the inherent trim effect found using state of the art polynomial function generator compensation. The theory of this compensation method with be discussed, and data showing the results of trim effect compensation on actual oscillators will be presented.","doi":"10.1109/EFTF-IFC.2013.6702048","startPage":"963","endPage":"966","publicationTitle":"2013 Joint European Frequency and Time Forum & International Frequency Control Symposium (EFTF/IFC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EFTF-IFC.2013.6702048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6702044","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Joint European Frequency and Time Forum & International Frequency Control Symposium (EFTF/IFC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687306/6702044/06702048.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trim effect compensation using an artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702048/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Trim effect compensation using an artificial neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702048/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14025721","publicationDate":"July 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trim effect compensation using an artificial neural network","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013000056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030328S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6687306","isNumber":"6702044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6687306","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6702044","articleId":"6702048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6702107,"authors":[{"name":"J.-M Friedt","affiliation":["SENSeOR, Besan\u00e7on, France"],"firstName":"J.-M","lastName":"Friedt","id":"37294665800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0342-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0341-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6702107","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":379},"abstract":"The flexibility, reconfigurability and stability of software defined radio yield an attractive alternative to the analog strategy of probing acoustic transducers acting as passive sensors probed through a wireless link or to phase noise characterization of oscillators. However, developing processing blocks is a time consuming activity, yet metrology applications require a dedicated understanding of each processing step. We consider GNURadio as a means of exploiting opensource software as an optimum tradeoff between software re-usability yet compatible with an audit for assessing performance. This signal processing environment is demonstrated on two practical examples, FMCW probing of acoustic delay lines acting as sensors, and quartz tuning fork characterization. Both examples are considered as introductory setups for training and teaching yet a suitable environment for research activities.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Phase

A robust optical double pass interferometer setup is presented, allowing absolute phase and absolute magnitude measurements of the out-of-plane vibration component witin a 5 to 1200 MHz frequency range, only limited by the photodetector bandwidth. By using a dedicated high frequency demodulator, the system is insensitive to the low-frequency mechanical vibration. The system is here used on single-port Surface Acoustic Wave, allowing for the identification of energy distribution as a function of operating frequency and the acoustic velocity over the Bragg mirrors surrounding the resonator. We envision such an instrument as a tool for assessing acoustic energy confinement allowing for optimizing resonator quality factors aimed at providing improved frequency source stability.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6702044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EFTF-IFC.2013.6702188","publicationTitle":"2013 Joint European Frequency and Time Forum & International Frequency Control Symposium (EFTF/IFC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Joint European Frequency and Time Forum & International Frequency Control Symposium (EFTF/IFC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6687306/6702044/06702188.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"76","doi":"10.1109/EFTF-IFC.2013.6702188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Absolute phase and amplitude mapping of Surface Acoustic Wave fields","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-25 July 2013","displayDocTitle":"Absolute phase and amplitude mapping of Surface Acoustic Wave fields","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-25 July 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6702188/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2013","accessionNumber":"14025691","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702188/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Absolute phase and amplitude mapping of Surface Acoustic Wave fields","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"UFFC2013001314.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056681S","chronDate":"21-25 July 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6687306","isNumber":"6702044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6687306","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6702044","articleId":"6702188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6702242,"authors":[{"name":"Laura C.

After dry etching the 20 by 107 \u03bcm holes into the substrate an isolation and barrier seed films are deposited and then filled with copper. The electrical connection between the pad level of the processor chips and the interface to the external connections is realized with a two level redistribution wiring. Subsequently the wafer is flipped, temporary bonded to a carrier wafer, thinned and the TSVs are connected from the wafer backside. Finally the flash chips are assembled to the controller die using a die-to-wafer (D2W) technique. Electrical tests have been conducted and a high yield after TSV processing and assembly determined. The isolation properties and electrical resistance was measured. The linear current in stress transistors was used to define a keep out zone.","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2013.6702314","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6690582/6702313/06702314.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2013.6702314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6702313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D integration of standard integrated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"3D integration of standard integrated circuits","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14026730","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702314/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702314/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D integration of standard integrated circuits","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061405S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690582","isNumber":"6702313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690582","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6702313","articleId":"6702314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6702326,"authors":[{"name":"Jiacheng Wang","affiliation":["ERI@N, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jiacheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086718489"},{"name":"Shunli Ma","affiliation":["School of EEE, Nanyang Technological Univerisy, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shunli","lastName":"Ma","id":"37086718255"},{"name":"P.

It is seen that the yield of 3D SIC depends on interlayer vertical inter-connectors. Imperfection during the fabrication process results in yield-reducing manufacturing defects. Hence, identification of faulty TSVs and recovery of those faulty TSVs are necessary to improve the yield. In this paper, we have proposed a methodology to test the regular TSVs before bonding (pre-bonding) to identify the faulty TSVs uniquely in reduced test time. Our algorithm also performs better in terms of test time reduction than the previous works presented in the literature. This paper also has discussed the idea of recovery of faulty regular TSVs using redundant TSVs. For a given group ratio, the best possible multiple dependent regular TSVs can be achieved using our proposed scheme for redundancy.","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2013.6702339","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6690582/6702313/06702339.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6702313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2013.6702339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Faulty TSVs identification and recovery in 3D stacked ICs during pre-bond testing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Faulty TSVs identification and recovery in 3D stacked ICs during pre-bond testing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702339/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14026676","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702339/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Faulty TSVs identification and recovery in 3D stacked ICs during pre-bond testing","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051615S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690582","isNumber":"6702313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690582","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6702313","articleId":"6702339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6702341,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Uhrmann","affiliation":["EV Group, St. Florian am Inn, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Uhrmann","id":"37394992300"},{"name":"Thorsten Matthias","affiliation":["EV Group, St. Florian am Inn, Austria"],"firstName":"Thorsten","lastName":"Matthias","id":"37545979600"},{"name":"Markus Wimplinger","affiliation":["EV Group, St. Florian am Inn, Austria"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Wimplinger","id":"37542679600"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Burggraf","affiliation":["EV Group, St. Florian am Inn, Austria"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Burggraf","id":"37401692100"},{"name":"Daniel Burgstaller","affiliation":["EV Group, St. Florian am Inn, Austria"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Burgstaller","id":"38233759900"},{"name":"Harald Wiesbauer","affiliation":["EV Group, St. Florian am Inn, Austria"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Wiesbauer","id":"38263485200"},{"name":"Paul Lindner","affiliation":["EV Group, St. Florian am Inn, Austria"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Lindner","id":"37340522300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6484-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6702341","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":309},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bonding","Metrology","Silicon","Surfaces","Three-dimensional displays","Through-silicon vias"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adhesive bonding","infrared detectors","inspection","integrated circuit manufacture","optical instruments","three-dimensional integrated circuits","wafer bonding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thin wafer processing","3D integrated circuit","TSV","area consumption reduction","debonding technology","thin wafer handling","backside processing","nonreworkable process","metrology solution","quality relevant parameter","temporarily bonded stack","infrared based measurement principle","system design","wafer scanning","bonded wafer","temporary bonding system","3D stacked device manufactur","total thickness variation","size 20 mum to 50 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["temporary bonding","debonding","inline metrology","total thickness variation","uniformity","bonding voids"]}],"abstract":"The ability to process thin wafers with thicknesses of 20-50um on front- and backside is a key technology for 3D IC. The most obvious reason for thin wafers is the reduced form factor, which is especially important for handheld devices. However, probably even more important is that thinner wafers enable significant cost reduction for TSVs. The silicon real estate consumed by the TSVs has to be minimized in order that the final device provides a performance advantage compared to traditional 2D devices. The only way to reduce area consumption by the TSVs is to reduce their diameter. For a given wafer thickness the reduction of TSV diameter increases the TSV aspect ratio. Consensus has developed on the use of Temporary Bonding / Debonding Technology as the solution of choice for reliably handling thin wafers through backside processing steps. While the majority of the device manufacturing steps on the front side of the wafer will be completed with the wafer still at full thickness, it will be temporarily mounted onto a carrier before thinning and processing of the features on its backside. Once the wafer reaches the temporary bonding step, it already represents a significant value, as it has already gone through numerous processing steps. For this reason, inspection of wafers prior to non-reworkable process steps is of great interest. Within the context of Temporary Bonding this consideration calls for inline metrology that allows for detection of excursions of the temporary bonding process in terms of adhesive thickness, thickness uniformity as well as bonding voids prior to thinning of the product wafer. This paper introduces a novel metrology solution capable of detecting all quality relevant parameters of temporarily bonded stacks in a single measurement cycle using an Infrared (IR) based measurement principle. Thanks to the IR based measurement principle, the metrology solution is compatible with both silicon and glass carriers. The system design has been developed with the inline metrology task in mind. This has led to a unique system design concept that enables scanning of wafers at a throughput rate sufficient to enable 100% inspection of all bonded wafers inline in the Temporary Bonding system. Both, current generation temporary bonding system throughputs and future high volume production system throughputs as required by the industry for cost effective manufacturing of 3D stacked devices were taken into account as basic specifications for the newly developed metrology solution. Sophisticated software algorithms allow for making pass/ fail decisions for the bonded stacks and triggering further inspection, processing and / or rework. Actual metrology results achieved with this novel system will be presented and discussed. In terms of adhesive total thickness variation (TTV) of bonded wafers, currently achieved performance values for postbond TTV will be reviewed in light of roadmaps as required by high volume production customers.","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2013.6702341","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6690582/6702313/06702341.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2013.6702341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6702313","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent progress in thin wafer processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recent progress in thin wafer processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702341/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026705","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6702341/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent progress in thin wafer processing","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067588S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690582","isNumber":"6702313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690582","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6702313","articleId":"6702341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6702342,"authors":[{"name":"Vinod Pangracious","affiliation":["LIP6, University of Pierre and Marie Curie Paris VI, France"],"firstName":"Vinod","lastName":"Pangracious","id":"38550370300"},{"name":"Habib Mehrez","affiliation":["LIP6, University of Pierre and Marie Curie Paris VI, France"],"firstName":"Habib","lastName":"Mehrez","id":"37284092100"},{"name":"Zied Marakchi","affiliation":["FLEXRAS Technologies, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Zied","lastName":"Marakchi","id":"37070349500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6484-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6702342","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":171},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702342","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Field programmable gate arrays","Through-silicon vias","Integrated circuit interconnections","Delays","Stacking","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit interconnections","logic partitioning","network topology","three-dimensional integrated circuits","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D tree","butterfly programmable interconnect topology","CMOS technology scaling","3D mesh based FPGA","field programmable gate arrays","logic density","tree-based FPGA architecture","butterfly-fat-tree based network topology","BFT based network topology","programmable interconnect delay","Tezzaron technology","size 130 nm"]}],"abstract":"The CMOS technology scaling has greatly improved the overall performance and density of the Mesh-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), nonetheless the gap between FPGAs and ASICs in terms of logic density, speed and power consumption remains very wide mainly due the programming overhead.

This paper uses 3D-COSTAR, a tool that considers costs involved in the whole 2.5D/3D-SIC chain, including design, manufacturing, test, packaging and logistics, e.g. related to shipping wafers between a foundry and a test house; and provides the estimated overall cost for 2.5D/3D-SICs and its cost breakdown for a given input parameter set, e.g., test flows, die yield and stack yield. As a case study, the tool is used to evaluate the overall 2.5D-SIC cost for three test optimization problems: (a) the impact of the fault coverage of the pre-bond silicon interposer test, (b) the impact of pre-bond testing of active dies using either dedicated probe-pads or micro-bumps, and (c) the impact of mid-bond testing and logistics on the overall cost. The results show that for the selected parameters: (a) pre-bond testing of the interposer die is important for overall 2.5D-SIC cost reduction; the higher the fault coverage, the lower the overall cost, (b) using micro-bump probing results in much lower overall cost as compared to probe-pads, and (c) mid-bond testing can be avoided for high stacking yield.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702351/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14026743","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6702351/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using 3D-COSTAR for 2.5D test cost optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using 3D-COSTAR for 2.5D test cost optimization","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"50.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073378S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690582","isNumber":"6702313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690582","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6702313","articleId":"6702351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6702353,"authors":[{"name":"Caleb Serafy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, Maryland"],"firstName":"Caleb","lastName":"Serafy","id":"37085386931"},{"name":"Bing Shi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, Maryland"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Shi","id":"37895754500"},{"name":"Ankur Srivastava","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, Maryland"],"firstName":"Ankur","lastName":"Srivastava","id":"37278954800"},{"name":"Donald Yeung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, Maryland"],"firstName":"Donald","lastName":"Yeung","id":"37270592300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6484-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6702353","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":356},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Random access memory","Cooling","Delays","Integrated circuits","Heating","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","DRAM chips","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit packaging","microfluidics","microprocessor chips","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D stacked DRAM processor architectures","microfluidic cooling","aggressive cooling","heat removal","thermal violations","design space","memory controllers","frequency scaling"]}],"abstract":"In this work we consider new 3D IC processor architectures that become feasible only when aggressive cooling is used. In traditional air cooled 3D processors, heat removal is a big issue, and so designers often pursue low performance architectures in order to prevent thermal violations. We attempt to explore the new design space that is available to computer architects when micro-fluidic cooling is applied to the 3D chip. We show that adding more memory controllers to a 3D processor can offer the potential for huge increases in performance, but also drastically increases the temperature of an uncooled chip, making them infeasible. With micro-fluidic cooling, these performance increases become realizable and new high performance architectures can be designed when cooling is co-designed with the architecture. We observe a 2.4x increase in average performance when comparing a 3D stacked memory processor with and without micro-fluidic cooling. This performance increase occurs because the cooling unlocks the possibility of adding more memory controllers as well as more aggressive frequency scaling. Cooling also improves the energy efficiency of the processors since a slight increase in cooling power helps to significantly reduce the leakage levels. This combined with improvements in performance due to aggressive cooling helps to increase energy efficiency on average 16.8x.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance 3D stacked DRAM processor architectures with micro-fluidic cooling","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2013.6702353","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2013.6702353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6702313","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6690582/6702313/06702353.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702353/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"High performance 3D stacked DRAM processor architectures with micro-fluidic cooling","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702353/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026719","conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance 3D stacked DRAM processor architectures with micro-fluidic cooling","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053006S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690582","isNumber":"6702313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690582","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6702313","articleId":"6702353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6702363,"authors":[{"name":"K.

To realize high speed, high resolution, and high sensitivity, we have proposed a blockparallel signal processing with 3-D structure. The block-parallel analog signal processing elements which compose CMOS image sensor, correlated double sampling (CDS) with programmable gain amplifier (PGA) array, and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) array. Spatial noise is the main contributor of image distortion in CMOS image sensor. Fixed pattern noise (FPN) does not change with time, and causes fixed distortion pattern on the image, hence FPN correction is especially challenging in the high speed CMOS image sensor. In the proposed sensor system, FPN of pixel output is removed by analog CDS. The digital CDS proposed in this paper is used to eliminate FPN caused by the device variation of analog circuits. The proposed ADC was designed with 90-nm CMOS technology.

It has attracted much research attention in recent years. Most of the previous research focuses on fitting circuit parameters to the frequency response obtained from measurements or full-wave discretization based electromagnetic simulations. The extension of these methods to multiple TSVs can be challenging because of the significant increase in computational cost. In this paper, we proposed a novel circuit model for multiple TSVs. Since frequent switching of high speed signals can dynamically bias TSV metal insulator semiconductor (MIS) interface and allocate TSV MIS into accumulation or depletion regions, the TSV capacitance is nonlinear and dependent on the biasing of the TSVs. An analytical expression for capacitance is introduced and a new circuit model is proposed accordingly. The circuit model accurately captures all the parasitic elements of various TSVs arrangements and accounts for wide frequency range, high frequency skin effect, eddy currents in substrate, and metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) effect.","doi":"10.1109/3DIC.2013.6702389","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International 3D Systems Integration Conference (3DIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6690582/6702313/06702389.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3DIC.2013.6702389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6702313","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel circuit model for multiple Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) in 3D IC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702389","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel circuit model for multiple Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) in 3D IC","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702389/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026744","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6702389/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel circuit model for multiple Through Silicon Vias (TSVs) in 3D IC","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"104.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059444S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690582","isNumber":"6702313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690582","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6702313","articleId":"6702389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6702397,"authors":[{"name":"Nyunyi M.

It has promising features, including non-volatile storage, byte addressability, fast read and write operations, and supports random accesses. However, there are challenges in designing algorithms for PCM-based memory systems, such as longer write latency and higher energy consumption compared to DRAM. In this paper, we propose a new predictive B\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n-tree index, called the B\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sup>\n-tree, which is tailored for database systems that make use of PCM. Our B\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sup>\n-tree reduces data movements caused by tree node splits and merges that arise from insertions and deletions. This is achieved by pre-allocating space on PCM for near future data. To ensure the space are allocated where they are needed, we propose a novel predictive model to ascertain future data distribution based on the current data. In addition, as in [4], when keys are inserted into a leaf node, they are packed but need not be in sorted order. We have implemented the B\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sup>\n-tree in PostgreSQL and evaluated it in an emulated environment. Our experimental results show that the Bp-tree significantly reduces the number of writes, therefore making it write and energy efficient and suitable for a PCM-like hardware environment.","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2014.5","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/6891519/06702416.pdf","startPage":"2368","endPage":"2381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2014.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6891519","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"---: A Predictive --- for Reducing Writes on Phase Change Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702416/","displayDocTitle":"<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf{B}^{p}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf{Tree}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>: A Predictive <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf{B}^{+}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf{Tree}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> for Reducing Writes on Phase Change Memory","volume":"26","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702416/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2014","accessionNumber":"14580135","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf{B}^{p}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf{Tree}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>: A Predictive <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf{B}^{+}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\mathsf{Tree}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> for Reducing Writes on Phase Change Memory","sourcePdf":"tkde-li-5-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104384S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6891519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6891519","articleId":"6702416","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6702428,"authors":[{"name":"Chunxiao Cai","affiliation":["People's Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, College of Communications Engineering, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6755552/6702428/6702428-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chunxiao Cai received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in communications and information systems from the People's Liberation Army University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2013.

Thus, whether or not one should use relay transmission for secure communication is an interesting and important problem. In this paper, we consider the transmission of a confidential message from a source to a destination in a decentralized wireless network in the presence of randomly distributed eavesdroppers. The source-destination pair can be potentially assisted by randomly distributed relays. For an arbitrary relay, we derive exact expressions of secure connection probability for both colluding and noncolluding eavesdroppers. We further obtain lower bound expressions on the secure connection probability, which are accurate when the eavesdropper density is small. Using these lower bound expressions, we propose a relay selection strategy to improve the secure connection probability. By analytically comparing the secure connection probability for direct transmission and relay transmission, we address the important problem of whether or not to relay and discuss the condition for relay transmission in terms of the relay density and source-destination distance. These analytical results are accurate in the small eavesdropper density regime.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2013.2297835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/6755552/06702428.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2013.2297835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6755552","startPage":"624","endPage":"632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"When Does Relay Transmission Give a More Secure Connection in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"When Does Relay Transmission Give a More Secure Connection in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks?","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702428/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14155810","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6702428/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"When Does Relay Transmission Give a More Secure Connection in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks?","sourcePdf":"tifs-cai-2297835-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089595S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6755552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6755552","articleId":"6702428","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6702430,"authors":[{"name":"Sangshin Kwak","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sangshin","lastName":"Kwak","id":"37273047100"},{"name":"Un-Chul Moon","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Un-Chul","lastName":"Moon","id":"37290406000"},{"name":"Jun-Cheol Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jun-Cheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37085336470"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8993"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0107"}],"articleNumber":"6702430","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":119,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2058},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-pels.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductance","Reactive power","Voltage measurement","Current measurement","Inductance measurement","Resistance","Electrical resistance measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","adaptive estimation","electric current control","least squares approximations","parameter estimation","power control","power electronics","power factor","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive-control-based direct power control","improved AFE performance","DPC","adaptive online parameter identification technique","AC-DC active front end","parameter uncertainty","least-square estimation","input inductance","input resistance","sampled input current","sampled input voltage","online-tuned input inductance","online-tuned input resistance","sensor","sinusoidal input current generation","unity power factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ac\u2013dc active front end","direct power control","online parameter identification","predictive control"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes predictive-control-based direct power control (DPC) with an adaptive online parameter identification technique for ac-dc active front ends (AFEs) to overcome model mismatch and parameter uncertainty.

Coil misalignment leads the primary coil driver to operate in an untuned state which causes nonoptimum switching operation and results in an increase in switching losses. This paper presents a novel method to electronically tune a Class-E inverter used as a primary coil driver in an inductive WPT system to minimize the detrimental effects of misalignment between the inductively coupled coils which may occur during operation. The tuning method uses current-controlled inductors (saturable reactors) and a variable switching frequency to achieve optimum switching conditions regardless of the misalignment. Mathematical analysis is performed on a Class-E inverter based on an improved model of a resonant inductive link. Experimental results are presented to confirm the analysis approach and the suitability of the proposed tuning method.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2297993","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6850100/06702433.pdf","startPage":"5975","endPage":"5982","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2297993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6850100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electronic Tuning of Misaligned Coils in Wireless Power Transfer Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702433/","displayDocTitle":"Electronic Tuning of Misaligned Coils in Wireless Power Transfer Systems","volume":"29","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14429985","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702433/","dateOfInsertion":"08 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electronic Tuning of Misaligned Coils in Wireless Power Transfer Systems","sourcePdf":"tpel-luk-2297993-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07099S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6850100","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"6850100","articleId":"6702433","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6702437,"authors":[{"name":"Roghayeh Saeidi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Roghayeh","lastName":"Saeidi","id":"37686686700"},{"name":"Mohammad Sharifkhani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Sharifkhani","id":"37273251200"},{"name":"Khosrow Hajsadeghi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Khosrow","lastName":"Hajsadeghi","id":"37706156900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6702437","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1415},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Circuit stability","SRAM cells","Leakage currents","Stability criteria"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","integrated circuit design","Monte Carlo methods","network topology","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subthreshold symmetric SRAM cell","read stability","differential eight-transistor static random access memory cell","symmetric topology","area overhead","read operation","cell storage nodes","read operation path","cell data stability","read operation delay","postlayout Monte Carlo","CMOS technology","read noise margin","write noise margin","conventional six-transistor cell","conventional 6T SRAM cell area","size 45 nm","voltage 92 mV","voltage 74 mV","voltage 0.35 V","voltage 18 mV","voltage 27 mV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data stability","iso-area analysis","subthreshold static random access memory (SRAM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702437","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/6710266/06702437.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2013.2291064","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2013.2291064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6710266","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Subthreshold Symmetric SRAM Cell With High Read Stability","abstract":"This brief introduces a differential eight-transistor static random access memory (SRAM) cell for subthreshold SRAM applications.

In this network, each user sends a multicast message to all other users while receiving K-1 independent messages from the other users via an intermediate relay. This network information flow is termed a MIMO Gaussian K-way relay channel. For this channel, it is shown that the optimal sum degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) is KM/K-1, assuming that all nodes have global channel knowledge and operate in full-duplex. A converse argument is derived by cut-set bounds. The achievability is shown by a repetition coding scheme with random beamforming in encoding and a zero-forcing method combined with self-interference cancelation in decoding. Furthermore, under the premise that all nodes have local channel state information at the receiver only and operate in half-duplex mode, it is shown that a total K/2 DoF is achievable when M=K-1. The key to showing this result is a novel encoding and decoding scheme, which creates a set of network code messages with a chain structure during the multiple access phase and performs successive interference cancelation using side-information for the broadcast phase. One major implication of the derived results is that efficient exploitation of the transmit message as side-information leads to an increase in the sum-DoF gain in a multiway relay channel with multicast messages.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2298138","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6739111/06702445.pdf","startPage":"1814","endPage":"1821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2298138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6739111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Degrees of Freedom for a MIMO Gaussian --Way Relay Channel: Successive Network Code Encoding and Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702445","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702445/","displayDocTitle":"Degrees of Freedom for a MIMO Gaussian <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$K$</tex> </formula>-Way Relay Channel: Successive Network Code Encoding and Decoding","volume":"60","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14096802","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702445/","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Degrees of Freedom for a MIMO Gaussian <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$K$</tex> </formula>-Way Relay Channel: Successive Network Code Encoding and Decoding","sourcePdf":"tit-lee-2298138-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.272939S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6739111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6739111","articleId":"6702445","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6702446,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang He","affiliation":["Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Xiang He (S'08-M'10) received B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China in 2003 and 2006 respectively.

For Gaussian channels with secrecy constraints, however, efforts to date rely on Gaussian random codes. In this paper, we advocate that structure in random code generation is useful for providing secrecy as well. In particular, a Gaussian wiretap channel in the presence of a cooperative jammer is studied. Previously, the achievable secrecy rate for this channel was derived using Gaussian signaling, which saturated at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), owing to the fact that the cooperative jammer simultaneously helps by interfering with the eavesdropper, and hurts by interfering with the intended receiver. In this paper, a new achievable rate is derived through imposing a lattice structure on the signals transmitted by both the source and the cooperative jammer, which are aligned at the eavesdropper but remain separable at the intended receiver. We prove that the achieved secrecy rate does not saturate at high SNR for all values of channel gains except when the channel is degraded.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information

Recent breakthroughs in wireless energy transfer and rechargeable lithium batteries provide a promising alternative to power WSNs: mobile vehicles/robots carrying high volume batteries serve as mobile chargers to periodically deliver energy to sensor nodes. In this paper, we consider how to schedule multiple mobile chargers to optimize energy usage effectiveness, such that every sensor will not run out of energy. We introduce a novel charging paradigm, collaborative mobile charging, where mobile chargers are allowed to intentionally transfer energy between themselves. To provide some intuitive insights into the problem structure, we first consider a scenario that satisfies three conditions, and propose a scheduling algorithm, PushWait, which is proven to be optimal and can cover a one-dimensional WSN of infinite length. Then, we remove the conditions one by one, investigating chargers' scheduling in a series of scenarios ranging from the most restricted one to a general 2D WSN. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithms in energy usage effectiveness and charging coverage.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702450/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"64","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2015","accessionNumber":"14914320","htmlLink":"/document/6702450/","displayDocTitle":"Collaborative Mobile Charging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Collaborative Mobile Charging","sourcePdf":"tc-zhang-2297926-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107214S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"7031983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"7031983","articleId":"6702450","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6702458,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan Shi","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/6891519/6702458/6702458-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chuan Shi received the BS degree from the Jilin University in 2001, the MS degree from the Wuhan University in 2004, and the PhD degree from the ICT of Chinese Academic of Sciences in 2007.

However, in many scenarios, we need to measure the relatedness between objects with different types. With the surge of study on heterogeneous networks, the relevance measure on objects with different types becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we study the relevance search problem in heterogeneous networks, where the task is to measure the relatedness of heterogeneous objects (including objects with the same type or different types). A novel measure HeteSim is proposed, which has the following attributes: (1) a uniform measure: it can measure the relatedness of objects with the same or different types in a uniform framework; (2) a path-constrained measure: the relatedness of object pairs are defined based on the search path that connects two objects through following a sequence of node types; (3) a semi-metric measure: HeteSim has some good properties (e.g., selfmaximum and symmetric), which are crucial to many data mining tasks. Moreover, we analyze the computation characteristics of HeteSim and propose the corresponding quick computation strategies. Empirical studies show that HeteSim can effectively and efficiently evaluate the relatedness of heterogeneous objects.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6891519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/6891519/06702458.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2013.2297920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2013.2297920","startPage":"2479","endPage":"2492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HeteSim: A General Framework for Relevance Measure in Heterogeneous Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702458/","displayDocTitle":"HeteSim: A General Framework for Relevance Measure in Heterogeneous Networks","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702458/","volume":"26","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"14580138","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HeteSim: A General Framework for Relevance Measure in Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"tkde-shi-2297920-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112458S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6891519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"158","xplore-issue":"6891519","articleId":"6702458","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6702462,"authors":[{"name":"Changhong Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/6802372/6702462/6702462-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Changhong Zhao (S'12) received the B.S. degree in automatic control from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2010 and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena.","His research is on the dynamics, stability, and load-side control and optimization in power systems."]},"firstName":"Changhong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"38488477700"},{"name":"Ufuk Topcu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/6802372/6702462/6702462-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Ufuk Topcu (M'08) received the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2008.","He is a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.

We prove that the swing dynamics and the branch power flows, coupled with frequency-based load control, serve as a distributed primal-dual algorithm to solve OLC. We establish the global asymptotic stability of a multimachine network under such type of load-side primary frequency control. These results imply that the local frequency deviations on each bus convey exactly the right information about the global power imbalance for the loads to make individual decisions that turn out to be globally optimal. Simulations confirm that the proposed algorithm can rebalance power and resynchronize bus frequencies after a disturbance with significantly improved transient performance.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2014.2298140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/6802372/06702462.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2014.2298140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6802372","startPage":"1177","endPage":"1189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Stability of Load-Side Primary Frequency Control in Power Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Stability of Load-Side Primary Frequency Control in Power Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702462/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14239227","dateOfInsertion":"18 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6702462/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Stability of Load-Side Primary Frequency Control in Power Systems","sourcePdf":"tac-zhao-2298140-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100872S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6802372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"270","xplore-issue":"6802372","articleId":"6702462","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6702465,"authors":[{"name":"Kaustubh Joshi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Kaustubh","lastName":"Joshi","id":"38347046900"},{"name":"Subhadeep Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Subhadeep","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"38466191600"},{"name":"Nilesh Goel","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Nilesh","lastName":"Goel","id":"38552389600"},{"name":"Nirmal Nanware","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Nirmal","lastName":"Nanware","id":"37086630811"},{"name":"Souvik Mahapatra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Souvik","lastName":"Mahapatra","id":"37272724100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"6702465","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":682},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Logic gates","Stress","Data models","Silicon","Insulators","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hole traps","MOSFET","negative bias temperature instability","semiconductor device models","semiconductor device reliability","silicon compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gate insulator process dependence","negative bias temperature instability","NBTI","silicon oxynitride p-MOSFET","high-k metal gate p-MOSFET","analytical compact model","long time degradation","bulk oxide traps","hole trapping","HKMG device","SiON"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Charge pumping (CP)","DCIV","flicker noise","high-$k$ metal gate (HKMG)","negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) modeling","silicon oxynitride (SiON)","trap generation","trapping","$V_{T}$ shift"]}],"abstract":"Process impact of negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) is studied in silicon oxynitride (SiON) and high- k metal gate (HKMG) p-MOSFETs.

However, the NRS was originally designed to be a pixel-wise classifier which considers the spectral signature only while ignoring the spatial information at neighboring locations. Gabor features have currently been successfully applied for hyperspectral image analysis due to the ability to represent useful spatial information. In this paper, we mainly exploit the benefits of using spatial features extracted from a simple Gabor filter for the NRS classifier. The proposed Gabor-filtering-based classifier has been validated on several real hyperspectral datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly increases the classification accuracy compared to conventional pixel-wise classifiers as well as Gabor-filtering-based support vector machine and sparse-representation-based classification.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2295313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/6803891/06702466.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2295313","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6803891","startPage":"1012","endPage":"1022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gabor-Filtering-Based Nearest Regularized Subspace for Hyperspectral Image Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gabor-Filtering-Based Nearest Regularized Subspace for Hyperspectral Image Classification","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702466/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14251341","dateOfInsertion":"22 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gabor-Filtering-Based Nearest Regularized Subspace for Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"jstars-du-2295313-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084851S","chronDate":"April  2014","isNumber":"6803891","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"112","articleId":"6702466","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6702468,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Roethlingshoefer","affiliation":["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Roethlingshoefer","id":"37319363900"},{"name":"Georgy Onishchukov","affiliation":["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Georgy","lastName":"Onishchukov","id":"37270589800"},{"name":"Bernhard Schmauss","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave Technology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Schmauss","id":"38524667900"},{"name":"Gerd Leuchs","affiliation":["University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Leuchs","id":"37266453300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6702468","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":479},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber amplifiers","Phase noise","Optical fiber couplers","Bit error rate","Optical noise","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","mirrors","optical fibre communication","optical modulation","optical repeaters","phase noise","quadrature amplitude modulation","superradiance","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude regeneration","phase regeneration","amplitude noise reduction","phase noise reduction","multiple signal states","nonlinear amplifying loop mirror","integrated directional phase-sensitive amplifier","star-eight quadrature amplitude modulation transmission format","amplified spontaneous emission","nonlinear phase noise","bit error rate","fiber launch power","high-power states","low-power states"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["All-optical signal processing","nonlinear amplifying loop mirror","QAM","phase-sensitive amplification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702468","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2013.2297171","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2013.2297171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6742736","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/6742736/06702468.pdf","startPage":"556","endPage":"559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-Optical Simultaneous Multilevel Amplitude and Phase Regeneration","abstract":"Simultaneous amplitude and phase noise reduction of multiple signal states using a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror with integrated directional phase-sensitive amplifier are presented for the star-eight quadrature amplitude modulation transmission format as an example.

This data often takes the form of a temporally evolving graph, where entities are the vertices and the interactions between them are the edges. An important feature of this graph is that the number of edges it has grows continuously, as new interactions take place. We call such graphs interaction graphs. In this paper we study the problem of storing interaction graphs such that temporal queries on them can be answered efficiently. Since interaction graphs are append-only and edges are added continuously, traditional graph layout and storage algorithms that are batch based cannot be applied directly. We present the design and implementation of a system that caches recent interactions in memory, while quickly placing the expired interactions to disk blocks such that those edges that are likely to be accessed together are placed together. We develop live block formation algorithms that are fast, yet can take advantage of temporal and spatial locality among the edges to optimize the storage layout with the goal of improving query performance. We evaluate the system on synthetic as well as real-world interaction graphs, and show that our block formation algorithms are effective for answering temporal neighborhood queries on the graph. Such queries form a foundation for building more complex online and offline temporal analytics on interaction graphs.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/69/6915958/06702469.pdf","startPage":"2689","endPage":"2702","doi":"10.1109/TKDE.2013.2297930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2013.2297930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6915958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disk-Based Management of Interaction Graphs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702469/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Disk-Based Management of Interaction Graphs","htmlLink":"/document/6702469/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14648350","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disk-Based Management of Interaction Graphs","sourcePdf":"tkde-gedik-2297930-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121555S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"69","isNumber":"6915958","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"69","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6915958","articleId":"6702469","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6702470,"authors":[{"name":"Denny Lie","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6729070/6702470/6702470-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Denny Lie (S'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include low-power multicore 3-D integrated system."]},"firstName":"Denny","lastName":"Lie","id":"37076444700"},{"name":"Kwanyeob Chae","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503870/6729070/6702470/6702470-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Kwanyeob Chae (S'09) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2013.","He joined Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Suwon, Korea, in 2000, where he was involved the development of digital circuits.

The effort and time required to ramp-up a system is largely dependent on the effectiveness of the human decision making process to select the most promising sequence of actions to improve the system to the required level of performance. Although existing work has identified significant factors influencing the effectiveness of ramp-up, little has been done to support the decision making during the process. This paper approaches ramp-up as a sequential adjustment and tuning process that aims to get a manufacturing system to a desirable performance in the fastest possible time. Production stations and machines are the key resources in a manufacturing system. They are often functionally decoupled and can be treated in the first instance as independent ramp-up problems. Hence, this paper focuses on developing a Markov decision process (MDP) model to formalize ramp-up of production stations and enable their formal analysis. The aim is to capture the cause-and-effect relationships between an operator's adaptation or adjustment of a station and the station's response to improve the effectiveness of the process. Reinforcement learning has been identified as a promising approach to learn from ramp-up experience and discover more successful decision-making policies. Batch learning in particular can perform well with little data. This paper investigates the application of a Q-batch learning algorithm combined with an MDP model of the ramp-up process. The approach has been applied to a highly automated production station where several ramp-up processes are carried out. The convergence of the Q-learning algorithm has been analyzed along with the variation of its parameters. Finally, the learned policy has been applied and compared against previous ramp-up cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6702489/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14516728","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"44","issue":"9","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An MDP Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach for Production Station Ramp-Up Optimization: Q-Learning Analysis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Commission as a part of the CP-FP 246083-2 IDEAS and CP-FP 229208-2 FRAME Project"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An MDP Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach for Production Station Ramp-Up Optimization: Q-Learning Analysis","sourcePdf":"tsmc-lohse-2294155-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075056S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"6878502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6878502","articleId":"6702489","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6702499,"authors":[{"name":"Yingzhe Hu","affiliation":["Princeton University, Princeton, NJ"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6777594/6702499/6702499-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yingzhe Hu (s'11) received the B.S. degrees in both physics and microelectronics from Peking University, China, in 2009, and the M.A. degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA, in 2011, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include thin-film circuit and CMOS IC hybrid sensing system design and analog and mixed signal design for sensing applications.","Mr. Hu is the recipient of a 2013 Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship, Gordon Wu award at Princeton University, and is 2013 ISSCC SRP outstanding poster winner."]},"firstName":"Yingzhe","lastName":"Hu","id":"38466287900"},{"name":"Liechao Huang","affiliation":["Princeton University, Princeton, NJ"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6777594/6702499/6702499-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Liechao Huang (s'12) received the B.S. degree in Microelectronics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2010 and the M.A. degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include thin-film circuit design for power, radio and sensing interfaces, CMOS analog and mixed signal design for sensing interfaces and power management and hybrid system design combining thin-film circuits and CMOS ICs.","Mr. Huang is the recipient of a 2010\u20132011 Princeton Fellowship."]},"firstName":"Liechao","lastName":"Huang","id":"38466425800"},{"name":"Warren S.

More realistic dc grid control strategies can thus be carefully considered in power flow analysis of ac/dc grids. Power flow methods for multi-terminal VSC-HVDC (MTDC) systems are analyzed for different types of dc voltage control techniques and the weaknesses of present methods are addressed. As distributed voltage control is likely to be adopted by practical dc grids, a new generalized algorithm is proposed to solve the power flow problems with various nonlinear voltage droops, and the method to incorporate this algorithm with ac power flow models is also developed. With five sets of voltage characteristics implemented, the proposed scheme is applied to a five-terminal test system and shows satisfactory performance. For a range of wind power variations and converter outages, post-contingency behaviors of the system under the five control scenarios are examined. The impact of these controls on the power flow solutions is assessed.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/6835113/06702505.pdf","startPage":"1721","endPage":"1730","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Flow Algorithms for Multi-Terminal VSC-HVDC With Droop Control","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2294198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6835113","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2294198","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702505/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2014","displayDocTitle":"Power Flow Algorithms for Multi-Terminal VSC-HVDC With Droop Control","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14396383","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6702505/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004714","fundingName":"National Grid"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000770","fundingName":"University of Manchester"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Flow Algorithms for Multi-Terminal VSC-HVDC With Droop Control","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wang-2294198-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056609S","chronDate":"July  2014","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"6835113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"6835113","articleId":"6702505","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6702513,"authors":[{"name":"Hawal Rashid","affiliation":["Group of Advanced Receiver Development (GARD), Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503871/6759772/6702513/6702513-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hawal Rashid received the M.Sc. degree in engineering physics from the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2010, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests are in low-noise and room-temperature terahertz (THz) systems, THz receiver component design, characterization, and calibration."]},"firstName":"Hawal","lastName":"Rashid","id":"37605381100"},{"name":"Denis Meledin","affiliation":["Group of Advanced Receiver Development (GARD), Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503871/6759772/6702513/6702513-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Denis Meledin received the Ph.D. degree in radiophysics from Moscow State Pedagogical University, Moscow, Russia, in 2003.","From 2000 to 2003, he was a Predoctoral Fellow with the Submillimeter Receiver Lab, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

With the advance of technologies, the performance of platoons can be further enhanced by vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). In the past few years, many studies have been conducted on the dynamics of a VANET-enabled platoon under traffic disturbance, which is a common scenario on a highway. However, most of them do not consider the impact of platoon dynamics on the behaviors of VANETs. Moreover, most existing studies focus on how to maintain the stability of a platoon and do not address how to mitigate negative effects of traffic disturbance, such as uncomfortable passenger experience, increased fuel consumption, and increased exhaust emission. In this paper, we will investigate the dynamics of the VANET-enabled platoon from an integrated perspective. In particular, we first propose a novel disturbance-adaptive platoon (DA-Platoon) architecture, in which a platoon controller shall adapt to the disturbance scenario and shall consider both VANET and platoon dynamics requirements. Based on a specific realization of the DA-Platoon architecture, we then analyze the traffic dynamics inside a platoon and derive desired parameters, including intraplatoon spacing and platoon size, so as to satisfy VANET constraints under traffic disturbance. To mitigate the adverse effects of traffic disturbance, we also design a novel driving strategy for the leading vehicle of a platoon, with which we can determine the desired interplatoon spacing. Finally, we conduct extensive simulation experiments, which not only validate our analysis but also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed driving strategy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A

Analysis of Spectrum Sharing Relay Systems With Multiple Secondary Destinations Under Primary User's Interference","abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the impact of multiuser diversity on the performance of secondary users (SUs) in dual-hop decode-and-forward (DF) spectrum sharing systems over Nakagami- $m$ fading channels, taking into consideration the interference from primary users (PUs). In particular, we present a detailed performance comparison for two different opportunistic scheduling algorithms, i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-based scheduling algorithm and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-based scheduling algorithm. For both scheduling algorithms, exact and asymptotic analytical expressions for the outage probability are derived. Our findings show that the SINR-based scheduling algorithm always outperforms the SNR-based scheduling algorithm. Nevertheless, when the number of destination is large, both scheduling algorithms attain almost the same outage performance, which suggests that, in such a scenario, the SNR-based scheduling algorithm is preferred because it requires less channel state information.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702521/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","volume":"63","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"14581668","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702521/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Outage Analysis of Spectrum Sharing Relay Systems With Multiple Secondary Destinations Under Primary User's Interference","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61172062, 61201229 and 61072044"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China","grantNumber":"BK2011116"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zheijiang Province","grantNumber":"LQ12F01006"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory of Southeast University","grantNumber":"2013D06"},{"fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund","grantNumber":"3-039-2-010"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Analysis of Spectrum Sharing Relay Systems With Multiple Secondary Destinations Under Primary User's Interference","sourcePdf":"tvt-huang-2297973-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070238S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6895341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6895341","articleId":"6702521","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6702523,"authors":[{"name":"Jiong Jin","affiliation":["Faculty of Science, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/6811169/6702523/6702523-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiong Jin (M\u201911) received the B.E. degree with First Class Honors in computer engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2006 and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia, in 2011.","Currently, he is a Lecturer in robotics and mechatronics, at the Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia.

The utilization of information and communications technologies to achieve this objective presents an opportunity for the development of smart cities, where city management and citizens are given access to a wealth of real-time information about the urban environment upon which to base decisions, actions, and future planning. This paper presents a framework for the realization of smart cities through the Internet of Things (IoT). The framework encompasses the complete urban information system, from the sensory level and networking support structure through to data management and Cloud-based integration of respective systems and services, and forms a transformational part of the existing cyber-physical system.

In order to dynamically direct traffic flows between respective network elements, Software Defined Networking (SDN) can be seen as one enabler. In this paper, we focus on mobile core network nodes such as the MME, HSS, S- and P- Gateway as standardized for the LTE Evolved Packet Core (EPC). One straightforward solution for a virtualized EPC architecture would be to move all EPC network nodes completely into a data center and handle the data traffic via SDN-enabled switches. However, this solution would keep the conventional monolithic architecture unchanged. A possible split in the EPC functionality between a centralized data center and operator's transport network elements could be needed to provide the desired flexibility, performance and TCO reduction. Therefore, we have analyzed the EPC nodes and classified their functions according to their impact on data-plane and control-plane processing. We propose a mapping for these functions on four alternative deployment frameworks based on SDN and OpenFlow (OF). In addition, we investigate the current OF implementation's capability to realize basic core operations such as QoS, data classification, tunneling and charging. Our analysis shows that functions, which involve high data packet processing such as tunneling, have more potential to be kept on the data-plane network element, i.e. realized by an OpenFlow Switch. We argue for an enhanced OF network element NE+, which contains additional network functions next to the basic OpenFlow protocol.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Virtual SDN-Enabled LTE EPC Architecture: A Case Study for S-/P-Gateways Functions","doi":"10.1109/SDN4FNS.2013.6702532","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE SDN for Future Networks and Services (SDN4FNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689496/6693160/06702532.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE SDN for Future Networks and Services (SDN4FNS)","startPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDN4FNS.2013.6702532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6693160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702532","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Control systems","Middleboxes","Resource management","Hardware","Software","IP networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internetworking","Long Term Evolution","protocols","quality of service","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OpenFlow Switch","OpenFlow protocol","charging operation","tunneling operation","quality of service","QoS","monolithic architecture","SDN-enabled switches","data traffic","virtualized EPC architecture","Long Term Evolution","evolved packet core","HSS gateway","MME gateway","mobile core network nodes","software defined networking","deployment flexibility","operational cost","network elements","data centers","control-plane function","data-plane processing","NFV","network functions virtualization","S-P-gateways functions","virtual SDN-enabled LTE EPC architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Virtual SDN-Enabled LTE EPC Architecture: A Case Study for S-/P-Gateways Functions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702532/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14026062","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Virtual SDN-Enabled LTE EPC Architecture: A Case Study for S-/P-Gateways Functions","confLoc":"Trento, Italy","sourcePdf":"pid1150354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042962S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689496","isNumber":"6693160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689496","citationCount":"107","xplore-issue":"6693160","articleId":"6702532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6702534,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan Ali-Ahmad","affiliation":["Orange, France"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Ali-Ahmad","id":"38274399100"},{"name":"Claudio Cicconetti","affiliation":["Intecs, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Cicconetti","id":"37399179200"},{"name":"Antonio de la Oliva","affiliation":["Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"de la Oliva","id":"37542281000"},{"name":"Vincenzo Mancuso","affiliation":["IMDEA Networks, Spain"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Mancuso","id":"38348713300"},{"name":"Malla Reddy Sama","affiliation":["Orange, France"],"firstName":"Malla Reddy","lastName":"Sama","id":"37085578770"},{"name":"Pierrick Seite","affiliation":["Orange, France"],"firstName":"Pierrick","lastName":"Seite","id":"37352767900"},{"name":"Sivasothy Shanmugalingam","affiliation":["Orange, France"],"firstName":"Sivasothy","lastName":"Shanmugalingam","id":"37589489900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2781-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6702534","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":71,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":2488},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Mobile radio mobility management","Mobile computing","Interference","IP networks","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","mobility management (mobile radio)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDN-based network architecture","extremely dense wireless networks","telecommunications networks","technology updates","mobile broadband wireless access","traffic increase","video transmission","cloud-based applications","CROWD project","mobile network operators","backhaul capacity","MAC control","mobility management","medium access control"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An SDN-Based Network Architecture for Extremely Dense Wireless Networks","abstract":"Telecommunications networks are undergoing major changes so as to meet the requirements of the next generation of users and services, which create a need for a general revised architectural approach rather than a series of local and incremental technology updates. This is especially manifest in mobile broadband wireless access, where a major traffic increase is expected, mostly because of video transmission and cloud-based applications. The installation of a high number of very small cells is foreseen as the only practical way to achieve the demands. However, this would create a struggle on the mobile network operators because of the limited backhaul capacity, the increased energy consumption, and the explosion of signalling.

We demonstrate the benefits of OFHIP compared to present use of SSL in enabling mobility, reducing the connection latency and improving the resilience to known TCP-level attacks.","doi":"10.1109/SDN4FNS.2013.6702540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDN4FNS.2013.6702540","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE SDN for Future Networks and Services (SDN4FNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689496/6693160/06702540.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE SDN for Future Networks and Services (SDN4FNS)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6693160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enabling Secure Mobility with OpenFlow","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Enabling Secure Mobility with OpenFlow","conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702540/","accessionNumber":"14026089","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702540/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enabling Secure Mobility with OpenFlow","confLoc":"Trento, Italy","sourcePdf":"pid1150378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064682S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689496","isNumber":"6693160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689496","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6693160","articleId":"6702540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6702546,"authors":[{"name":"Josep Batalle","affiliation":["Fundaci\u00f3 i2CAT, Distributed Applications and Networks Area (DANA), Barcelona"],"firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Batalle","id":"37085804556"},{"name":"Jordi Ferrer Riera","affiliation":["Fundaci\u00f3 i2CAT, Distributed Applications and Networks Area (DANA), Barcelona"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Ferrer Riera","id":"37086150762"},{"name":"Eduard Escalona","affiliation":["Fundaci\u00f3 i2CAT, Distributed Applications and Networks Area (DANA), Barcelona"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Escalona","id":"37402772300"},{"name":"Joan A.

NFV is theoretically applicable to any network function and aims at simplifying the management of heterogeneous hardware platforms. Using as a basis one of the network functions offered by network routers, this article presents the analysis, design, and the first implementation, in a virtualized manner, of the routing function. Considering the current co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6 and the possibilities brought into the arena by OpenFlow-enabled infrastructures, the article describes the design of the virtualized routing protocol, enabling a simple management and avoiding signaling messages overhead in the control plane level, and the different scenarios considered to validate the virtualized function. In essence, the manuscript describes one of the first implementations of the functional NFV concept, through the virtualization of the routing function over an OpenFlow network. The different scenarios validated in the article are used to demonstrate the applicability of the NFV-powered implementation proposed into actual production environments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Switches","Protocols","Ports (Computers)","Proposals","Virtualization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network management","Internet","protocols","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NFV","OpenFlow infrastructure","network function virtualization","routing function virtualization","network services","network functions","data centers","network nodes","virtual machine","heterogeneous hardware platform management","network routers","routing function","IPv4","IPv6","Internet protocol"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SDN4FNS.2013.6702546","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE SDN for Future Networks and Services (SDN4FNS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE SDN for Future Networks and Services (SDN4FNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689496/6693160/06702546.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6693160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDN4FNS.2013.6702546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Implementation of NFV over an OpenFlow Infrastructure: Routing Function Virtualization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702546","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Implementation of NFV over an OpenFlow Infrastructure: Routing Function Virtualization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702546/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702546/","accessionNumber":"14026078","conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Implementation of NFV over an OpenFlow Infrastructure: Routing Function Virtualization","confLoc":"Trento, Italy","sourcePdf":"pid1150394.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044072S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689496","isNumber":"6693160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689496","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6693160","articleId":"6702546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6702548,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

Traditionally, the concept of predefined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) has been utilized to establish QoS parameters. However, most state-of-the-art technologies in this area are both proprietary and inflexible. To this end, Software Defined Networking (SDN) has the potential to make network management tasks flexible, scalable, and an open platform to encourage innovation. In this paper, we present the design of PolicyCop, an open, flexible, and vendor agnostic QoS policy management framework targeted towards OpenFlow based SDN. PolicyCop provides an interface for specifying QoS SLAs and then exploits the control plane's API to enforce them. PolicyCop also monitors the network and autonomically readjusts network parameters to meet customer SLAs. We present experimental results to demonstrate PolicyCop's effectiveness in ensuring throughput, latency, and reliability guarantees.","doi":"10.1109/SDN4FNS.2013.6702548","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE SDN for Future Networks and Services (SDN4FNS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE SDN for Future Networks and Services (SDN4FNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689496/6693160/06702548.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDN4FNS.2013.6702548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6693160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PolicyCop: An Autonomic QoS Policy Enforcement Framework for Software Defined Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702548/","displayDocTitle":"PolicyCop: An Autonomic QoS Policy Enforcement Framework for Software Defined Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026086","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702548/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PolicyCop: An Autonomic QoS Policy Enforcement Framework for Software Defined Networks","confLoc":"Trento, Italy","sourcePdf":"pid1150398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06488S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689496","isNumber":"6693160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689496","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"6693160","articleId":"6702548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6702549,"authors":[{"name":"Wolfgang John","affiliation":["Ericsson"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"John","id":"38519304100"},{"name":"Konstantinos Pentikousis","affiliation":["EICT"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Pentikousis","id":"37271895100"},{"name":"George Agapiou","affiliation":["OTE Research"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Agapiou","id":"37697936500"},{"name":"Eduardo Jacob","affiliation":["University of the Basque Country"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Jacob","id":"37301650100"},{"name":"Mario Kind","affiliation":["Deutsche Telekom AG"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Kind","id":"37546223500"},{"name":"Antonio Manzalini","affiliation":["Telecom Italia"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Manzalini","id":"37304132700"},{"name":"Fulvio Risso","affiliation":["Politecnico di Torino"],"firstName":"Fulvio","lastName":"Risso","id":"37323701200"},{"name":"Dimitri Staessens","affiliation":["iMinds"],"firstName":"Dimitri","lastName":"Staessens","id":"37313013400"},{"name":"Rebecca Steinert","affiliation":["SICS"],"firstName":"Rebecca","lastName":"Steinert","id":"37658076000"},{"name":"Catalin Meirosu","affiliation":["Ericsson"],"firstName":"Catalin","lastName":"Meirosu","id":"37079280800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2781-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6702549","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":119,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":2681},"abstract":"Network Service Chaining (NSC) is a service deployment concept that promises increased flexibility and cost efficiency for future carrier networks. NSC has received considerable attention in the standardization and research communities lately. However, NSC is largely undefined in the peer-reviewed literature. In fact, a literature review reveals that the role of NSC enabling technologies is up for discussion, and so are the key research challenges lying ahead. This paper addresses these topics by motivating our research interest towards advanced dynamic NSC and detailing the main aspects to be considered in the context of carrier-grade telecommunication networks. We present design considerations and system requirements alongside use cases that illustrate the advantages of adopting NSC. We detail prominent research challenges during the typical lifecycle of a network service chain in an operational telecommunications network, including service chain description, programming, deployment, and debugging, and summarize our security considerations. We conclude this paper with an outlook on future work in this area.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE SDN for Future Networks and Services (SDN4FNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689496/6693160/06702549.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE SDN for Future Networks and Services (SDN4FNS)","doi":"10.1109/SDN4FNS.2013.6702549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDN4FNS.2013.6702549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6693160","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research Directions in Network Service Chaining","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Software","Security","Virtualization","Context","Middleboxes","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["research and development","telecommunication network management","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["research directions","network service chaining","NSC","service deployment concept","carrier networks","standardization","carrier-grade telecommunication networks","network service chain","service chain description","service chain programming","service chain deployment","service chain debugging","security considerations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702549/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Research Directions in Network Service Chaining","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702549/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026076","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research Directions in Network Service Chaining","confLoc":"Trento, Italy","sourcePdf":"pid1150358.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078486S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689496","isNumber":"6693160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689496","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"6693160","articleId":"6702549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6702551,"authors":[{"name":"Suneth Namal","affiliation":["Department of Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Suneth","lastName":"Namal","id":"37832584700"},{"name":"Ijaz Ahmad","affiliation":["Department of Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Ijaz","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37085508818"},{"name":"Andrei Gurtov","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Andrei","lastName":"Gurtov","id":"37320552400"},{"name":"Mika Ylianttila","affiliation":["Department of Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Mika","lastName":"Ylianttila","id":"37298828400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2781-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6702551","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1425},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702551","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load management","Wireless LAN","Handover","Resource management","Load modeling","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","resource allocation","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDN based inter-technology load balancing","software defined networking","flow admission control","5G network architecture","per-flow resource allocation","cellular network","network options","user preference","user prioroties","analytical model","load balancing algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we have followed the idea of exploiting inter-technology load balancing leveraged by flow admission control with software defined networking (SDN). By means of the highly flexible interfaces, SDN is simply effective in the 5G network architecture where load balancing and dynamic flow admission control are considered as essence of networking. In one hand, load balancing presented in this paper reveals a drastic reduction of unsatisfied-user percentage almost by five times while, on the other hand, it enhances per-flow resource allocation more than %. In addition, this proposal substantially off-loads the core-network, avoids over-utilizing the cellular network and reserves resources based on cut-off priority. Explicitly, it allows a certain degree of freedom to choose the network options based on user-preference and their priorities. Finally, we compare our load balancing algorithm leveraged by flow admission control with an analytical model to ensure the correctness and efficiency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6693160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDN4FNS.2013.6702551","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE SDN for Future Networks and Services (SDN4FNS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE SDN for Future Networks and Services (SDN4FNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689496/6693160/06702551.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/SDN4FNS.2013.6702551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SDN Based Inter-Technology Load Balancing Leveraged by Flow Admission Control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"SDN Based Inter-Technology Load Balancing Leveraged by Flow Admission Control","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6702551/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026082","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702551/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SDN Based Inter-Technology Load Balancing Leveraged by Flow Admission Control","confLoc":"Trento, Italy","sourcePdf":"pid1150380.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046438S","chronDate":"11-13 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689496","isNumber":"6693160","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689496","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6693160","articleId":"6702551","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6702553,"authors":[{"name":"Sandra Scott-Hayward","affiliation":["Centre for Secure Information Technolocy (CSIT), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland"],"firstName":"Sandra","lastName":"Scott-Hayward","id":"38300527300"},{"name":"Gemma O'Callaghan","affiliation":["Centre for Secure Information Technolocy (CSIT), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland"],"firstName":"Gemma","lastName":"O'Callaghan","id":"37086712594"},{"name":"Sakir Sezer","affiliation":["Centre for Secure Information Technolocy (CSIT), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland"],"firstName":"Sakir","lastName":"Sezer","id":"37085419015"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2781-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6702553","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":228,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":12122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Monitoring","Protocols","Proposals","Virtualization","Computer crime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SDN security","software-defined networking","network visibility","network device programmability","network operator","network intruder","SDN framework"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702553","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE SDN for Future Networks and Services (SDN4FNS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689496/6693160/06702553.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SDN4FNS.2013.6702553","doi":"10.1109/SDN4FNS.2013.6702553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6693160","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE SDN for Future Networks and Services (SDN4FNS)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sdn Security: A Survey","abstract":"The pull of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is magnetic.

While it provides useful business insights and improved market responsiveness, it also adds a computational burden to traditional online transaction processing (OLTP) systems. Analytics queries involve complex database operations such as sort, aggregation, and join that consume significant computational resources, and, when executed on the same system, may affect the performance of OLTP queries. In this paper, we try to address this issue by accelerating two such database operations, namely, projection and sort, using a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Our prototype is implemented on an Alter a Stratix V FPGA and achieves an order of magnitude speedup in the sort operation compared to baseline software. Furthermore, our prototype implements projection in parallel with other query operations on FPGA, thus completely eliminating the cost of projection without consuming any extra cycles on the FPGA. FPGA accelerated sort and projection have been integrated with our previous work on accelerating other query operations [1], making our analytics acceleration prototype on FPGA applicable to a wider variety of queries.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large Payload Streaming Database Sort and Projection on FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2013.21","startPage":"25","endPage":"32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2013.21","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6702563","publicationTitle":"2013 25th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 25th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6701516/6702563/06702576.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Large Payload Streaming Database Sort and Projection on FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702576/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14030221","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large Payload Streaming Database Sort and Projection on FPGAs","confLoc":"Porto de Galinhas, Brazil","sourcePdf":"2927a025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056869S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6701516","isNumber":"6702563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6701516","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6702563","articleId":"6702576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6702587,"authors":[{"name":"Al\u00e9cio Pedro Delazari Binotto","firstName":"Al\u00e9cio Pedro Delazari","lastName":"Binotto"},{"name":"Dionisio Doering","affiliation":["UFRGS - Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Dionisio","lastName":"Doering","id":"37573021600"},{"name":"Thorsten Stetzelberger","affiliation":["LBNL - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Thorsten","lastName":"Stetzelberger","id":"37086783174"},{"name":"Patrick McVittie","affiliation":["LBNL - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"McVittie","id":"38232239700"},{"name":"Sergio Zimmermann","affiliation":["LBNL - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Zimmermann","id":"37278330900"},{"name":"Carlos Eduardo Pereira","affiliation":["LBNL - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"Carlos Eduardo","lastName":"Pereira","id":"37265059100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2928-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2927-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6533"}],"articleNumber":"6702587","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":457},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Cameras","Graphics processing units","X-ray imaging","Vectors","Central Processing Unit","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","field programmable gate arrays","graphics processing units","image processing","scheduling","X-ray imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic scheduling framework","coprocessor","image transfer","post-processing analysis","synchrotron experiment","linear integration algorithm","on site X-ray image evaluation","scientific applications","specialist-purpose processing units","programmable processing units","general-purpose processing units","high-speed scientific cameras","X-ray image processing","FPGA system","GPU","CPU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPU","FPGA","High-speed x-ray cameras","Heterogeneous systems","Dynamic scheduling","Linear integration"]}],"abstract":"Currently, computers can be composed of different Processing Units (PUs) - general-purpose and also programmable and specialist-purpose. One of the goals for such heterogeneity is to improve applications' performance. Particularly, scientific applications can highly benefit from this kind of platform. They produce large amounts of data within several types of algorithms, and distinct PUs are an alternative to better execute such tasks. This work presents a new system box - composed of CPU, GPU, and FPGA - to carry on site X-ray image evaluations. It was firstly tested by evaluating the performance of a Linear Integration (LI) algorithm over the PUs. This algorithm is largely used by synchrotron experiments in which high-speed X-ray cameras produce extremely large amounts of data for post-processing analysis, which includes performing LI. In our experiments, LI execution was around 30x faster in FPGA compared to CPU, achieving a similar performance to GPU. Taking the end-to-end application, i.e., image transfer into memory, this rate increases to hundreds. Issues for using FPGAs as a co-processor under our dynamic scheduling framework is also discussed. Synthesizing times for LI when assigned to FPGA are still too long for dynamic scheduling, preventing online synthesizing of functions not designed a priori.","doi":"10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2013.1","publicationTitle":"2013 25th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 25th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6701516/6702563/06702587.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2013.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6702563","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CPU, GPU, FPGA System for X-Ray Image Processing Using High-Speed Scientific Cameras","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702587/","displayDocTitle":"A CPU, GPU, FPGA System for X-Ray Image Processing Using High-Speed Scientific Cameras","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702587/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14030246","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CPU, GPU, FPGA System for X-Ray Image Processing Using High-Speed Scientific Cameras","confLoc":"Porto de Galinhas, Brazil","sourcePdf":"2927a113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098645S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6701516","isNumber":"6702563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6701516","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6702563","articleId":"6702587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6702595,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Carlos Guimar\u00e3es Pedronette","firstName":"Daniel Carlos Guimar\u00e3es","lastName":"Pedronette","id":"37847502900"},{"name":"Ricardo da S.

In this scenario, the use of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems has emerged as a promising approach to support image searches. The objective of CBIR systems is to retrieve the most similar images in a collection, given a query image, by taking into account image visual properties such as texture, color, and shape. In these systems, the effectiveness of the retrieval process depends heavily on the accuracy of ranking approaches. Recently, re-ranking approaches have been proposed to improve the effectiveness of CBIR systems by taking into account the relationships among images. The re-ranking approaches consider the relationships among all images in a given dataset. These approaches typically demands a huge amount of computational power, which hampers its use in practical situations. On the other hand, these methods can be massively parallelized. In this paper, we propose to speedup the computation of the RL-Sim algorithm, a recently proposed image re-ranking approach, by using the computational power of Graphics Processing Units (GPU). GPUs are emerging as relatively inexpensive parallel processors that are becoming available on a wide range of computer systems. We address the image re-ranking performance challenges by proposing a parallel solution designed to fit the computational model of GPUs. We conducted an experimental evaluation considering different implementations and devices. Experimental results demonstrate that significant performance gains can be obtained. Our approach achieves speedups of 7x from serial implementation considering the overall algorithm and up to 36x on its core steps.","doi":"10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2013.19","pdfPath":"/iel7/6701516/6702563/06702595.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"183","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 25th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","publicationTitle":"2013 25th International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2013.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6702563","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Re-ranking Acceleration on GPUs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Image Re-ranking Acceleration on GPUs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14030233","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6702595/","conferenceDate":"23-26 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Re-ranking Acceleration on GPUs","confLoc":"Porto de Galinhas, Brazil","sourcePdf":"2927a176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093217S","chronDate":"23-26 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6701516","isNumber":"6702563","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6701516","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6702563","articleId":"6702595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6702612,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Liu","affiliation":["George Washington University"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Liu","id":"38581348200"},{"name":"Jung-Hee Seo","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University"],"firstName":"Jung-Hee","lastName":"Seo","id":"38581341800"},{"name":"Rajat Mittal","affiliation":["Johns Hopkins University"],"firstName":"Rajat","lastName":"Mittal","id":"38581360900"},{"name":"H.

We utilize a row-oriented matrix decomposition method to divide the banded linear system into several correlated sub-linear systems and solve them on multiple GPUs collaboratively. We design a number of GPU and MPI optimizations to speedup inter-GPU and inter-machine communications. We evaluate the solver on Poisson equation and advection diffusion equation as well as several other banded linear systems.

In recent years, a wide variety of computational sites have emerged with shared access to users. A user may not be able to complete a complex workflow at a single site. It is thus beneficial to run different tasks of a workflow on different sites. For such cases, judicious scheduling strategy is required in order to map tasks in the workflow to resources at multiple sites so that the workload is balanced among sites and the overhead is minimized in data transfer. The key challenge is that the data transfer rate among sites varies based on the network capacity and load. We propose a workflow scheduling technique that tackles the multi-site task distribution challenge by using data movement performance modeling. We applied this technique to schedule an earth observation science workflow over three sites. Executed via the Swift parallel scripting paradigm, we augmented its default schedule and improved the time-to-completion by up to 52%.","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2013.6702647","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2013.6702647","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689497/6702603/06702647.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6702603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-driven multisite workflow scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Model-driven multisite workflow scheduling","conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702647/","accessionNumber":"14026177","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702647/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-driven multisite workflow scheduling","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053223S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689497","isNumber":"6702603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689497","xplore-issue":"6702603","articleId":"6702647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6702651,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua Peraza","affiliation":["University of California, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Peraza","id":"38546768600"},{"name":"Ananta Tiwari","affiliation":["San Diego Supercomputer Center, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ananta","lastName":"Tiwari","id":"38468604600"},{"name":"Michael Laurenzano","affiliation":["San Diego Supercomputer Center, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Laurenzano","id":"37393241400"},{"name":"Laura Carrington","affiliation":["San Diego Supercomputer Center, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Carrington","id":"37393242500"},{"name":"William A.

Effectively utilizing the raw compute capacity made available by these systems, however, remains a challenge because it can require a substantial investment of programmer time to port and optimize code to effectively use novel accelerator hardware. In this paper we present a methodology for isolating and modeling the performance of common performance-critical patterns of code (so-called idioms) and other relevant behavioral characteristics from large scale HPC applications which are likely to perform favorably on Intel Xeon Phi. The benefits of the methodology are twofold: (1) it directs programmer efforts toward the regions of code most likely to benefit from porting to the Xeon Phi and (2) provides speedup estimates for porting those regions of code. We then apply the methodology to the stencil idiom, showing performance improvements of up to a factor of 4.7\u00d7 on stencil-based benchmark codes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689497/6702603/06702651.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2013.6702651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2013.6702651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6702603","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding the performance of stencil computations on Intel's Xeon Phi","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heating","Acceleration","Computational modeling","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Benchmark testing","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel processing","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stencil computations","code common performance-critical patterns","large scale HPC applications","Intel Xeon Phi","stencil idiom","stencil-based benchmark codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702651/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Understanding the performance of stencil computations on Intel's Xeon Phi","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702651/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026144","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding the performance of stencil computations on Intel's Xeon Phi","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05055S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689497","isNumber":"6702603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689497","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6702603","articleId":"6702651","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6702657,"authors":[{"name":"K.

However, not all data is accessed at the same time or rate. Thus, if a large replication factor is used to support higher throughput for popular data, it wastes storage by unnecessarily replicating unpopular data as well. Conversely, if less replication is used to conserve storage for the unpopular data, it means fewer replicas for even popular data and thus lower I/O throughput. We present AptStore, a dynamic data management system for Hadoop, which aims to improve overall I/O throughput while reducing storage cost. We design a tiered storage that uses the standard DAS for popular data to sustain high I/O throughput, and network-attached enterprise filers for cost-effective, fault-tolerant, but lower-throughput storage for unpopular data. We design a file Popularity Predictor (PP) that analyzes file system audit logs and predicts the appropriate storage policy of each file, as well as use the information for transparent data movement between tiers. Our evaluation of AptStore on a real cluster shows 21.3% improvement in application execution time over standard Hadoop, while trace driven simulations show 23.7% increase in read throughput and 43.4% reduction in the storage capacity requirement of the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6702657/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14026133","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"AptStore: Dynamic storage management for hadoop","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AptStore: Dynamic storage management for hadoop","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07083S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689497","isNumber":"6702603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689497","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6702603","articleId":"6702657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6702676,"authors":[{"name":"Manjunath Gorentla Venkata","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Manjunath Gorentla","lastName":"Venkata","id":"37573299600"},{"name":"Pavel Shamis","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Pavel","lastName":"Shamis","id":"37393092200"},{"name":"Rahul Sampath","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Sampath","id":"38574208200"},{"name":"Richard L.

These operations are the most widely used abstractions to perform mathematical operations over all processes that are part of the simulation. In this work, we propose a hierarchical design to implement the reduction operations on multicore systems. This design aims to improve the efficiency of reductions by 1) tailoring the algorithms and customizing the implementations for various communication mechanisms in the system 2) providing the ability to configure the depth of hierarchy to match the system architecture, and 3) providing the ability to independently progress each of this hierarchy. Using this design, we implement MPI_Allreduce and MPI_Reduce operations (and its nonblocking variants MPI_Iallreduce and MPI_Ireduce) for all message sizes, and evaluate on multiple architectures including InfiniBand and Cray XT5. We leverage and enhance our existing infrastructure, Cheetah, which is a framework for implementing hierarchical collective operations to implement these reductions. The experimental results show that the Cheetah reduction operations outperform the production-grade MPI implementations such as Open MPI default, Cray MPI, and MVAPICH2, demonstrating its efficiency, flexibility and portability. On Infini-Band systems, with a microbenchmark, a 512-process Cheetah nonblocking Allreduce and Reduce achieves a speedup of 23x and 10x, respectively, compared to the default Open MPI reductions. The blocking variants of the reduction operations also show similar performance benefits. A 512-process nonblocking Cheetah Allreduce achieves a speedup of 3x, compared to the default MVAPICH2 Allreduce implementation. On a Cray XT5 system, a 6144-process Cheetah Allreduce outperforms the Cray MPI by 145%. The evaluation with an application kernel, Conjugate Gradient solver, shows that the Cheetah reductions speeds up total time to solution by 195%, demonstrating the potential benefits for scientific simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689497/6702603/06702676.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)","doi":"10.1109/CLUSTER.2013.6702676","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2013.6702676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6702603","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing blocking and nonblocking reduction operations for multicore systems: Hierarchical design and implementation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schedules","Sockets","Multicore processing","Engines","Semantics","Kernel","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message passing","multiprocessing systems","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blocking reduction operations","nonblocking reduction operations","multicore systems","hierarchical design","message passing interface","MPI programming model","reduction collective operations","MPI_Allreduce operation","MPI_Reduce operation","communication mechanisms","MPI_Iallreduce operation","MPI_Ireduce operation","message size","InfiniBand","Cray XT5","Cheetah infrastructure","Open MPI reductions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MPI","Collectives","HPC","Allreduce","Reduce"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing blocking and nonblocking reduction operations for multicore systems: Hierarchical design and implementation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702676/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026124","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing blocking and nonblocking reduction operations for multicore systems: Hierarchical design and implementation","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"78.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068829S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689497","isNumber":"6702603","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689497","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6702603","articleId":"6702676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6702710,"authors":[{"name":"Amado Guti\u00e9rrez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Metropolitan Autonomous University, Mexico City, Mexico"],"firstName":"Amado","lastName":"Guti\u00e9rrez","id":"37086741065"},{"name":"Gerardo Laguna","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Metropolitan Autonomous University, Mexico City, Mexico"],"firstName":"Gerardo","lastName":"Laguna","id":"37697438500"},{"name":"Paulino Mendoza","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Metropolitan Autonomous University, Mexico City, Mexico"],"firstName":"Paulino","lastName":"Mendoza","id":"37086741102"},{"name":"Victor Rangel","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications Engineering, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Rangel","id":"37689025300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2370-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6702710","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":366},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Modulation","Radio frequency","Vectors","Algorithm design and analysis","Baseband","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio","OFDM modulation","software radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physical level design","OFDM radio","software defined radio platform","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","digital communication algorithms","SDR platform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless communication","SDR","USRP","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"Currently the pressure of technological advances requires developers to reduce the design cycle and development time.

In this article a novel hybrid Bees Algorithm is proposed to optimizes the performance of a Fuzzy classification while the limited raw input data as the features are used. In this model, the proposed Bees Algorithm simulates the honey bees behaviour in the offspring generation process called Bee Royalty Offspring Algorithm (BROA) to improve the training process of classic Genetic Algorithm.

This is because the signals transmitted by two users arrive at the relay with varied amplitudes and a relative carrier-phase offset, which will impair the performance of PNC. This paper studies a linear PNC scheme for fading two-way relay channels where the transmitters lack the channel state information. In this scheme, the relay computes and broadcast some finite-set integer combinations of two users' messages. The coefficients for the integer combinations used at the relay are carefully designed to minimize the error probability. This scheme can be viewed as a practical embodiment of the compute-and-forward concept. We develop a new LPNC design criterion called minimum set-distance maximization. Using this criterion, we derive an explicit expression for the optimized integer coefficients that minimizes the error probability of LPNC. The optimized integer coefficients turn out to resemble the fading channel coefficients. We further derive a closed-form expression on the average error probability performance over a complex-valued Rayleigh fading two-way relay channel, which shows that our designed LPNC scheme approaches the optimal error performance at a high SNR.

However, it is a batch mode which may not be so efficient in terms of computational complexity for slowly time-varying channel environments. The solution of the current frame can be obtained with slight modification from that of the previous frame in an adaptive fashion. By utilizing this property, we propose a scheme to obtain the solution in the adaptive fashion, which offers comparable performance with a reduced complexity compared to the previously proposed method and other existing suboptimal methods. Based on a derived expression composed of the channel gains, the numbers of assigned subcarriers, and the data rates along with the new proposed processing procedures, the proposed adaptive scheme is able to track the channel variation for the solution adjustment in a faster speed compared to the original batch mode method. Simulation results reveal that the proposed adaptive scheme has the competitive performance compared with those of the optimal and the existing schemes while the computational complexity and the number of iterations are both reduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6750007/06702840.pdf","startPage":"669","endPage":"679","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TW.2013.123013.121981","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TW.2013.123013.121981","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Allocation Scheme in Multiuser OFDM Systems with Time-Varying Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","OFDM","Computational complexity","Bit error rate","Wireless communication","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","optimal systems","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive allocation scheme","multiuser OFDM systems","time-varying channels","power allocation problem","multiuser systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","downlink transmission","batch mode","computational complexity","adaptive fashion","suboptimal methods","channel gains","channel variation","solution adjustment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)","subcarrier allocation","power allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Allocation Scheme in Multiuser OFDM Systems with Time-Varying Channels","volume":"13","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6702840/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14131435","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Allocation Scheme in Multiuser OFDM Systems with Time-Varying Channels","sourcePdf":"0669-tw1402-pao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075379S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6750007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6750007","articleId":"6702840","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6702845,"authors":[{"name":"Joohyun Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6776574/6702845/6702845-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Joohyun Lee (S'll) received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 2008.

A cost-effective and practical solution is to offload cellular data through WiFi. Recent theoretical and experimental studies show that a scheme, referred to as delayed WiFi offloading, can significantly save the cellular capacity by delaying users' data and exploiting mobility and thus increasing chance of meeting WiFi APs (Access Points). Despite a huge potential of WiFi offloading in alleviating mobile data explosion, its success largely depends on the economic incentives provided to users and operators to deploy and use delayed offloading. In this paper, we study how much economic benefits can be generated due to delayed WiFi offloading, by modeling the interaction between a single provider and users based on a two-stage sequential game. We first analytically prove that WiFi offloading is economically beneficial for both the provider and users. Also, we conduct trace-driven numerical analysis to quantify the practical gain, where the increase ranges from 21% to 152% in the providers revenue, and from 73% to 319% in the users surplus.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.010214.130949","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6776574/06702845.pdf","startPage":"1540","endPage":"1554","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.010214.130949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Economics of WiFi Offloading: Trading Delay for Cellular Capacity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"Economics of WiFi Offloading: Trading Delay for Cellular Capacity","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6702845/","accessionNumber":"14181465","volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Economics of WiFi Offloading: Trading Delay for Cellular Capacity","sourcePdf":"1540-tw1403-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104899S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6776574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6776574","articleId":"6702845","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6702849,"authors":[{"name":"Duy H.

We examine and compare the multicell system under two operating modes: competition and coordination. In the competition mode, the paper considers a strategic non-cooperative game (SNG), where each base-station (BS) greedily determines its BD precoding strategy in a distributed manner, based on the knowledge of the inter-cell interference at its connected mobile-stations (MS). Via the game-theory framework, the existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium in this SNG are subsequently studied. In the coordination mode, the BD precoders are jointly designed across the multiple BSs to maximize the network weighted sum-rate (WSR). Since this WSR maximization problem is nonconvex, we consider a distributed algorithm to obtain at least a locally optimal solution. Finally, we extend our analysis of the multicell BD precoding to the case of BD-Dirty Paper Coding (BD-DPC) precoding. We characterize BD-DPC precoding game for the multicell system in the competition mode and propose an algorithm to jointly optimize BD-DPC precoders for the multicell system in the coordination mode. Simulation results show significant network sum-rate improvements by jointly designing the BD or BD-DPC precoders across the multicell system in the coordination mode over the competition mode.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6750007/06702849.pdf","startPage":"968","endPage":"981","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.010214.130724","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.010214.130724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750007","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block-Diagonalization Precoding in a Multiuser Multicell MIMO System: Competition and Coordination","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Interference","MIMO","Optimization","Vectors","Downlink","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","MIMO communication","multiuser channels","optimisation","precoding","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser multicell MIMO system","block-diagonalization precoding","per-cell basis","competition mode","strategic noncooperative game","SNG","base station","BD precoding strategy","intercell interference","mobile stations","game-theory framework","Nash equilibrium","network weighted sum-rate","WSR maximization problem","distributed algorithm","multicell BD precoding","BD-dirty paper coding","BD-DPC precoding game","coordination mode","network sum-rate improvements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicell transmissions","multiuser","block-diagonalization precoding","non-cooperative game","Nash equilibrium","optimization","CoMP","interference coordination"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Block-Diagonalization Precoding in a Multiuser Multicell MIMO System: Competition and Coordination","volume":"13","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6702849/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14131444","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block-Diagonalization Precoding in a Multiuser Multicell MIMO System: Competition and Coordination","sourcePdf":"0968-tw1402-duy.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093753S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6750007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6750007","articleId":"6702849","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6702850,"authors":[{"name":"Nader Mokari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6750007/6702850/6702850-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nader Mokari is a Ph.D. student at Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.

To do so, the SU transmission is divided into two hops: at first hop, the SU transmitter sends the information to a relay set and the SU receiver acts as a friendly jammer to disturb the overhearing of eavesdroppers and at the second hop, one of the relays is selected to pass the information to the SU receiver and the SU transmitter acts as a friendly jammer for the PU. In this new setup, the time duration for each hop, the power transmissions of all nodes in CRN, and relay selection at the second hop are allocated in such a way that the secrecy rate of the SU is maximized subject to the minimum required PU's secrecy rate. From primary service perspective, this transforms the possibly disturbing secondary service activities into a beneficial network element. We investigate instantaneous and ergodic resource allocation problems for perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI). Since these problems are non-convex, we propose a solution based on decomposition of main optimization problem into three subproblems related to the power allocation, time allocation, and relay selection. We show that the power allocation problem can be transformed into a generalized geometric programming (GGP) model via the so-called scaled algorithm and it can be solved very efficiently. Simulation results indicate that in terms of the secondary secrecy rate, the proposed setup outperforms the conventional setup in which the secrecy rate of the PU is not guaranteed.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.010214.130929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750007","startPage":"1058","endPage":"1073","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6750007/06702850.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative Secure Resource Allocation in Cognitive Radio Networks with Guaranteed Secrecy Rate for Primary Users","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6702850/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cooperative Secure Resource Allocation in Cognitive Radio Networks with Guaranteed Secrecy Rate for Primary Users","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14131459","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative Secure Resource Allocation in Cognitive Radio Networks with Guaranteed Secrecy Rate for Primary Users","sourcePdf":"1058-tw1402-nader.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08843S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6750007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6750007","articleId":"6702850","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6702851,"authors":[{"name":"Evan Everett","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6750007/6702851/6702851-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Evan Everett (S'06) received the B.Eng degree in Wireless Engineering and the B.S degree in Physics from Auburn University in 2010.

Although the focus of the previous works has been active cancellation of the self-interference signal, a majority of the overall self-interference suppression is often due to passive suppression, i.e., isolation of the transmit and receive antennas. We present a measurement-based study of the capabilities and limitations of three key mechanisms for passive self-interference suppression: directional isolation, absorptive shielding, and cross-polarization. The study demonstrates that more than 70 dB of passive suppression can be achieved in certain environments, but also establishes two results on the limitations of passive suppression: (1) environmental reflections limit the amount of passive suppression that can be achieved, and (2) passive suppression, in general, increases the frequency selectivity of the residual self-interference signal. These results suggest two design implications: (1) deployments of full-duplex infrastructure nodes should minimize near-antenna reflectors, and (2) active cancellation in concatenation with passive suppression should employ higher-order filters or per-subcarrier cancellation.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2013.010214.130226","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6750007/06702851.pdf","startPage":"680","endPage":"694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6750007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2013.010214.130226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive Self-Interference Suppression for Full-Duplex Infrastructure Nodes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6702851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","displayDocTitle":"Passive Self-Interference Suppression for Full-Duplex Infrastructure Nodes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702851/","publicationDate":"February 2014","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14131464","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6702851/","volume":"13","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive Self-Interference Suppression for Full-Duplex Infrastructure Nodes","sourcePdf":"0680-tw1402-everett.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089141S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6750007","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"501","xplore-issue":"6750007","articleId":"6702851","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6702854,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiguo Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6750007/6702854/6702854-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhiguo Ding (S'03-M'05) received his B.Eng in Electrical Engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2000, and the Ph.D degree in Electrical Engineering from Imperial College London in 2005.

The focus of this paper is on the relay's strategies to distribute the harvested energy among the multiple users and their impact on the system performance. Specifically, a non-cooperative strategy that uses the energy harvested from the i-th source as the relay transmission power to the i-th destination is considered first, and asymptotic results show that its outage performance decays as log SNR/SNR. A faster decay rate, 1/SNR, can be achieved by two centralized strategies proposed next, of which a water filling based one can achieve optimal performance with respect to several criteria, at the price of high complexity. An auction based power allocation scheme is also proposed to achieve a better tradeoff between system performance and complexity.

Specifically, by applying the theory of effective capacity and taking PN's activity statistics into consideration, we first analyze the maximum achievable throughput of the CRN under two dominant transmission modes, namely underlay and overlay, respectively, and provide efficient algorithms to derive optimal transmission strategies for the two modes. Following the analyses, we then propose a hybrid underlay/overlay transmission mode, through which the cognitive users' QoS requirements can be better guaranteed and network throughput can be further improved. Moreover, we analyze the optimal transmission strategies for both underlay and overlay modes under two limiting cases. Analyses indicate that 1) for the loose QoS requirement, optimal transmission strategies for both underlay and overlay modes become the water-filling algorithm; and 2) for the stringent QoS requirement, the cognitive user will transmit with constant rate. Furthermore, the impact of imperfect channel estimations on our proposed transmission mode is discussed. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the impacts of delay QoS requirements and PN's activity statistics on maximizing the delay-constrained throughput for both underlay and overlay modes and verify the effectiveness of our proposed transmission mode. Moreover, for the overlay mode, we observe that 1) a unique optimal sensing time exists under the given QoS constraint; and 2) the optimal sensing time surprisingly increases as the QoS constraint gets more stringent.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6702855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14181487","htmlLink":"/document/6702855/","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Underlay/Overlay Transmission Mode for Cognitive Radio Networks with Statistical Quality-of-Service Provisioning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Underlay/Overlay Transmission Mode for Cognitive Radio Networks with Statistical Quality-of-Service Provisioning","sourcePdf":"1482-tw1403-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098785S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6776574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6776574","articleId":"6702855","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6702934,"authors":[{"name":"Long Li","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Li","id":"37086747603"},{"name":"Buyang Cao","affiliation":["School of Software Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Buyang","lastName":"Cao","id":"37086747917"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Liu","affiliation":["Site Reliability Engineering, EBay Engineering and Research Center (Shanghai), Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086745864"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0245-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3985-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-1456"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-1472"}],"articleNumber":"6702934","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Cloud computing","Detection algorithms","Engines","Filtering algorithms","Educational institutions","Companies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","cost reduction","resource allocation","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CEP-based system status monitoring","cloud computing systems","private cloud platforms","resource utilization","cost reduction","system monitoring","data center","complex event processing","system status detection algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","private cloud","complex event processing","unhealthy status","system status monitoring"]}],"abstract":"Cloud Computing Technology has been evolving rapidly in recent years and is applied widely due to its unique advantages.

If someone has robust forecasting tools, then he/she will increase the return on investment and can get rich easily and quickly. Because there are a lot of factors that can influence the stock market, the stock forecasting problem has always been very complicated. Support Vector Regression is a tool from machine learning that can build a regression model on the historical time series data in the purpose of predicting the future trend of the stock price. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical framework to apply the Support Vector Regression (SVR) strategy to predict the stock market.

The new method reconstructs the spatial spectrum function with both noise subspace and signal subspace in this paper. The key idea is to apply the full information contained in covariance matrix and change the projection weights of steering vector on the noise and signal subspace by their revised eigenvalues, respectively. Comparing with the MUSIC algorithm, it does not increase any computational complexity either, and remarkably, it has the advantages of simultaneously reducing noise and keeping the high-resolution ability under low SNR and small sample sized scenarios.

Reliable spectrum sensing is one of foundational techniques for cognitive users to detect spectrum holes and monitor licensed users' activities in cognitive radio. However, many factors make it much difficult for single cognitive user to accurately and rapidly identify the activity status of licensed users, such as very low signal-to-noise ratio, and noise uncertainty, and fading, and shadowing, and quite short sensing time, etc. In this paper, we proposed a weighted scheme for cooperative spectrum sensing considering trust factor of each collaborative user to improve the global sensing performance in cognitive radio networks. The cognitive users performed spectrum sensing using energy detectors and transmitted their binary local decisions as well as binary information on the success or failure in previous data transmission to the fusion center for a global decision based weighted decision fusion on the absence or presence of the licensed users' activities. Weighted values depended on trust factors of corresponding cognitive users.

In addition, performance analysis on different signal to noise ratio (SNR) environment is discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6703285/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14027709","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6703285/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An improved weighted cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved weighted cooperative spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Xianning, China","sourcePdf":"1030CNT1445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054549S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693052","isNumber":"6703249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693052","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6703249","articleId":"6703285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6703288,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks of Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085872071"},{"name":"Fang Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks of Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086763511"},{"name":"Lihui Yu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks of Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Lihui","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085554927"},{"name":"Tong Hu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks of Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tong","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085550972"},{"name":"Yingchun Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks of Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yingchun","lastName":"Li","id":"37538194400"},{"name":"Yingxiong Song","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Specialty Fiber Optics and Optical Access Networks of Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yingxiong","lastName":"Song","id":"37281076500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2860-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2859-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2858-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6703288","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Synchronization","Training","Optical receivers","Adaptive optics","Optical fibers","Passive optical networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","optical receivers","passive optical networks","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM-PON symbol synchronization technology","absolute value error","training sequence","real time symbol synchronization","frame synchronization","standard single-mode fiber","bit error rate","distance 25 km","bit rate 2.5 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM-PON","synchronization algorithm","training sequence"]}],"abstract":"A simple, low cost and robust OFDM-PON symbol synchronization technology is proposed and experimentally demonstrated.

Specifically, we consider a CRN where unlicensed networks employ network coding for data storage control in a secondary base station. We put up three different data-change scenarios and five kinds of comparison mechanisms in every scenario based on heterogeneous traffic. For performance measures, we derive the blocking probability, the probability of forced termination, throughput and spectrum utilization. Numerical results show that compared to the existing approaches, the proposed scheme can carry out higher stable traffic load and spectrum utilization of unlicensed users.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CECNet.2013.6703291","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6703249","startPage":"137","endPage":"140","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 3rd International Conference on Consumer Electronics, Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693052/6703249/06703291.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of cognitive radio spectrum access with heterogeneous traffic under buffer constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6703291/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6703291/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of cognitive radio spectrum access with heterogeneous traffic under buffer constraints","conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027740","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of cognitive radio spectrum access with heterogeneous traffic under buffer constraints","confLoc":"Xianning, China","sourcePdf":"1036CNT1278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049915S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693052","isNumber":"6703249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693052","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6703249","articleId":"6703291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6703307,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenxin Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Zhenxin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086729545"},{"name":"Dongxin Wei","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Dongxin","lastName":"Wei","id":"37086724723"},{"name":"Zhe Chen","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086728478"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2860-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2859-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2858-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6703307","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Signal to noise ratio","IEEE 802.11 Standards","TV","Throughput","Error probability","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","signal detection","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative spectrum sensing","imperfect reporting channel","cognitive radio","WiFi networks","wireless Internet access","bit error probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","imperfect reporting channel","Wi-Fi networks","K out of N rule"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative spectrum sensing over imperfect reporting channels in cognitive radio for Wi-Fi networks","doi":"10.1109/CECNet.2013.6703307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6703249","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"2013 3rd International Conference on Consumer Electronics, Communications and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 3rd International Conference on Consumer Electronics, Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693052/6703249/06703307.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CECNet.2013.6703307","startPage":"203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6703307","abstract":"Cognitive radio is a promising technology to improve the utilization of wireless spectrum resources.

So, in this paper, we consider in our system model two types of services, real-time and non real-time. We divide the secondary users into two priorities and propose a spectrum handoff mechanism and a resource reservation policy, implementing different strategies for different services to strictly guarantee the QoS of secondary users with hybrid services while maximizing the throughput of cognitive radio networks. The cognitive radio system is depicted with the aid of a multi-dimensions Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model, where we derive the main performance metrics for secondary users including the session blocking probability, dropping probability, throughput and mean handoff delay. Numerical results confirm the validity of the proposed model and schemes for hybrid services in cognitive radio networks.","doi":"10.1109/CECNet.2013.6703368","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 3rd International Conference on Consumer Electronics, Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693052/6703249/06703368.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6703249","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CECNet.2013.6703368","publicationTitle":"2013 3rd International Conference on Consumer Electronics, Communications and Networks","startPage":"457","endPage":"460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality of hybrid services in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6703368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Quality of hybrid services in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6703368/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6703368/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027633","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality of hybrid services in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Xianning, China","sourcePdf":"1113CNT1271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043171S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693052","isNumber":"6703249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693052","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6703249","articleId":"6703368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6703370,"authors":[{"name":"Jianwen Gao","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Hainan University, Haikou, Hainan, China"],"firstName":"Jianwen","lastName":"Gao","id":"37086741880"},{"name":"Yong Bai","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Hainan University, Haikou, Hainan, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Bai","id":"37534459200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2860-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2859-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2858-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6703370","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate quasi-orthogonal STBC (QOSTBC) with Givens rotation for the OFDM system over frequency selective fading channels.

The proposed method could enhance the performance of targets detection and range-Doppler parameters estimation in low SINR without known the sparsity of the original signal with the idea of choosing supplements of the sparse signal adaptively and optimizing transmit waveform.

The appearance of device-to-device (D2D) communication provides one way for solving this problem. In this paper, we developed the way to construct virtual antenna array by D2D links and find the method to get diversity gains using space time block coding between inter cluster communication. We focused on researching Alamouti coding which is used in virtual MIMO communication in two different ways, one is decoding and the other is amplifying. Signal combination in receiver cluster is also analyzed for increasing the possibility of decoding.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 3rd International Conference on Consumer Electronics, Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693052/6703249/06703432.pdf","startPage":"718","endPage":"722","publicationTitle":"2013 3rd International Conference on Consumer Electronics, Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/CECNet.2013.6703432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CECNet.2013.6703432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6703249","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6703432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual MIMO communication based on D2D link","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Decoding","Interference","Antenna arrays","Arrays","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","diversity reception","MIMO communication","mobile communication","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual MIMO communication","D2D link","MIMO technology","handheld equipment","device-to-device communication","D2D communication","virtual antenna array","diversity gains","space time block coding","intercluster communication","Alamouti coding","decoding","signal combination","receiver cluster"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["D2D","cooperative communication","virtual MIMO","Alamouti coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6703432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Virtual MIMO communication based on D2D link","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6703432/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027772","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual MIMO communication based on D2D link","confLoc":"Xianning, China","sourcePdf":"1177CNT1472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065119S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693052","isNumber":"6703249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693052","xplore-issue":"6703249","articleId":"6703432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6703435,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086726058"},{"name":"Le-nan Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Le-nan","lastName":"Wu","id":"37277032100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2860-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2859-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2858-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6703435","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":225},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Iterative decoding","Mathematical model","Equations","Approximation algorithms","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error statistics","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted candidate bit based bit-flipping decoding algorithms","low-density parity-check codes","LDPC codes","weighted hard-decision","parity check equations","min-sum decoding algorithm","frame error rate","FER performance","candidate bit based bit-flipping algorithm","CBBF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bit flipping (BF)","low-density parity-check (LDPC)","min-sum decoding","hard-decision"]}],"abstract":"In order to improve the bit-flipping (BF) decoding algorithms, a weighted hard-decision based BF decoding algorithm for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is presented, in which the weights of variable-nodes are employed.

The contribution of shape-related features was assessed by developing a Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system whose classification is solely based on this type of features. Four shape descriptors were used, first separately and then simultaneously, to describe the images. Image segmentation was performed both manually, by an expert, and automatically, by using an Adaptive Thresholding algorithm. The best performances were SE = 92% and SP = 74%, obtained for manually segmented images, and SE = 92% and SP = 78%, obtained for automatically segmented images. These results were achieved by combining the shape descriptors and show that shape information plays an important role in melanoma detection. Furthermore, no degradation was observed when automatic segmentation methods are used, instead of manual ones.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 8th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693156/6703696/06703751.pdf","startPage":"268","endPage":"273","publicationTitle":"2013 8th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2013.6703751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2013.6703751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6703696","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6703751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the role of shape in the detection of melanomas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lesions","Shape","Malignant tumors","Image segmentation","Feature extraction","Manuals","Image color analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","cancer","cellular biophysics","feature extraction","image classification","image segmentation","medical image processing","object detection","optical microscopy","shape recognition","skin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shape role","melanoma detection","dermoscopy images","shape-related features","computer-aided diagnosis system","CAD","shape descriptors","image segmentation","adaptive thresholding algorithm","cancer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6703751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"On the role of shape in the detection of melanomas","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6703751/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027987","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the role of shape in the detection of melanomas","confLoc":"Trieste, Italy","sourcePdf":"00560159.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098809S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693156","isNumber":"6703696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693156","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6703696","articleId":"6703751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Trieste and University of Zagreb","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6703761,"authors":[{"name":"Alen Pelinkovi\u0107","affiliation":["IT Department, Investment and Development Fund of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Alen","lastName":"Pelinkovi\u0107","id":"37086727004"},{"name":"Slobodan Djukanovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Slobodan","lastName":"Djukanovi\u0107","id":"37599030200"},{"name":"Igor Djurovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Djurovi\u0107","id":"37268233700"},{"name":"Marko Simeunovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Simeunovi\u0107","id":"37085340903"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-184-194-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1845-5921"}],"articleNumber":"6703761","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Estimation","Frequency estimation","Synchronization","Signal processing algorithms","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adjacent channel interference","AWGN channels","data communication","fading channels","frequency-domain analysis","interference suppression","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency domain method","carrier frequency offset estimation","OFDM system","wireless data transmission","multicarrier technique","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","high spectral efficiency","multipath fading suppression","wireless communication","mobility","transmitter","receiver","interchannel interference suppression","CFO estimation","iterative algorithm","AWGN channel","multipath channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Carrier frequency offset","AWGN","ICI","multipath"]}],"abstract":"The rapid growth and development of wireless data transmission brings new trends, challenges and constraints in the telecommunications field. Novel multicarrier techniques are proposed to meet these requirements. The orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is an attractive technique that achieves high data rate and high spectral efficiency and, at the same time, suppresses multipath fading in wireless communications. However, the OFDM is very sensitive to mobility of the transmitter, receiver or surrounding objects. The mobility produces interchannel interference which significantly deteriorates transmission performance. The interchannel interference suppression represent research challenge. Carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation and its compensation represent a way to improve OFDM system's performance. In this paper, we consider CFO estimation in the frequency domain by using well known iterative algorithms for precise estimation of spectral peak's central peak frequency. Simulations show that the proposed method outperforms standard CFO estimation methods in terms of accuracy. In simulations, both AWGN channel and multipath channel are considered.","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2013.6703761","publicationTitle":"2013 8th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 8th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693156/6703696/06703761.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"330","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2013.6703761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6703696","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A frequency domain method for the carrier frequency offset estimation in OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6703761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6703761/","displayDocTitle":"A frequency domain method for the carrier frequency offset estimation in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027959","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6703761/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A frequency domain method for the carrier frequency offset estimation in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Trieste, Italy","sourcePdf":"00660047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06665S","chronDate":"4-6 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693156","isNumber":"6703696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693156","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6703696","articleId":"6703761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"University of Trieste and University of Zagreb","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6703776,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Virgulti","affiliation":["Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Marche, IT"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Virgulti","id":"37085559718"},{"name":"Stefania Cecchi","affiliation":["A3lab - DII-Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefania","lastName":"Cecchi","id":"37602873100"},{"name":"Francesco Piazza","affiliation":["A3lab - DII-Universit\u00e0 Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Piazza","id":"37269338600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-184-194-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1845-5921"}],"articleNumber":"6703776","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6703776","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equalizers","Finite impulse response filters","Prototypes","Computational complexity","Signal processing algorithms","Frequency response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio signal processing","channel bank filters","FIR filters","frequency response","IIR filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IIR filter approximation","digital audio equalization","auditory frequency response","optimal filter","transition bandwidth development","FIR implementation","multirate system","filterbank theory","digital audio equalizer"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2013.6703776","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693156/6703696/06703776.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 8th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 8th International Symposium on Image and Signal Processing and Analysis (ISPA)","startPage":"410","endPage":"415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6703696","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2013.6703776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IIR filter approximation of an innovative digital audio equalizer","abstract":"Digital audio equalization is used to enhance the listening experience introducing corrections in the auditory frequency response.

The proposed architecture relies on the properties of the adaptive combination of filters which exploits the capabilities of different constituents, thus adaptively providing at least the behaviour of the best performing filter. Applying this concept to multichannel filtering systems, we define a scheme for the combination of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) filters. More precisely the proposed structure involves the combination of two different multiple-input singleoutput (MISO) systems for each MIMO output. We propose such framework with application to the multichannel acoustic echo cancellation (MAEC) with the goal of giving robustness to the system against impulsive background noise, and thus improving overall cancelling performance.

The zero error initial condition in most of the previous work on terminal iterative learning control (TILC) is removed by the use of neural network. A radial basis function (RBF) neural network is developed to approximate the effect of initial state and reference on terminal output iteratively. By involving these information as well as the reference signal in the control scheme, the proposed NNTILC can drive the system to track run-varying reference point fast and precisely beyond the initial state variance and reference change. Stability and convergence of this approach are proved and computer simulation results are provided to confirm its effectiveness further.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAS.2013.6703896","startPage":"213","endPage":"218","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6685219/6703852/06703896.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS 2013)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAS.2013.6703896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6703852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based terminal iterative learning control for tracking run-varying reference point with initial state variance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","discrete time systems","iterative methods","learning systems","linear systems","neurocontrollers","radial basis function networks","stability","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["run-varying reference point tracking","initial state variance","neural network based terminal iterative learning control","discrete time uncertain linear systems","zero error initial condition","radial basis function","RBF neural network","initial state effect","reference effect","terminal output","NNTILC","stability","convergence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Terminal iterative learning control","Neural network","Run-varying reference","Initial state variance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6703896/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based terminal iterative learning control for tracking run-varying reference point with initial state variance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6703896/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14025400","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based terminal iterative learning control for tracking run-varying reference point with initial state variance","confLoc":"Gwangju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MB012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088947S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6685219","isNumber":"6703852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6685219","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6703852","articleId":"6703896","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6703898,"authors":[{"name":"Chiang-Ju Chien","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Huafan University, New Taipei City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chiang-Ju","lastName":"Chien","id":"37275379400"},{"name":"Ying-Chung Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Huafan University, New Taipei City, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ying-Chung","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293644000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-93215-05-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2093-7121"}],"articleNumber":"6703898","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6703898","abstract":"To deal with the iterative learning control problem for more general class of uncertain nonlinear systems using only output measurement, an observer based adaptive iterative learning control strategy using filtered fuzzy neural network was proposed in this paper. A model reference control technique is firstly presented to derive a state error observer for state estimation. A mixed time-domain and s -domain representation is then used to develop an error model as a relative degree one stable system with some uncertain nonlinearities and filtered signals as the inputs. An averaging filter is also proposed to further transform the error model so that the AILC can be implemented without using differentiators. The main learning component of the controller is constructed by an filtered fuzzy neural network with the estimated state variables as network input. This main component performs as an approximator to compensate for the unknown system nonlinearities. Furthermore, a normalization signal is applied as a bounding function for designing a robust learning component in order to overcome the lumped uncertainties from function approximation error and state estimation error. Finally, a stabilization learning component is used to guarantee the boundedness of internal signals. Adaptive algorithms are derived to search for suitable parameters during each iteration since the optimal parameters for a good function approximation are in general unavailable. Based on a Lyapunov like analysis, we show that the output tracking error can converge, with all the internal signals bounded, to a small residual set whose level of magnitude depends on a design parameter. Simulation results also show the nice tracking performance with application to some practical nonlinear systems.","doi":"10.1109/ICCAS.2013.6703898","startPage":"226","endPage":"232","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6685219/6703852/06703898.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS 2013)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAS.2013.6703898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6703852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An observer-based fuzzy neural network adaptive ILC for nonlinear systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Approximation methods","Artificial neural networks","Vectors","Cities and towns","Time-domain analysis","Learning systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","fuzzy neural nets","iterative methods","learning systems","Lyapunov methods","model reference adaptive control systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","observers","stability","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["observer-based fuzzy neural network adaptive ILC","uncertain nonlinear systems","adaptive iterative learning control strategy","filtered fuzzy neural network","model reference control","state error observer","time-domain representation","s-domain representation","relative degree one stable system","uncertain nonlinearities","averaging filter","AILC","system nonlinearities","normalization signal","bounding function","robust learning component","lumped uncertainties","function approximation error","state estimation error","stabilization learning component","Lyapunov like analysis","output tracking error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6703898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"An observer-based fuzzy neural network adaptive ILC for nonlinear systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6703898/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14025360","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An observer-based fuzzy neural network adaptive ILC for nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Gwangju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MB014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063385S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6685219","isNumber":"6703852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6685219","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6703852","articleId":"6703898","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6703938,"authors":[{"name":"Jae Pil Ko","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Pil","lastName":"Ko","id":"37085360958"},{"name":"Jung Won Jung","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Co., Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jung Won","lastName":"Jung","id":"37086711503"},{"name":"Jae Wook Jeon","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jae Wook","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37295879900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-93215-05-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2093-7121"}],"articleNumber":"6703938","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":654},"abstract":"This work presents an anti-collision method for an automated guided vehicle (AGV).

First, an AGV easily obtains its position and direction data from the inexpensive, reliable, and flexible radio frequency (RF) tag. Second, the control tower, the Coordinator, determines the AGV's priority and route by combining various data acquired through other AGVs on the basis of a first-in-first-out algorithm and the shared memory architecture. Third, the AGVs transmit their status data to the Coordinator, and receive the driving data from the Coordinator on the ZigBee network which is a specification for wireless communication protocols using small, inexpensive, low-power digital radios.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6685219/6703852/06703938.pdf","startPage":"599","endPage":"604","publicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS 2013)","doi":"10.1109/ICCAS.2013.6703938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAS.2013.6703938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6703852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6703938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anti-collision method for AGV using RFID and ZigBee network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Reliability","Indexes","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic guided vehicles","radiofrequency identification","shared memory systems","Zigbee"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anti-collision method","automated guided vehicle","AGV","ZigBee network","flexible radio frequency tag","RFID","first-in-first-out algorithm","shared memory architecture","wireless communication protocols","low-power digital radio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["automated guided vehicle (AGV)","radio frequency identification (RFID)","ZigBee"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6703938/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Anti-collision method for AGV using RFID and ZigBee network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6703938/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14025494","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anti-collision method for AGV using RFID and ZigBee network","confLoc":"Gwangju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"MC024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039709S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6685219","isNumber":"6703852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6685219","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6703852","articleId":"6703938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6703971,"authors":[{"name":"Ouboti Djaneye-Boundjou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Dayton, Dayton, Ohio, USA"],"firstName":"Ouboti","lastName":"Djaneye-Boundjou","id":"37085683385"},{"name":"Ra\u00fal Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Dayton, Dayton, Ohio, USA"],"firstName":"Ra\u00fal","lastName":"Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez","id":"37301363800"},{"name":"Veysel Gazi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Istanbul Kemerburgaz University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Veysel","lastName":"Gazi","id":"37326218500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-93215-05-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2093-7121"}],"articleNumber":"6703971","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":84},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","discrete time systems","Lyapunov methods","particle swarm optimisation","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stable adaptive particle swarm optimization","discrete-time adaptive control tools","Lyapunov direct method","ultimately uniformly bounded error system","Lasalle-Yoshizawa theorem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","Adaptive Control","Stability Analysis","Lyapunov's Direct Method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6703971","abstract":"Using discrete-time adaptive control tools found in literature, we develop an adaptive particle swarm optimizer.

Common task assignment algorithms obtain straight line paths during the task assignment phase and then plan the paths considering the threats, which can decrease performance of task assignment and task success rate. Therefore, task assignment with real-time path planning is presented in this paper using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming(MILP) and potential field method. Real-time path planning usually requires amount of computational time but MILP simplifies the task assignment problem so real-time path planning can be applied to task assignment. Task selection algorithm is also presented to compensate the modified sub-optimal MILP. MILP task selection algorithm is compared with a brute-force search algorithm which obtains optimal solutions in situations without threats. Simulation results are presented to show the advantages of MILP task selection algorithm in avoiding threats and performing tasks successfully.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous task assignment and path planning using mixed-integer linear programming and potential field method","publicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS 2013)","doi":"10.1109/ICCAS.2013.6704241","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6685219/6703852/06704241.pdf","startPage":"1845","endPage":"1848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCAS.2013.6704241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6703852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704241/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous task assignment and path planning using mixed-integer linear programming and potential field method","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704241/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14025208","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous task assignment and path planning using mixed-integer linear programming and potential field method","confLoc":"Gwangju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"WB072.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05123S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6685219","isNumber":"6703852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6685219","xplore-issue":"6703852","articleId":"6704241","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6704242,"authors":[{"name":"Byoungil Jeon","affiliation":["The Robotics Program, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Byoungil","lastName":"Jeon","id":"37086786477"},{"name":"Kwangyul Baek","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Kwangyul","lastName":"Baek","id":"37592292700"},{"name":"Chanho Kim","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Chanho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085538247"},{"name":"Hyochoong Bang","affiliation":["Department of Aerospace Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyochoong","lastName":"Bang","id":"37282302200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-93215-05-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2093-7121"}],"articleNumber":"6704242","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":242},"abstract":"This paper addresses mode changing tracker that has global and local tracking mode for efficient target tracking in aerial images from unmanned aerial vehicle.

The covariance matrix is one of the efficient ways describing models as fusion of spatial and statistical properties of features. In local tracking, tracker conducts object tracking with kernel-based object tracking algorithm.

We compare the performance of this algorithm in terms of system throughput and video quality with the two popular precoding techniques, namely, block diagonalization (BD) and successive optimization (SO). We also compare its performance with the generalized versions of these two algorithms termed coordinated transmit-receive processing (CTR)-BD and CTR-SO algorithms, respectively. Further, we propose an extension of the MS-MRT scheme to broadcast scenarios, termed broadcast successive maximum ratio transmission (BS-MRT), which computes the optimal broadcast beamforming vector to maximize the video quality at each of the broadcast group members while maintaining orthogonality to the previously scheduled user groups. We also demonstrate that the proposed MS-MRT and BS-MRT schemes can be naturally adapted to the context of various MU OFDMA scheduling algorithms such as proportional fairness (PF) and round robin (RR), to name a few, to maximize video quality through optimal scheduling in the presence of a large number of users. We discuss implementations of the proposed MS-MRT scheme in association with these scheduling algorithms for MU unicast and broadcast video transmission scenarios. The simulation results presented in this work rely on the rate models derived using the Joint Scalable Video Model (JSVM) software developed by the Joint Video Team (JVT) and are, thus, readily applicable in practice. The presented results clearly demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm to maximize the video quality in comparison with the other competing MU MIMO precoding techniques.

The proposed scheme combines a simplified parallel interference cancelation (S-PIC) with the block decision feedback equalization (BDFE) algorithm. To account for the extra (N - M)-dimension in the transmitted signal, the UD-MIMO system is partitioned into two subsystems: one with (N - M) transmit antennas and the other one with M transmit antennas. The interference from the first subsystem to the second one is canceled in parallel, and BDFE is performed over the second subsystem. Unlike conventional PIC methods that exhaustively search all the Q(N-M) sequences in the first subsystem, with Q being the constellation size, the proposed scheme explores only a small number of candidate sequences in the first subsystem; thus, it achieves significant complexity reduction. Two new candidate sequence selection methods are proposed. In the first iteration, the candidate sequences used for PIC are selected by exploring the statistical properties of the received signals. In the second iteration and beyond, the set containing the candidate sequences is constructed by utilizing the soft information generated from the previous iteration. The proposed scheme provides a balanced tradeoff between computational complexity and bit error rate (BER) performance.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2298232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6895341/06704288.pdf","startPage":"3196","endPage":"3208","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2298232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6895341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simplified Parallel Interference Cancelation for Underdetermined MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704288/","displayDocTitle":"Simplified Parallel Interference Cancelation for Underdetermined MIMO Systems","volume":"63","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14581685","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704288/","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB32920"},{"fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271266"},{"fundingName":"National High-Tech Research and Development Program (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2012AA011704"},{"fundingName":"ZTE Fund","grantNumber":"CON1307250001"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-0846486"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1202075"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simplified Parallel Interference Cancelation for Underdetermined MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-qian-2298232-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129311S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6895341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6895341","articleId":"6704288","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6704289,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Tang","affiliation":["Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Potsdam, Germany","Institute of Physics, Humboldt University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/6914636/6704289/tang-2295966-small.gif","p":["Yang Tang (M'11) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Donghua University, Shanghai, China, in 2006 and 2010, respectively.","He was a Research Associate with The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong, from 2008 to 2010.

Two kinds of pinning schemes are considered: 1) pinned nodes are fixed along the time evolution and 2) pinned nodes are switched from time to time according to a set of Bernoulli stochastic variables. Using Lyapunov function methods and stochastic analysis techniques, several easily verifiable criteria are derived for the problem of pinning distributed synchronization. For the case of fixed pinned nodes, a novel mixed optimization method is developed to select the pinned nodes and find feasible solutions, which is composed of a traditional convex optimization method and a constraint optimization evolutionary algorithm. For the case of switching pinning scheme, upper bounds of the convergence rate and the mean control gain are obtained theoretically. Simulation examples are provided to show the advantages of our proposed optimization method over previous ones and verify the effectiveness of the obtained results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704289/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6704289/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14633764","pubMedId":"25291734","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pinning Distributed Synchronization of Stochastic Dynamical Networks: A Mixed Optimization Approach","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61203235, 61333012, 61175119 and 61273201"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"NCET-10-0329"},{"fundingName":"IRTG","grantNumber":"1740"},{"fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pinning Distributed Synchronization of Stochastic Dynamical Networks: A Mixed Optimization Approach","sourcePdf":"tnnls-tang-2295966-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119518S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6914636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"6914636","articleId":"6704289","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6704290,"authors":[{"name":"Wenwen Yang","affiliation":["State Key Lab. of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenwen","lastName":"Yang","id":"38577873000"},{"name":"Jianyi Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Lab. of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianyi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37291307800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6704290","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3270},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aperture antennas","Antenna measurements","Bandwidth","Broadband antennas","Cavity resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","aperture antennas","broadband antennas","microstrip antennas","microwave antennas","polarisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AR bandwidth","axial-ratio bandwidth","unidirectional radiation","bidirectional radiation","parasitic square patch","low-profile backed cavity","wideband circularly polarized cavity-backed aperture antenna","frequency 6 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aperture antenna","cavity-backed","circularly polarized","wideband"]}],"abstract":"A technique to design a wideband circularly polarized (CP) cavity-backed aperture antenna is presented in this letter.

Based on the experimental results and on a supporting simulation study, it was found that the MOSFET-based 1T-DRAM, when enabled by a biristor mode, is preferred for long-term endurance compared with MOSFET-based 1T-DRAM when operated in a conventional mode. Although a high drain voltage is required in the biristor mode for programming, improved endurance characteristics are observed.

By virtue of the proposed ELMs, parsimonious structure and excellent generalization of multiinput-multioutput single hidden-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) are obtained. The proposed ELMs are developed by innovative decomposition of the recursive orthogonal least squares procedure into sequential partial orthogonalization (SPO). The salient features of the proposed approaches are as follows: 1) Initial hidden nodes are randomly generated by the ELM methodology and recursively orthogonalized into an upper triangular matrix with dramatic reduction in matrix size; 2) the constructive SPO in the CP-ELM focuses on the partial matrix with the subcolumn of the selected regressor including nonzeros as the first column while the destructive SPO in the DP-ELM operates on the partial matrix including elements determined by the removed regressor; 3) termination criteria for CP- and DP-ELM are simplified by the additional residual error reduction method; and 4) the output weights of the SLFN need not be solved in the model selection procedure and is derived from the final upper triangular equation by backward substitution. Both single- and multi-output real-world regression data sets are used to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the CP- and DP-ELM in terms of parsimonious architecture and generalization accuracy. Innovative applications to nonlinear time-series modeling demonstrate superior identification results.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2296048","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6914636/06704311.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2296048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6914636","startPage":"1828","endPage":"1841","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parsimonious Extreme Learning Machine Using Recursive Orthogonal Least Squares","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parsimonious Extreme Learning Machine Using Recursive Orthogonal Least Squares","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704311/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14633766","pubMedId":"25291736","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6704311/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51009017, 51379002 and 61074096"},{"fundingName":"Applied Basic Research Funds from the Ministry of Transport of China","grantNumber":"2012-329-225-060"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2012M520629"},{"fundingName":"Program for Liaoning Excellent Talents in University","grantNumber":"JQ2013055"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"2009QN025, 2011JC002 and 3132013025"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parsimonious Extreme Learning Machine Using Recursive Orthogonal Least Squares","sourcePdf":"tnnls-wang-2296048-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116028S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6914636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"6914636","articleId":"6704311","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6704322,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Peter","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Wireless Communication Centre (WCC) Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Johor, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6782660/6704322/6704322-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thomas Peter (S'09\u2013M'13) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from University Teknologi Malaysia in 2001 and 2007, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering in the area of Antennas and Propagation from Brunel University, London, U.K., in 2012.

Since the approval by the Federal Communications Committee (FCC) in 2002, much research has been undertaken on UWB technology, especially for wireless communications. However, in the last decade, UWB has also been proposed as a power harvester. In this paper, a transparent cone-top-tapered slot antenna covering the frequency range from 2.2 to 12.1 GHz is designed and fabricated to provide UWB communications whilst integrated onto solar panels as well as harvest electromagnetic waves from free space and convert them into electrical energy. The antenna when sandwiched between an a-Si solar panel and glass is able to demonstrate a quasi omni-directional pattern that is characteristic of a UWB. The antenna when connected to a 2.55-GHz rectifier is able to produce 18-mV dc in free space and 4.4-mV dc on glass for an input power of 10 dBm at a distance of 5 cm. Although the antenna presented in this paper is a UWB antenna, only an operating range of 2.49 to 2.58 GHz for power scavenging is possible due to the limitation of the narrowband rectifier used for the study.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2298044","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6782660/06704322.pdf","startPage":"1844","endPage":"1853","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2298044","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782660","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Transparent UWB Antenna for Photovoltaic Solar Panel Integration and RF Energy Harvesting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Transparent UWB Antenna for Photovoltaic Solar Panel Integration and RF Energy Harvesting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704322/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","volume":"62","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704322/","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2014","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14210792","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Transparent UWB Antenna for Photovoltaic Solar Panel Integration and RF Energy Harvesting","sourcePdf":"tap-peter-2298044-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080712S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6782660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"6782660","articleId":"6704322","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6704324,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Vavoulas","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Biomedical Informatics, University of Thessaly, Lamia, Greece","Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Vavoulas","id":"37859855300"},{"name":"Harilaos G.

However, the significant attenuation degree due to high absorption and scattering of optical transmission in the water confines the achievable range of optical links to only few meters. One way to achieve transmission at long distances is to employ a dense network configuration where information can be transferred through a series of intermediate nodes acting as relays. In this study, we consider optical wireless network arrangements where nodes are floating at different depths into a service aquatic medium. We deploy an effective path loss model which incorporates the key factors that deteriorate the optical power, and we derive the achievable transmission range to satisfy connectivity criteria assuming intensity-modulation direct detection (IM/DD) with on-off keying (OOK). A set of numerical results is presented in order to reveal the interaction between various parameters such as error probability, wavelength, node density, transmitted power, data rate, etc., in order to achieve k-connectivity. The proposed analysis could be the basis of deploying reliable underwater optical networks suitable to deliver broadband services at far distances.","doi":"10.1109/JOE.2013.2291135","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/48/6913587/06704324.pdf","startPage":"801","endPage":"809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JOE.2013.2291135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6913587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Underwater Optical Wireless Networks: A --Connectivity Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704324/","displayDocTitle":"Underwater Optical Wireless Networks: A <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$k$</tex></formula>-Connectivity Analysis","volume":"39","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14663582","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704324/","dateOfInsertion":"09 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Underwater Optical Wireless Networks: A <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$k$</tex></formula>-Connectivity Analysis","sourcePdf":"joe-sandalidis-2291135-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034286S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","isNumber":"6913587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"29","articleId":"6704324","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6704330,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Wang","affiliation":["JGMT, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6730973/6704330/6704330-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hui Wang (S'11) was born in Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China, in 1987.

It is found that the TCSR can exhibit a maximum three poles and two zeros when open and short terminations are applied. The intrinsic zero is simply used for the implementation of notch bands offering systematic design and flexible tuning capabilities. Bandwidth can also be kept unchanged when tuning a notch within the UWB passband. In contrast to common band-notched UWB BPFs using additional notch resonators, only a single TCSR is required to realize band-notched UWB filters. Three UWB BPF prototypes, including a four-pole filter with 94.7% fractional bandwidth (FBW) and a notch band at 5.8 GHz, a five-pole filter with 111% FBW and dual notch bands at 4.3/9.1 GHz, and a four-pole filter with 82.4% FBW and reconfigurable notch band from 4.6 to 6.5 GHz are designed and experimentally characterized.

This paper presents a new approach to identify such systems which adapts dynamically to the sparseness level of the system and thus works well both in sparse and non-sparse environments. The proposed scheme uses an adaptive convex combination of the LMS algorithm and the recently proposed, sparsity-aware zero-attractor LMS (ZA-LMS) algorithm. It is shown that while for non-sparse systems, the proposed combined filter always converges to the LMS algorithm (which is better of the two filters for non-sparse case in terms of lesser steady state excess mean square error (EMSE)), for semi-sparse systems, on the other hand, it actually converges to a solution that produces lesser steady state EMSE than produced by either of the component filters. For highly sparse systems, depending on the value of a proportionality constant in the ZA-LMS algorithm, the proposed combined filter may either converge to the ZA-LMS based filter or may produce a solution which, like the semi-sparse case, outperforms both the constituent filters. A simplified update formula for the mixing parameter of the adaptive convex combination is also presented. The proposed algorithm requires much less complexity than the existing algorithms and its claimed robustness against variable sparsity is well supported by simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2013.2289407","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6805240/06704331.pdf","startPage":"1499","endPage":"1507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6805240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2013.2289407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Adaptive Filtering by an Adaptive Convex Combination of the LMS and the ZA-LMS Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Adaptive Filtering by an Adaptive Convex Combination of the LMS and the ZA-LMS Algorithms","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704331/","publicationDate":"May 2014","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14265390","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704331/","volume":"61","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Adaptive Filtering by an Adaptive Convex Combination of the LMS and the ZA-LMS Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tcsi-chakraborty-2289407-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092389S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6805240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6805240","articleId":"6704331","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6704398,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The proposed ANN model calculates distance with an average error of 7.31 cm.","doi":"10.1109/TELSKS.2013.6704428","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683940/6704397/06704428.pdf","startPage":"505","endPage":"508","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 11th International Conference on Telecommunications in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Services (TELSIKS)","publicationTitle":"2013 11th International Conference on Telecommunications in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Services (TELSIKS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TELSKS.2013.6704428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Networks for ranging of passive UHF RFID tags","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Networks for ranging of passive UHF RFID tags","isConference":true,"volume":"02","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14025095","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6704428/","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial Neural Networks for ranging of passive UHF RFID tags","confLoc":"Nis, Serbia","sourcePdf":"PO14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115053S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683940","isNumber":"6704397","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683940","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6704397","articleId":"6704428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6704429,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksandra \u0110ori\u0107","affiliation":["Innovation centre of advanced technology Ni\u0161, Serbia, Ni\u0161, Serbia"],"firstName":"Aleksandra","lastName":"\u0110ori\u0107","id":"37085618541"},{"name":"Nata\u0161a Male\u0161-Ili\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Ni\u0161, Ni\u0161, Serbia"],"firstName":"Nata\u0161a","lastName":"Male\u0161-Ili\u0107","id":"38276711200"},{"name":"Aleksandar Atanaskovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Ni\u0161, Ni\u0161, Serbia"],"firstName":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Atanaskovi\u0107","id":"37945052100"},{"name":"Bratislav Milovanovi\u0107","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Engineering, University of Ni\u0161, Ni\u0161, Serbia"],"firstName":"Bratislav","lastName":"Milovanovi\u0107","id":"37299972500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0902-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0899-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0900-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704429","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"abstract":"The linearization of broadband two-way Doherty amplifier for application in the frequency range 0.85-1.15GHz is considered in this paper.

Periodic sensing is commonly employed to facilitate spectrum handoff by improving sensing accuracy so that the secondary user has a better opportunity to avoid transmission collision via switching to a truly idle channel. However, byproducts of spectrum handoff, such as extra energy cost on channel switch, switch delay, and collisions due to excessive switch, have been largely underestimated. These by-products which have significant impacts on the overall performance lead to the questions: Should we switch the channel? How often should we switch? In this article we first review several different periodic sensing and handoff mechanisms. Then we identify the trade-off between the secondary user's energy efficiency and transmission reliability. The proposed switch-stay model is elaborated and studied to balance the aforementioned trade-off in light of sensing accuracy, the probability of collision, throughput and delay constraints. Upper and lower bounds of the stay probability on the current channel are illustrated from these constraints. In addition, we discuss the implementation of an antenna-selection sensing mechanism in order to relax these bounds for a better energy-efficient spectrum management solution. Performance evaluation and some open issues are also discussed in this article.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2013","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"13998610","htmlLink":"/document/6704469/","displayDocTitle":"Reliable energy-efficient spectrum management and optimization in cognitive radio networks: how often should we switch?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable energy-efficient spectrum management and optimization in cognitive radio networks: how often should we switch?","sourcePdf":"005WANG1_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058512S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6704464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6704464","articleId":"6704469","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6704470,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangqian Zhu","affiliation":["China academy of telecommunications technology and datang telecom technology & industry group"],"bio":{"p":["Xiangqian Zhu received his B.S. degree from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2003, and his M.S. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), China, in 2006.

As the most general networking architecture, ad hoc network has long been regarded as the most challenging to design and quantify, due to the possible hybrid component settings and heterogeneous node behaviors there. Toward this end, we review the current state of the art of analytical models and techniques developed for performance analysis in ad hoc networks. Specifically, we discuss modeling techniques related to the fundamental topics in ad hoc network research: node mobility, wireless interference, node spatial distribution, and information delivery process. Besides discussions of advantages and limitations of available models, promising future research directions are also outlined.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2013.6704474","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2013.6704474","startPage":"51","endPage":"58","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/6704464/06704474.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward modeling ad hoc networks: current situation and future direction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","displayDocTitle":"Toward modeling ad hoc networks: current situation and future direction","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","volume":"20","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704474/","accessionNumber":"13998607","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704474/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward modeling ad hoc networks: current situation and future direction","sourcePdf":"010LIU1_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061476S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6704464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6704464","articleId":"6704474","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6704475,"authors":[{"name":"Julio Soto","affiliation":["Federal University of Parana"],"bio":{"p":["Julio Soto holds a Master's degree in computer science from the Federal University of Paran (UFPR), Brazil.

Malicious or selfish secondary users pretend legitimate primary users to profit from the opportunistic use of the licensed frequency spectrum. Since cognitive radio importance has enhanced as an approach to spectral efficiency and to diminish the negative effects of wireless network scalability, approaches for PUEAs defense have arisen, evolving their architectural strategy, node's operation and analysis design. This article overviews recent achievement in PUEA defenses and presents a classification. Persistently unsolved challenges in the field are highlighted, and a framework for tackling one of the main challenges - the lack of flexibility to address this highly compromising attack - is outlined, promoting progress in the art of PUEA defense. As proof of concept, results present improvements in attack analysis employing flexible and multidimensional techniques on a case study.

As a result it is predicted that intelligent devices and networks, such as WSNs, will not be isolated, but connected and integrated, composing computer networks. So far, the IP-based Internet is the largest network in the world; therefore, there are great strides to connect WSNs with the Internet. To this end, the IETF has developed a suite of protocols and open standards for accessing applications and services for wireless resource constrained networks. However, many open challenges remain, mostly due to the complex deployment characteristics of such systems and the stringent requirements imposed by various services wishing to make use of such complex systems. Thus, it becomes critically important to study how the current approaches to standardization in this area can be improved, and at the same time better understand the opportunities for the research community to contribute to the IoT field. To this end, this article presents an overview of current standards and research activities in both industry and academia.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704479/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","volume":"20","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14035269","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6704479/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A survey on the ietf protocol suite for the internet of things: standards, challenges, and opportunities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey on the ietf protocol suite for the internet of things: standards, challenges, and opportunities","sourcePdf":"015YANG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053913S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6704464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"497","xplore-issue":"6704464","articleId":"6704479","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6704480,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Li","affiliation":["Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Columbia University"],"bio":{"p":["Yun Li received his Ph.D. degree in communication engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.

In a few years, the number of deployed femtocell base stations (FBSs) will reach hundreds of millions. This huge deployment will bring a lot of challenges in terms of interference management, resource scheduling, and energy consumption. In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to energy-efficient communications. The huge number of deployed FBSs will aggravate energy consumption. In this article, we comprehensively survey the related work on energy efficiency issues in femtocell networks, including energy efficiency metrics, energy consumption models, deployments of femtocells, and energy-efficient schemes. Then a simple sleeping scheme, fixed time sleeping, is presented as a case study for saving the energy of FBSs. Some interesting results are also presented to show that fixed time sleeping makes a good trade-off among energy efficiency, actual waiting time, and call loss.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/6704464/06704480.pdf","startPage":"99","endPage":"105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2013.6704480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2013.6704480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704464","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient femtocell networks: challenges and opportunities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Power control","Energy consumption","Macrocell networks","Femtocell networks","Interference","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","femtocellular radio","next generation networks","quality of service","radio networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient femtocell networks","next generation wireless networks","cellular networks","transmission power","user equipments","spectrum efficiency","femtocell base stations","interference management","resource scheduling","energy efficiency metrics","energy consumption models","simple sleeping scheme","fixed time sleeping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704480/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2013","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient femtocell networks: challenges and opportunities","volume":"20","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6704480/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"13998605","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient femtocell networks: challenges and opportunities","sourcePdf":"016WANG2_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064198S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"6704464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6704464","articleId":"6704480","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6704481,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Liu","affiliation":["SHANGHAI JIAO TONG UNIVERSITY"],"bio":{"p":["Bo Liu [m] received his B.S. in 2004 from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China.

We propose a novel method to scale the energy and processing throughput of GEMM and CONV kernels for such error-tolerant multimedia applications by adjusting the precision of computation. Our technique employs linear projections to the input matrix or signal data during the top-level GEMM and CONV blocking and reordering. The GEMM and CONV kernel processing then uses the projected inputs and the results are accumulated to form the final outputs. Throughput and energy scaling takes place by decreasing the number of projections computed by each kernel, which in turn produces approximate results, i.e. lowers the precision of the performed computation. Existing realizations of error-tolerant multimedia applications can opt to utilize a small number of the input projections (typically just one) in order to save energy and processing cycles, while all error-intolerant systems can compute all input projections and obtain full-precision outputs. Results derived from a voltage- and frequency-scaled ARM Cortex A15 processor running face recognition demonstrate that the proposed approach allows for 5-fold to 10-fold increase of processing throughput and more than 80% decrease of energy consumption against optimized GEMM and CONV kernels without any impact in the expected recognition and matching precision.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026315","htmlLink":"/document/6704499/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Precision-energy-throughput scaling of generic matrix multiplication and discrete convolution kernels via linear projections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precision-energy-throughput scaling of generic matrix multiplication and discrete convolution kernels via linear projections","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"7021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.145494S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689794","isNumber":"6704489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689794","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6704489","articleId":"6704499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6704502,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Schor","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Schor","id":"37670161100"},{"name":"Andreas Tretter","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Tretter","id":"38466837300"},{"name":"Tobias Scherer","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Scherer","id":"37086685408"},{"name":"Lothar Thiele","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Computer Engineering and Networks Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Lothar","lastName":"Thiele","id":"37274921100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1284-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-1271"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"}],"articleNumber":"6704502","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":266},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704502","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel processing","Kernel","Graphics processing units","Hardware","Programming","Random access memory","Ports (Computers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","data flow graphs","parallel programming","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous system programming","synchronous dataflow graph","OpenCL","common low-level API","data transfer","task scheduling","synchronization","SDF","memory access latency","multilevel parallelism","pipeline parallelism","task parallelism","SIMD"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic synthesis","dataflow languages","heterogenous systems","OpenCL","SDF graphs"]}],"abstract":"Programming heterogeneous systems has been greatly simplified by OpenCL, which provides a common low-level API for a large variety of compute devices. However, many low-level details, including data transfer, task scheduling, or synchronization, must still be managed by the application designer. Often, it is desirable to program heterogeneous systems in a higher-level language, making the developing process faster and less error-prone. In this paper, we introduce a framework to efficiently execute applications specified as synchronous dataflow graphs (SDF) on heterogeneous systems by means of OpenCL. In our approach, actors are embedded into OpenCL kernels and data channels are automatically instantiated to improve memory access latencies and end-to-end performance. The multi-level parallelism resulting from the hierarchical structure of heterogeneous systems is exploited by applying two techniques. Pipeline and task parallelism are used to distribute the application to the different compute devices and data-parallelism is used to concurrently process independent actor firings or even output tokens in a SIMD fashion. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can be used by application designers to efficiently exploit the parallelism of heterogeneous systems without writing low-level architecture dependent code.","doi":"10.1109/ESTIMedia.2013.6704502","publicationTitle":"The 11th IEEE Symposium on Embedded Systems for Real-time Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"The 11th IEEE Symposium on Embedded Systems for Real-time Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689794/6704489/06704502.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTIMedia.2013.6704502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting the parallelism of heterogeneous systems using dataflow graphs on top of OpenCL","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting the parallelism of heterogeneous systems using dataflow graphs on top of OpenCL","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6704502/","accessionNumber":"14026320","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting the parallelism of heterogeneous systems using dataflow graphs on top of OpenCL","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"7041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065701S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689794","isNumber":"6704489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689794","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6704489","articleId":"6704502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":6704507,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Mao Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Kai-Mao Cheng","id":"37086749906"},{"name":"Cheng-Yen Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Yen Lin","id":"37404183000"},{"name":"Yu-Chun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Chun Chen","id":"37086750746"},{"name":"Te-Feng Su","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Te-Feng Su","id":"37707658000"},{"name":"Shang-Hong Lai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shang-Hong Lai","id":"37270079400"},{"name":"Jenq-Kuen Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jenq-Kuen Lee","id":"37280319900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1284-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-1271"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2325-1301"}],"articleNumber":"6704507","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":491},"abstract":"Vehicle detection methods are playing an important role for driver assistance systems. Developing a high accuracy and efficiency vehicle detection system thus becomes crucial. One of the popular approaches is the scanning method which is based on the sliding window search for locating the vehicles from the input images. Such method provides a high detection rate with a time consuming process that identifies the vehicle from each sliding window. The searching time can be unacceptable as the searching space grows. This raises an optimization opportunity to exploit modern heterogeneous multicore system to accelerate the vehicle detection process. In this paper, we present a case study to accelerate a sliding-window based vehicle detection algorithm on a heterogeneous multicore systems using OpenCL designs. Unlike transitional detection algorithm, we integrate width model into our vehicle detection method to reduce search space. We give a detail execution profiling on each component of original vehicle detection algorithm and explore the potential parallelism. The experiment is based on a heterogeneous multicore platform that includes an Intel i5-2400 processor and a AMD HD6670 GPU. Also an Open64-based OpenCL compiler is employed to compile the cl code for the GPU. Significant performance speed-up is achieved with our parallelization and optimization, the maximum speed-up for the vehicle detection kernel and whole application is 17.1 and 16.7 respectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Support vector machines","Vehicle detection","Kernel","Training","Vectors","Graphics processing units"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver information systems","graphics processing units","multiprocessing systems","object detection","open systems","program compilers","road vehicles","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle detection kernel","parallelization","Open64-based OpenCL compiler","AMD HD6670 GPU","Intel i5-2400 processor","heterogeneous multicore platform","execution profiling","search space","transitional detection algorithm","OpenCL designs","heterogeneous multicore systems","sliding-window based vehicle detection algorithm","vehicle detection process","optimization opportunity","searching space","searching time","time consuming process","detection rate","sliding window","scanning method","vehicle detection system","driver assistance systems","OpenCL programming","vehicle detection method design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704507","doi":"10.1109/ESTIMedia.2013.6704507","displayPublicationTitle":"The 11th IEEE Symposium on Embedded Systems for Real-time Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689794/6704489/06704507.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTIMedia.2013.6704507","startPage":"88","endPage":"95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704489","publicationTitle":"The 11th IEEE Symposium on Embedded Systems for Real-time Multimedia","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of vehicle detection methods with OpenCL programming on multi-core systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design of vehicle detection methods with OpenCL programming on multi-core systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704507/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704507/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026306","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of vehicle detection methods with OpenCL programming on multi-core systems","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"7088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070541S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689794","isNumber":"6704489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689794","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6704489","articleId":"6704507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6704510,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Quan","affiliation":["Informatics Institute, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Quan","id":"37070899900"},{"name":"Andy D.

The problem of optimally mapping tasks onto a set of given heterogeneous processors for maximal throughput/minimal overall energy consumption has been known, in general, to be NP-complete. This problem is exacerbated when mapping multiple applications onto the target platform. To address this problem, this paper proposes an iterative multi-application mapping algorithm that operates at run time. Based on statically derived optimal (or near optimal) mappings for each separate application, this algorithm will quickly find a near optimal mapping under the objectives of high performance and low energy consumption for the simultaneously running applications on heterogeneous platforms. We have evaluated our algorithm using a heterogeneous MPSoC system with three real applications. Experimental results reveal the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm by comparing derived solutions to the ones obtained from other well-known algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An iterative multi-application mapping algorithm for heterogeneous MPSoCs","publicationTitle":"The 11th IEEE Symposium on Embedded Systems for Real-time Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/ESTIMedia.2013.6704510","displayPublicationTitle":"The 11th IEEE Symposium on Embedded Systems for Real-time Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689794/6704489/06704510.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"124","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTIMedia.2013.6704510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704489","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"An iterative multi-application mapping algorithm for heterogeneous MPSoCs","conferenceDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704510/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026321","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An iterative multi-application mapping algorithm for heterogeneous MPSoCs","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"7115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075911S","chronDate":"3-4 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689794","isNumber":"6704489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689794","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6704489","articleId":"6704510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6704519,"authors":[{"name":"Shiunn-Jang Chern","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, New Taipei City, Taiwan R.O.C"],"firstName":"Shiunn-Jang","lastName":"Chern","id":"37339011400"},{"name":"Che-Wei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, New Taipei City, Taiwan R.O.C"],"firstName":"Che-Wei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086719876"},{"name":"Ching-Tang Hsieh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, New Taipei City, Taiwan R.O.C"],"firstName":"Ching-Tang","lastName":"Hsieh","id":"37334626800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6361-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6360-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704519","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"abstract":"Compressive sensing (CS) is an innovative approach for the acquisition of signals having a sparse or compressible representation in some basis.

The AEC cancels the acoustic echoes by approximating the echo-path with the use of an adaptive filter and subtracting the pseudo echoes generated by the filter from the observed signal. The conventional adaptive algorithm for updating the filter, however, fails in estimation of the echo-path during double-talk when both the acoustic echo and the near-end speech are observed. Recently it has been shown that the blind source separation (BSS) can be employed to perform the echo cancelation during the double-talk; however, the convergence speed is slower than that of the conventional method. In this paper, a system is proposed that combines the conventional AEC and BSS; essentially, BSS is employed as a preprocessor for the adaptive filter performing the echo cancelation.

Conducted simulations show that the proposed GA-based approach outperforms some representative previous works with modest computational load.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704526","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691895/6704511/06704526.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704511","startPage":"85","endPage":"90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power allocation and subcarrier pairing in OFDM-based Decode-and-Forward relay networks based on a genetic approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704526","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power allocation and subcarrier pairing in OFDM-based Decode-and-Forward relay networks based on a genetic approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704526/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14035594","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6704526/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power allocation and subcarrier pairing in OFDM-based Decode-and-Forward relay networks based on a genetic approach","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"016WM1D3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063267S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691895","isNumber":"6704511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691895","xplore-issue":"6704511","articleId":"6704526","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6704527,"authors":[{"name":"Yihenew Wondie Marye","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Kumamoto University"],"firstName":"Yihenew Wondie","lastName":"Marye","id":"37074234900"},{"name":"Rong Sun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Kumamoto University"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Sun","id":"37074811800"},{"name":"Hua-An Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Kumamoto University"],"firstName":"Hua-An","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085890972"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6361-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6360-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704527","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704527","abstract":"Cooperative communications is an attractive feature for the upcoming high speed wireless networks. It provides diversity for devices that are incapable of harboring multiple antennae by emulating multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system providing virtual antenna array. There are different strategies of cooperation already such as amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). Although the implementation of these strategies is simple, their utilization of the channel state information (CSI) for performance improvement is generally poor. As a result, alternative strategies are required to improve the throughput while keeping the outage and bit error rate (BER) low. In this paper an approach, based on previously existing strategies, called CSI directed estimate and forward (CDEF) strategy is proposed to improve throughput at low outage probability. It will be shown that this new strategy attains better BER and outage performances compared to AF and DF. Simulation results also show that it has better throughput performance at low outage probability as well.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704511","startPage":"91","endPage":"96","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691895/6704511/06704527.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low outage probability throughput improvement for cooperative wireless networks by utilizing channel state information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Throughput","Bit error rate","Protocols","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","antenna arrays","cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","error statistics","MIMO communication","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low outage probability throughput improvement","cooperative wireless networks","channel state information","cooperative communications","virtual antenna array","multiple-input-multiple-output system","amplify-and-forward","decode-and-forward","bit error rate","CSI directed estimate and forward strategy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Low outage probability throughput improvement for cooperative wireless networks by utilizing channel state information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704527/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704527/","accessionNumber":"14027013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low outage probability throughput improvement for cooperative wireless networks by utilizing channel state information","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"017WM1D4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061219S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691895","isNumber":"6704511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691895","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6704511","articleId":"6704527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6704530,"authors":[{"name":"I-Cheng Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Nantou, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"I-Cheng","lastName":"Liu","id":"38547763900"},{"name":"Shih-Chun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Nantou, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Shih-Chun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086778594"},{"name":"Jung-Shan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chi Nan University, Puli, Nantou, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Jung-Shan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37349894800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6361-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6360-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704530","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":123},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Noise","Frequency-domain analysis","Discrete Fourier transforms","Time-domain analysis","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","OFDM modulation","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified DFT-based channel estimation technique","TDS-OFDM communication systems","time domain synchronous communication systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing communication systems","channel tap detector scheme","average noise power estimation","SCTD threshold estimation error","loss path information","performance degradation","channel impulse response estimation","bit error rate performance improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["TDS-OFDM systems","DFT-based channel estimation","SCTD","DTTB"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes the modified discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based channel estimation technique for time domain synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (TDS-OFDM) communication systems.

Then, the bit error rate performance is evaluated using computer simulations.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704554","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691895/6704511/06704554.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"244","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on a multi-user single-carrier E-SDM scheme in wideband transmissions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A study on a multi-user single-carrier E-SDM scheme in wideband transmissions","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6704554/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14035593","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704554/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on a multi-user single-carrier E-SDM scheme in wideband transmissions","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"044WA1E2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042646S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691895","isNumber":"6704511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691895","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6704511","articleId":"6704554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6704555,"authors":[{"name":"Wataru Fukuda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Wataru","lastName":"Fukuda","id":"37973080700"},{"name":"Takashi Abiko","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Abiko","id":"37086771054"},{"name":"Toshihiko Nishimura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshihiko","lastName":"Nishimura","id":"37287475700"},{"name":"Takeo Ohgane","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeo","lastName":"Ohgane","id":"37284385100"},{"name":"Yasutaka Ogawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasutaka","lastName":"Ogawa","id":"37280241700"},{"name":"Yusuke Ohwatari","affiliation":["NTT DOCOMO, INC., Yokosuka-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Ohwatari","id":"37294395700"},{"name":"Yoshihisa Kishiyama","affiliation":["NTT DOCOMO, INC., Yokosuka-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihisa","lastName":"Kishiyama","id":"37299879400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6361-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6360-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704555","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":542},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","MIMO","Bit error rate","Convergence","Belief propagation","Reliability","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","interference suppression","MIMO communication","receiving antennas","signal detection","space division multiplexing","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complexity reduction","massive MIMO system","multiple-input multiple-output system","transmitting antenna","receiving antenna","spatially-multiplexed signal detection","belief propagation","parallel interference canceller","BER performance"]}],"abstract":"The easiest way to improve the throughput performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is to increase the number of both transmit and receive antennas. Thus, a massive MIMO concept has been proposed recently. In general, however, algorithms detecting spatially-multiplexed signals require the complexity to be proportional to the cubed power of the number of antenna elements at least. Several studies have shown that a detection based on belief propagation with a parallel interference canceller is implementable in the order of the second power of the number of elements and achieves very good BER performance. For further reduction of complexity, we apply layered belief propagation, forced convergence, and node selection methods to the belief propagation based detection. The results show that the layered belief propagation can halve the complexity without performance degradation.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704555","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691895/6704511/06704555.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity reduction for signal detection based on belief propagation in a massive MIMO system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704555/","displayDocTitle":"Complexity reduction for signal detection based on belief propagation in a massive MIMO system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027017","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704555/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity reduction for signal detection based on belief propagation in a massive MIMO system","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"045WA1E3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070734S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691895","isNumber":"6704511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691895","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6704511","articleId":"6704555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6704556,"authors":[{"name":"Jueun Bak","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jueun","lastName":"Bak","id":"37086655210"},{"name":"Wookbong Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Wookbong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37291455200"},{"name":"Haewook Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Haewook","lastName":"Park","id":"37535513100"},{"name":"Inkyu Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Inkyu","lastName":"Lee","id":"37279664500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6361-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6360-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704556","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Femtocell networks","Array signal processing","Vectors","Optimization","Silicon compounds","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","femtocellular radio","interference suppression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Interference mitigation techniques","femtocell networks","low-power femto base stations","macrocellular systems","distributed beamforming technique","Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions"]}],"abstract":"In femtocell networks, low-cost and low-power femto base stations are overlaid on macro cellular systems, and thereby interference between the femtocell to the macrocell becomes a major obstacle.

MIMO receivers suffer from performance degradation due to the noise enhancement caused by the severe channel matrices. Precoding schemes, such as spatial Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP), can mitigate the performance degradation; however, the effect upon the highly correlated channels is insufficient. One way to avoid the noise enhancement is to turn off a few substreams related to the poor MIMO channels, which becomes possible by introducing an appropriate permutation matrix. We formulate a bit rate on the zero-forcing THP (ZF-THP) MIMO system, which shows that there is an optimum permutation matrix which maximizes the bit rate. We propose to apply a modified version of the sorted decomposition (SQRD) algorithm, which was originally developed for Vertical Bell Labs Layered Space Time (V-BLAST) receiver to carry out the QR decomposition of a MIMO channel matrix with permutation in its column direction simultaneously, to find a feasible permutation and create a precoder. Finally, it results in developing an efficient scheme to turn off the substreams. The proposed scheme is evaluated by computer simulations to verify its efficiency upon the correlated MIMO channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704557/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704557/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027007","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Tomlinson-Harashima precoding for correlated MIMO channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Tomlinson-Harashima precoding for correlated MIMO channels","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"047WA1E5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077466S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691895","isNumber":"6704511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691895","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6704511","articleId":"6704557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6704558,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Hsien Hsia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chinese Culture University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Hsien","lastName":"Hsia","id":"37271479000"},{"name":"Wei-Han Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Han","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085571906"},{"name":"Hsin-Ting Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hsin-Ting","lastName":"Li","id":"38565099200"},{"name":"Jen-Shiun Chiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tamkang University, New Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Shiun","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37271474300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6361-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6360-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704558","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smoothing methods","Discrete wavelet transforms","Information filters","Image resolution","Color","Adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","image texture","rendering (computer graphics)","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vertical texture","adaptive edge-oriented smoothing process","computing time","DIBR system","corresponding 2-D depth map","2-D color image","3-D image","wavelet transform","depth image based rendering","spatial domain complexity reduction method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DIBR","DWT","Symmetric Smoothing Filter","Asymmetric Smoothing Filter","Image Warping"]}],"abstract":"Depth Image Based Rendering (DIBR) is an approach to generate a 3-D image by the original 2-D color image with the corresponding 2-D depth map.

MIMO-OFDM achieves large-capacity wireless communication, and has been adopted in such as IEEE802.11n/ac standard wireless LAN systems. PAPR indicates the ratio of peak power to average power. High PAPR causes waveform distortion due to nonlinear amplifier characteristics. PTS is one of PAPR reduction methods to prevent communication quality degradation. PTS performs phase rotation to OFDM modulated signals to reduce the peak power. We have to increase the number of possible phase patterns in order to obtain enough PAPR reduction. Coded PTS is used to reduce computational cost of PTS by using codebook. In the case of MIMO-OFDM systems, we have to use the same phase pattern of PTS for each stream due to difficulty of detection. In this paper, we have evaluated PAPR reduction by the proposed coded PTS in 8\u00d78 MIMO-OFDM systems. The evaluation result shows that low error transmission can be achieved by using coded PTS and RS code, and PAPR reduction is about 1.7 dB. In comparison with PTS, coded PTS can achieve 94% computational cost reduction.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study of PAPR reduction using coded PTS in 8\u00d78 MIMO-OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704577","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691895/6704511/06704577.pdf","startPage":"363","endPage":"368","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704577","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704577/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Study of PAPR reduction using coded PTS in 8\u00d78 MIMO-OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704577/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027026","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of PAPR reduction using coded PTS in 8\u00d78 MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"067WA2E2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088002S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691895","isNumber":"6704511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691895","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6704511","articleId":"6704577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6704578,"authors":[{"name":"Shiunn-Jang Chern","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Tamkang University, New Taipei City, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Shiunn-Jang","lastName":"Chern","id":"37339011400"},{"name":"Wang-Chih Huang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Tamkang University, New Taipei City, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Wang-Chih","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086672077"},{"name":"Richard Hsin-Hsyong Yang","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Tamkang University, New Taipei City, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Richard Hsin-Hsyong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37420810200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6361-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6360-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704578","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Receivers","Multiaccess communication","Channel estimation","Filter banks","Transceivers","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel bank filters","channel estimation","code division multiple access","MIMO communication","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference","receiving antennas","space-time block codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive semiblind channel estimation","ST-BC MIMO-CDMA systems","hybrid user signature","semiblind transceiver","direct-sequence code division multiple access","DS-CDMA system","multiple transmit and receive antennas","MIMO system","space-time block code","transmitter","hybrid augmented user signature","prefix/postfix zero-padding sequences","transmit-antennas","phase ambiguity problem","blind receivers","Capon-like semiblind two-branch filter bank receiver","linearly constrained constant modulus","LCCM criterion","AUS-assisted semi-blind channel estimation","power method","block symbol recovery","inter-block interference","multiple access interference","ST-BC MIMO-CDMA receiver","two-branch filterbank","generalized sidelobe canceller","adaptive semiblind LCCM receiver","intense simulations","user's acquisition","phase ambiguity problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WCDMA","Capon receiver","space-time block code","MIMO","hybrid user signature","zero-padding","GSC-RLS algorthm"]}],"abstract":"We extend our previous work to present a new semi-blind transceiver for the direct-sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system that uses multiple transmit and receive antennas (MIMO) system, equipped with space-time block code (ST-BC). In the transmitter we design a new hybrid augmented user signature (AUS) that composes of the desired user signatures and the prefix/postfix zero-padding sequences with respect to individual transmit-antennas. The hybrid AUS is devised to resolve the phase ambiguity problem which occurs in all blind receivers. At the receiver we propose a Capon-like semi-blind two-branch filter bank receiver, based on the linearly constrained constant modulus (LCCM) criterion, followed by the AUS-assisted semi-blind channel estimation and power method for block symbol recovery. This enables us to partially alleviate the effects of inter-block interference (IBI) and the multiple access interference (MAI). In the ST-BC MIMO-CDMA receiver with two-branch filterbank, we build on the generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) structure with the RLS for implementing the adaptive semi-blind LCCM receiver. Via intense simulations it reveals that our proposed new transceiver has robust performance against the user's acquisition inaccuracies comparing with current available algorithms and to resolve the phase ambiguity problem.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive semi-blind channel estimation for ST-BC MIMO-CDMA systems with hybrid user signature","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704578","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691895/6704511/06704578.pdf","startPage":"369","endPage":"374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704578","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704578/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive semi-blind channel estimation for ST-BC MIMO-CDMA systems with hybrid user signature","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704578/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027008","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive semi-blind channel estimation for ST-BC MIMO-CDMA systems with hybrid user signature","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"068WA2E3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06775S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691895","isNumber":"6704511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691895","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6704511","articleId":"6704578","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6704579,"authors":[{"name":"Shoya Takebuchi","affiliation":["Graduated School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shoya","lastName":"Takebuchi","id":"38247073200"},{"name":"Hiromichi Tomeba","affiliation":["Graduated School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromichi","lastName":"Tomeba","id":"37294909200"},{"name":"Takashi Onodera","affiliation":["Corporate Research and Development Division, Sharp Corporation"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Onodera","id":"37669725000"},{"name":"Minoru Kubota","affiliation":["Corporate Research and Development Division, Sharp Corporation"],"firstName":"Minoru","lastName":"Kubota","id":"37085559118"},{"name":"Fumiaki Maehara","affiliation":["Graduated School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiaki","lastName":"Maehara","id":"37298056500"},{"name":"Fumio Takahata","affiliation":["Graduated School of Fundamental Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumio","lastName":"Takahata","id":"37281535500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6361-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6360-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704579","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase shift keying","MIMO","Vectors","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","channel capacity","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","packet radio networks","precoding","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","ARQ","modulo loss reduction","multi-user MIMO systems","Tomlinson-Harashima precoding","system capacity","wireless systems","wireless packet transmission","high-capacity wireless transmissions","packet combining scheme","computer simulations"]}],"abstract":"Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) using Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) has great potential to achieve high system capacity in wireless systems. On the other hand, hybrid ARQ (HARQ) is essential to realize the reliable wireless packet transmission and therefore, the combination of THP with HARQ can be seen as a promising approach to achieve reliable high-capacity wireless transmissions. However, this combination has a problem of severe performance degradation due to the accumulation of modulo loss which is the inherent drawback of THP. In this paper, we propose the HARQ scheme to cancel the accumulation of modulo loss in Multi-user MIMO THP systems. The main feature of the proposed approach is to add the same perturbation vector as the initial transmit packet to the retransmit packets in order to prevent the accumulation of modulo loss. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in comparison with the conventional packet combining scheme by means of computer simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid ARQ for modulo loss reduction in multi-user MIMO THP systems","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704579","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691895/6704511/06704579.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid ARQ for modulo loss reduction in multi-user MIMO THP systems","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704579/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026970","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid ARQ for modulo loss reduction in multi-user MIMO THP systems","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"069WA2E4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047436S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691895","isNumber":"6704511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691895","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6704511","articleId":"6704579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6704585,"authors":[{"name":"MinZhi Chua","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Shinshu University, Japan"],"firstName":"MinZhi","lastName":"Chua","id":"37086721854"},{"name":"Youhei Akimoto","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Shinshu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Youhei","lastName":"Akimoto","id":"37085592213"},{"name":"Hernan Aguirre","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Shinshu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hernan","lastName":"Aguirre","id":"37276145500"},{"name":"Kiyoshi Tanaka","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Shinshu University, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyoshi","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"37085763913"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6361-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6360-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704585","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Image reconstruction","Principal component analysis","Testing","Support vector machines","Training","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","face recognition","image classification","image reconstruction","learning (artificial intelligence)","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Asian female face classification","personal attractive preference","PCA eigenface reconstruction","PCA-based method","face image training","general face information","reconstructed image similarity","confidence level","Wilcoxon signed-rank test","3-class classification","principle component analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["face classification","personal attractive preference","Asian female faces","similarity measurement","PCA","image reconstruction"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an Asian female face classification that incorporates personal attractive preference utilizing the reconstruction of PCA eigenface.

In previous literature, it has been shown that trellis coded modulation (TCM) can enhance system capability to separate signal streams at detection process in MIMO systems. However, the computational complexity remains high as a maximum likelihood detection (MLD) algorithm is used in the scheme. Thus, a sphere decoding (SD) algorithm with a pseudo distance (PD) is proposed in this paper. It is shown that the proposed scheme can reduce the number of distance calculations by about 98% for the transmission of 3 signal streams.

paper investigates the elevation directional channel properties at a base station (BS) based on ray-tracing simulation to evaluate the performance of 3D beamforming that controls the main beam direction of a BS antenna over both the azimuth dimension and elevation dimension. Results show that the average power elevation spectrum (PES) and the distribution of the elevation angular spread at BS do not depend on the BS antenna height. Moreover, we confirmed that when a mobile station (MS) exists in the vicinity of a BS in a line of sight (LOS) situation, the more the BS antenna height decreases, the more the elevation angular spread increases. Furthermore, the dispersion of the elevation median angle at BS is small compared to that for the azimuth case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704627/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14027009","htmlLink":"/document/6704627/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Elevation directional channel properties at BS to evaluate 3D beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elevation directional channel properties at BS to evaluate 3D beamforming","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"121FM1E2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123653S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691895","isNumber":"6704511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691895","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6704511","articleId":"6704627","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6704628,"authors":[{"name":"Shingo Yoshizawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Kitami Institute of Technology, Kitami, Japan"],"firstName":"Shingo","lastName":"Yoshizawa","id":"37270688500"},{"name":"Yasuyuki Hatakawa","affiliation":["KDDI R & D Laboratories Inc., Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasuyuki","lastName":"Hatakawa","id":"37282451600"},{"name":"Tomoko Matsumoto","affiliation":["KDDI R & D Laboratories Inc., Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoko","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37535708500"},{"name":"Satoshi Konishi","affiliation":["KDDI R & D Laboratories Inc., Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Konishi","id":"37266090500"},{"name":"Yoshikazu Miyanaga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information and Science Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshikazu","lastName":"Miyanaga","id":"37270680800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6361-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6360-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704628","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Computer architecture","Throughput","OFDM","Receivers","Decoding","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","interference suppression","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware implementation","interference canceller","IDMA wireless communications","machine to machine communication","interleave division multiple access","dual frame processing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704628","abstract":"Due to the increasing demand for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, a wireless system which realizes simultaneous communication of small-sized packets for a large number of users is requested.

One key parameter that influences the energy efficiency is peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). PAPR is particularly revelant for cheap mass market terminals. In the most recent cellular standard, Long Term Evolution, different waveforms are used in downlink and uplink transmission, to address the issue of nonlinear distortions as a consequence of high PAPR. In this work, generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) is explored as a possible, non-orthogonal waveform for next generation cellular systems. Particular focus lies on the PAPR properties of the generated waveform. First, various filtered multi-carrier techniques, including OFDM, SC-FDE and GFDM, are presented in an unified framework. Second, the PAPR of those schemes is compared in an uplink multiple access scenario. The results show that a non-orthogonal waveform brings additional degrees of freedom, which can be beneficial.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704629","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691895/6704511/06704629.pdf","startPage":"651","endPage":"655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low peak-to-average power ratio for next generation cellular systems with generalized frequency division multiplexing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704629/","displayDocTitle":"Low peak-to-average power ratio for next generation cellular systems with generalized frequency division multiplexing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026995","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704629/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low peak-to-average power ratio for next generation cellular systems with generalized frequency division multiplexing","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"123FM1E4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043615S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691895","isNumber":"6704511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691895","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6704511","articleId":"6704629","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6704630,"authors":[{"name":"Trio Adiono","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Trio","lastName":"Adiono","id":"37370695100"},{"name":"Nana Sutisna","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Nana","lastName":"Sutisna","id":"37085536057"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6361-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6360-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704630","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Transmitters","Receivers","Digital signal processing","Pipelines","WiMAX","Data processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","radio transceivers","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible WiMAX OFDMA baseband transceiver","VLSI architecture design","physical layer","PHY","data processing speed","software access","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WiMAX OFDMA","VLSI Architecture","Design Framework","Flexible","Re-configurable"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a design framework for VLSI architecture design of WiMAX OFDMA Baseband Transceiver (Physical layer - PHY).

However, the interference of heart sound (HS) usually occurs and raises confusion on pathological state during the LS recording. To solve this question, separation of HS and LS from mixed heart-lung sound (HLS) has become one of major issues in the biomedical research. A novel approach based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) as one of blind source separation (BSS) techniques is proposed. In this paper, the chosen and enhanced mixed HLS signal is brought to the time-frequency domain and forms a multivariate data stationary time series. This multivariate data are then processed for dimension reduction by constant Q transform, which is well known as log-frequency STFT. The result of log-frequency STFT is then used as the input pattern of NMF. The average performance for quantitative evaluation of the proposed NMF-based approach is above 80% and better than the directly applied NMF.

However, the conventional optical PN codes are not suitable for optical N-CSK with IM/DD because the ratio of the number of PN codes and the PN-code length, M/L, is smaller than 1/\u221aL. Therefore, one of serious problems encountered with optical wireless N-CSK with IM/DD is to design the optical PN code. In this paper, a PN code, which combines the generalized modified prime sequence code (GMPSC) with Hadamard code, is proposed. Moreover, a new N-CSK using the proposed PN code is shown. The proposed PN code can achieve M/L = 1. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed system can achieve high data transmission rate compared with the conventional optical N-CSK systems. Moreover, the bit error rate performance is evaluated under the additive white Gaussian noise channel. It is found that the proposed optical N-CSK outperforms the conventional optical N-CSK system.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704647","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691895/6704511/06704647.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704511","startPage":"737","endPage":"742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical N-parallel codes-shift-keying using generalized modified prime sequence codes and Hadamard codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optical N-parallel codes-shift-keying using generalized modified prime sequence codes and Hadamard codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704647/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026976","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6704647/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical N-parallel codes-shift-keying using generalized modified prime sequence codes and Hadamard codes","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"141FM2D1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047428S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691895","isNumber":"6704511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691895","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6704511","articleId":"6704647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6704649,"authors":[{"name":"Yeon Ho Chung","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communications Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, Korea"],"firstName":"Yeon Ho","lastName":"Chung","id":"37279793600"},{"name":"Se-bin Oh","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communications Engineering, Pukyong National University, Busan, Korea"],"firstName":"Se-bin","lastName":"Oh","id":"37086753168"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6361-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6360-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704649","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":792},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical filters","Noise","Filtering","Optical pulses","Optical receivers","Optical noise","Optical films"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication","optical filters","photodiodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outdoor visible light communication","sunlight","articifical light","optical filtering method","VLC link","photodiode","light noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LED","VLC","Optical Filtering","Sunlight"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704649","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704511","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691895/6704511/06704649.pdf","startPage":"749","endPage":"752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient optical filtering for outdoor visible light communications in the presence of sunlight or articifical light","abstract":"An efficient optical filtering method for blocking outdoor light noise at visible light communication (VLC) systems has been presented.

The experimental system demonstrates that the optical filtering method blocks nearly all light noise incident from an angle of 30\u00b0 or higher.

Clipping can efficiently reduce Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR), improve Signal-to-Noise power Ratio (SNR) by compensating the reduced transmit power, and prevent the necessity of estimating the bias value added at the transmitter to keep the signal real-positive. Besides, since usually VLC has no specific spectrum mask, the out-of-band components generated by clipping can be remained. Thus, there is no need to care peak regrowth which is a typical problem of Clipping And Filtering method (CAF).

In a normal MIMO-OFDM system, symbol detection is carried out over the signals received by multiple antenna elements and is separated from decoding. However, owing to form factor limitation, a mobile terminal may have a limited number of receive antenna elements. Instead of splitting detection and decoding, in this paper, a joint maximum likelihood (ML) decoding in an overloaded MIMO-OFDM system is investigated. Based on ideal interleaving, independence among coded symbols spread over subcarriers is assumed. Thus, the outage capacity improves even though the ergodic capacity remains the same with a single receive antenna. As an example of the proposed system, bit error rate performance of Hamming coded and spatially multiplexed signals with joint ML decoding on a Rayleigh fading channel is investigated. The error rate is evaluated through analysis and computer simulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691895/6704511/06704654.pdf","startPage":"775","endPage":"780","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704654","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of joint maximum-likelihood decoding for block coded signal streams in overloaded MIMO-OFDM system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Receiving antennas","Joints","Encoding","Noise","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","error statistics","Hamming codes","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels","receiving antennas","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum-likelihood decoding","block coded signal streams","overloaded MIMO-OFDM system","multiple-input multiple-output system","symbol detection","mobile terminal","factor limitation","multiple antenna elements","outage capacity","ergodic capacity","single receive antenna","bit error rate performance","BER performance","Hamming coded signals","spatially multiplexed signals","joint ML decoding","Rayleigh fading channel","computer simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance of joint maximum-likelihood decoding for block coded signal streams in overloaded MIMO-OFDM system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704654/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027079","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of joint maximum-likelihood decoding for block coded signal streams in overloaded MIMO-OFDM system","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"148FM2E2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08633S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691895","isNumber":"6704511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691895","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"6704511","articleId":"6704654","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6704655,"authors":[{"name":"Masashi Fushiki","affiliation":["KDDI R&D Laboratories Inc., Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Masashi","lastName":"Fushiki","id":"37399068400"},{"name":"Yosuke Akimoto","affiliation":["KDDI R&D Laboratories Inc., Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yosuke","lastName":"Akimoto","id":"38242346000"},{"name":"Satoshi Konishi","affiliation":["KDDI R&D Laboratories Inc., Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Konishi","id":"37266090500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6361-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6360-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704655","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis on the effect of transmission power applied to small cells in LTE-advanced downlink","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704655","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Interference","Degradation","Base stations","Long Term Evolution","Downlink","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference","Long Term Evolution","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE-advanced downlink","huge mobile data traffic","3GPP","3rd Generation Partnership Project","small base stations","macro base stations","spectral efficiency","inter-cell interference","small cell transmission power","cell-edge user","co-channel scenario","traffic offloading technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE-Advanced downlink","Small Cell","Co-channel Scenario","Dedicated Channel Scenario","Transmit power optimization"]}],"abstract":"In order to cope with huge mobile data traffic, 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) has started to discuss the architecture and optimization of a network that introduces a large amount of small base stations (small cells) with higher frequency bands into the area covered by macro base stations (macro cells) with lower frequency bands. In such a network, spectral efficiency will be degraded because of the inter-cell interference among small cells. Therefore, it is important to clarify how much the transmission power of small cells is required to decrease inter-cell interference. This paper presents throughput performances as a function of small cell transmission power for two deployment scenarios. The first is the \u201cco-channel scenario,\u201d where the same frequency bands are shared by both macro and small cells. The other is the \u201cdedicated channel scenario,\u201d where the frequency band of macro cells is different from that of small cells. The numerical results showed that especially the cell-edge user throughput decreases significantly as the transmission power of small cells decreases. In addition, the co-channel scenario outperforms the dedicated channel scenario regardless of the transmission power of small cells, however, higher cell-edge user throughput can be achieved in the dedicated channel scenario compared to that in the co-channel scenario when the traffic offloading technique is introduced.","doi":"10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704655","publicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691895/6704511/06704655.pdf","startPage":"781","endPage":"786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPACS.2013.6704655","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Analysis on the effect of transmission power applied to small cells in LTE-advanced downlink","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704655/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704655/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis on the effect of transmission power applied to small cells in LTE-advanced downlink","confLoc":"Naha, Japan","sourcePdf":"149FM2E3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05801S","chronDate":"12-15 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691895","isNumber":"6704511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691895","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6704511","articleId":"6704655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6704658,"authors":[{"name":"Shohei Inoshita","affiliation":["Dept. of Communications Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Shohei","lastName":"Inoshita","id":"37085447731"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Miyazaki","affiliation":["Dept. of Communications Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Miyazaki","id":"38557777600"},{"name":"Fumiyuki Adachi","affiliation":["Dept. of Communications Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiyuki","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37280708600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6361-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6360-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704658","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"abstract":"Antenna diversity is a powerful technique to mitigate the impact of multipath fading. In a conventional centralized antenna network (CAN), diversity antennas are co-located at base station and hence, the impacts of the propagation path loss and the shadowing loss cannot be mitigated. Distributed antenna network (DAN) is an effective way to mitigate all of the above impacts. The choice of the multi-access technique is a very important issue. In this paper, we consider broadband DS-CDMA with joint minimum mean square error based frequency domain-equalization (MMSE-FDE)/antenna diversity as the multi-access technique for DAN and investigate the link capacity and required transmit power to compare with CAN. It is shown by the computer simulation that DS-CDMA DAN can reduce the required transmit power for the given bit error rate (BER) and can obtain larger uplink cellular capacity than DS-CDMA CAN.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Symposium on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communication

tremendous cost implications. While numerous mechanisms have been proposed to cap power consumption, real datacenter power consumption data is scarce. Prior studies have either used a small set of applications and/or servers, or presented data that is at an aggregate scale from which it is difficult to design and evaluate new and existing optimizations. To address this gap, we collect power measurement data at multiple spatial and fine-grained temporal resolutions from several geo-distributed datacenters of Microsoft corporation over 6 months. We conduct aggregate analysis of this data to study its statistical properties. We find evidence of self-similarity in power demands, statistical multiplexing effects, and correlations with the cooling power that caters to the IT equipment. With workload characterization a key ingredient for systems design and evaluation, we note the importance of better abstractions for capturing power demands, in the form of peaks and valleys. We identify attributes for peaks and valleys, and important correlations across these attributes that can influence the choice and effectiveness of different power capping techniques. We characterize these attributes and their correlations, showing the burstiness of small duration peaks, and the importance of not ignoring the rare but more stringent or long peaks. The correlations between peaks and valleys suggest the need for techniques to aggregate and collectively handle them. With the wide scope of exploitability of such characteristics for power provisioning and optimizations, we illustrate its benefits with two specific case studies. The first shows how peaks can be differentially handled based on our peak and valley characterization using existing approaches, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. The second illustrates a simple capacity provisioning strategy for energy storage using the peak and valley characteristics.","doi":"10.1109/IISWC.2013.6704669","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689493/6704662/06704669.pdf","startPage":"44","endPage":"55","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IISWC.2013.6704669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704662","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ACE: Abstracting, characterizing and exploiting datacenter power demands","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704669/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"ACE: Abstracting, characterizing and exploiting datacenter power demands","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14025993","htmlLink":"/document/6704669/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ACE: Abstracting, characterizing and exploiting datacenter power demands","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"005Wang19final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072259S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689493","isNumber":"6704662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689493","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6704662","articleId":"6704669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6704670,"authors":[{"name":"Gokcen Kestor","affiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"],"firstName":"Gokcen","lastName":"Kestor","id":"38233220000"},{"name":"Roberto Gioiosa","affiliation":["Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Gioiosa","id":"37424256600"},{"name":"Darren J.

This problem is compounded when many permutations of system design parameters and workloads are tested to investigate system sensitivities and full-system effects with confidence. In this paper, we propose a methodology to tractably explore the processor design space and to characterize applications in a full-system simulation environment. We combine SimPoint, Principal Component Analysis and Fractional Factorial experimental designs to substantially reduce the simulation effort needed to characterize and analyze workloads. We also present a non-invasive user-interface automation tool to allow us to study all types of workloads in a simulation environment.

growth in the number of mobile devices and the higher data rate requirements of mobile subscribers have made wireless signal processing a key driving application of mobile computing technology. To design better mobile platforms and the supporting wireless infrastructure, it is very important for computer architects and system designers to understand and characterize the performance of existing and upcoming wireless protocols. In this paper, we present a newly developed open-source benchmark suite called WiBench. It consists of a wide range of signal processing kernels used in many mainstream standards such as 802.11, WCDMA and LTE. The kernels include FFT/IFFT, MIMO, channel estimation, channel coding, constellation mapping, etc. Each kernel is a self-contained configurable block which can be tuned to meet the different system requirements. Several standard channel models have also been included to study system performance, such as the bit error rate. The suite also contains an LTE uplink system as a representative example of a wireless system that can be built using these kernels. WiBench is provided in C++ to make it easier for computer architects to profile and analyze the system. We characterize the performance of WiBench to illustrate how it can be used to guide hardware system design. Architectural analyses on each individual kernel and on the entire LTE uplink are performed, indicating the hotspots, available parallelism, and runtime performance. Finally, a MATLAB version is also included for debugging purposes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14025994","htmlLink":"/document/6704678/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"WiBench: An open source kernel suite for benchmarking wireless systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WiBench: An open source kernel suite for benchmarking wireless systems","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"014Zheng2final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074049S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689493","isNumber":"6704662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689493","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6704662","articleId":"6704678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6704682,"authors":[{"name":"Brian Delgado","affiliation":["Portland State University"],"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Delgado","id":"37086757566"},{"name":"Karen L.

Previously, it has been assumed that time spent in SMM would be relatively small and therefore its side effects on privileged software were unimportant; recently, researchers have proposed uses, such as security-related checks, that would greatly increase the amount of runtime spent in this mode. We present the results of a detailed performance study to characterize the performance impacts of SMM, using measurement infrastructure we have developed. Our study includes impact to application, system, and hypervisor. We show there can be clear negative effects from prolonged preemptions. However, if SMM duration is kept within certain ranges, perturbation caused by SMIs may be kept to a minimum.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704682/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704682/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14025983","conferenceDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance implications of System Management Mode","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance implications of System Management Mode","confLoc":"Portland, OR, USA","sourcePdf":"018delgado76final.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061441S","chronDate":"22-24 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689493","isNumber":"6704662","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689493","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6704662","articleId":"6704682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6704691,"authors":[{"name":"K.

In this paper, the authors propose various gate-level architectures for LOD and LOPD. The LOD and LOPD circuits are evolved using the evolutionary algorithm (EA) and using the evolved lower-order gate structures, various higher-order circuits are constructed. To obtain better results, the EA is modified and a novel shuffling operation is performed to prevent the algorithm from settling in the local minima. Then the constructed LOD and LOPD circuit is synthesized using Cadence\u00ae RTLCompiler\u00ae using TSMC 180nm library. The LOD and LOPD circuits can be implemented in an Application Specific Integrated circuit (ASIC) or in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and hence it is independent of the technology library. Perhaps the evolution can also be made as an intrinsic process during the application run time and the evolved best gate structure can be chosen. We restrict this paper to the extrinsic evolution of LOD and LOPD gate level architectures.","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2013.6704691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2013.6704691","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9754/6704686/06704691.pdf","startPage":"103","endPage":"110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leading one detectors and leading one position detectors - An evolutionary design methodology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704691/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer  2013","displayDocTitle":"Leading one detectors and leading one position detectors - An evolutionary design methodology","volume":"36","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Summer 2013","accessionNumber":"13998736","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704691/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leading one detectors and leading one position detectors - An evolutionary design methodology","sourcePdf":"CJECE36N3KunarajSeshasayanan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092434S","chronDate":"Summer  2013","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"6704686","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6704686","articleId":"6704691","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6704714,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Y.

While adaptive processing is primarily employed for only receive beamforming in conventional design, we propose a fully adaptive approach involving jointly selecting the transmit correlation matrix and receive beamformer by maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The motivation of utilizing adaptive processing at the transmitter is that with imprecise knowledge of the interference (e.g., due to limited training data), only relying on adaptive receive beamforming may be inadequate for effective interference cancellation, whereas joint adaptive transmit and receive beamforming can afford a stronger ability to handle the interference.

The FLC proposed presents that the convergent distribution of the membership function offers faster response than the symmetrically distributed membership functions. The fuzzy controller for the SEPIC MPPT scheme shows high precision in current transition and keeps the voltage without any changes, in the variable-load case, represented in small steady-state error and small overshoot. The proposed scheme ensures optimal use of PV array and proves its efficacy in variable load conditions, unity, and lagging power factor at the inverter output (load) side. The real-time implementation of the MPPT SEPIC converter is done by a digital signal processor (DSP), i.e., TMS320F28335. The performance of the converter is tested in both simulation and experiment at different operating conditions. The performance of the proposed FLC-based MPPT operation of SEPIC converter is compared to that of the conventional proportional-integral (PI)-based SEPIC converter. The results show that the proposed FLC-based MPPT scheme for SEPIC can accurately track the reference signal and transfer power around 4.8% more than the conventional PI-based system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","volume":"50","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"14450680","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6704722/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy-Logic-Controller-Based SEPIC Converter for Maximum Power Point Tracking","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"University of Malaya's High Impact Research","grantNumber":"HIRD000032"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy-Logic-Controller-Based SEPIC Converter for Maximum Power Point Tracking","sourcePdf":"tia-elkhateb-2298558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105622S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"6855381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"185","xplore-issue":"6855381","articleId":"6704722","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":6704725,"authors":[{"name":"Yves Gendrault","affiliation":["de l\u2019Informatique et de l\u2019Imagerie, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg and the Centre National de Recherches Scientifiques, Strasbourg, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/6774470/6704725/6704725-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yves Gendrault was born in Strasbourg, France, in 1986.

Each day, progresses are made to improve the complexity of artificial biological functions in order to tend to complex biodevices and biosystems. Up to now, these systems are handmade by bioengineers, which require strong technical skills and leads to nonreusable development. Besides, scientific fields that share the same design approach, such as microelectronics, have already overcome several issues and designers succeed in building extremely complex systems with many evolved functions. On the other hand, in systems engineering and more specifically in microelectronics, the development of the domain has been promoted by both the improvement of technological processes and electronic design automation tools. The work presented in this paper paves the way for the adaptation of microelectronics design tools to synthetic biology. Considering the similarities and differences between the synthetic biology and microelectronics, the milestones of this adaptation are described. The first one concerns the modeling of biological mechanisms. To do so, a new formalism is proposed, based on an extension of the generalized Kirchhoff laws to biology. This way, a description of all biological mechanisms can be made with languages widely used in microelectronics. Our approach is therefore successfully validated on specific examples drawn from the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2014.2298559","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/6774470/06704725.pdf","startPage":"1231","endPage":"1240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2014.2298559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6774470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Biology With HDL Languages: A First Step Toward a Genetic Design Automation Tool Inspired From Microelectronics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Biology With HDL Languages: A First Step Toward a Genetic Design Automation Tool Inspired From Microelectronics","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6704725/","accessionNumber":"14180243","pubMedId":"24658247","volume":"61","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Biology With HDL Languages: A First Step Toward a Genetic Design Automation Tool Inspired From Microelectronics","sourcePdf":"tbme-madec-2298559-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125651S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6774470","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6774470","articleId":"6704725","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6704733,"authors":[{"name":"Xueshi Li","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xueshi","lastName":"Li","id":"37085738878"},{"name":"Mengdao Xing","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Mengdao","lastName":"Xing","id":"37300837500"},{"name":"Xiang-Gen Xia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang-Gen","lastName":"Xia","id":"37274950700"},{"name":"Guang-Cai Sun","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Guang-Cai","lastName":"Sun","id":"37596858300"},{"name":"Yi Liang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Liang","id":"37534043900"},{"name":"Zheng Bao","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Bao","id":"37274384700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"6704733","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":557},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a novel deramp space-time adaptive processing (Deramp-STAP) method for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems to achieve effective clutter suppression.

Furthermore, in the case of signal undersampling, the ambiguously focused position in azimuth for a moving target can be avoided by the proposed method. Moreover, the computational complexity can be drastically reduced because we only need to consider the baseband velocity of the moving target; here, the range of the baseband velocity is much smaller than that of the real target velocity, for clutter suppression in this method.

To process them with binary or multiclass classifiers, methods for transforming multilabel data sets (MLDs) have been proposed, as well as adapted algorithms able to work with this type of data sets. However, until now, few studies have addressed the problem of how to deal with MLDs having a large number of labels. This characteristic can be defined as high dimensionality in the label space (output attributes), in contrast to the traditional high dimensionality problem, which is usually focused on the feature space (by means of feature selection) or sample space (by means of instance selection). The purpose of this paper is to analyze dimensionality in the label space in MLDs, and to present a transformation methodology based on the use of association rules to discover label dependencies. These dependencies are used to reduce the label space, to ease the work of any MLC algorithm, and to infer the deleted labels in a final postprocessing stage. The proposed process is validated in an extensive experimentation with several MLDs and classification algorithms, resulting in a statistically significant improvement of performance in some cases, as will be shown.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LI-MLC: A Label Inference Methodology for Addressing High Dimensionality in the Label Space for Multilabel Classification","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2296501","startPage":"1842","endPage":"1854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2296501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6914636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6914636/06704769.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"LI-MLC: A Label Inference Methodology for Addressing High Dimensionality in the Label Space for Multilabel Classification","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6704769/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14633767","pubMedId":"25291737","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Education through the F.P.U.

The electrical conductivity of these nanomaterial-based polymeric electrodes and the DEP-assembled sensor is analyzed before, during, and after exposure to ethanol.

In this paper, in order to increase its imaging speed, we consider the use of a sinusoidal scanning method, i.e., a spiral scanning method with an improved model predictive control (MPC) scheme. In this approach, spirals are generated by applying waves, each with a single frequency and slowly varying amplitude, in the X-piezo (sine wave) and Y-piezo (cosine wave) of the piezoelectric tube scanner (PTS) of the AFM. As these input signals are single frequencies, the scanning can proceed faster than traditional raster scanning, without exciting the resonant mode of the PTS. The proposed MPC controller reduces the phase error between the reference position input and measured output sinusoids and provides better tracking of the reference signal. Also, a notch filter is designed and included in the feedback loop to suppress vibrations of the PTS at the resonant frequency. The experimental results show that, using the proposed method, the AFM is able to scan a 6 \u03bcm radius image within 2.04 s with a quality better than that obtained using the conventional raster pattern scanning method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"03 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14633680","htmlLink":"/document/6704816/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of Sinusoidal Scanning With MPC in AFM Imaging","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of Sinusoidal Scanning With MPC in AFM Imaging","sourcePdf":"tmech-rana-2295112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08463S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6915929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6915929","articleId":"6704816","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6704824,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6732988/6704824/6704824-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuan Wang received the B.S.

High-dimensional measurements are converted into low-dimensional representations through linear compression. Our aim is to compress a noisy sensor measurement, allowing for the fact that the compressed measurement will then be transmitted over a noisy channel. We give the closed-form expression for the optimal compression matrix that minimizes the trace or determinant of the error covariance matrix. We show that the solutions share a common architecture consisting of a canonical coordinate transformation, scaling by coefficients which account for canonical correlations and channel noise variance, followed by a coordinate transformation into the sub-dominant invariant subspace of the channel noise. Furthermore, we explore the design problem with respect to more general criteria and provide a unified factorization for the corresponding optimal compression matrix. A necessary condition is obtained for the optimal compression.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2298374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2298374","startPage":"1279","endPage":"1289","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6732988/06704824.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6732988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimum Compression of a Noisy Measurement for Transmission Over a Noisy Channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Compression of a Noisy Measurement for Transmission Over a Noisy Channel","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March1, 2014","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2014","volume":"62","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6704824/","accessionNumber":"14094246","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704824/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Compression of a Noisy Measurement for Transmission Over a Noisy Channel","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2298374-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073865S","chronDate":"March1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6732988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6732988","articleId":"6704824","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6704826,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Xiong","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Technology, the State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37408672000"},{"name":"Pingyi Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pingyi","lastName":"Fan","id":"37277801500"},{"name":"Zhengfeng Xu","affiliation":["Shanghai Telecommunications Technologies Research Institute of China Telecom, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhengfeng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37956804000"},{"name":"Hong-Chuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Canada"],"firstName":"Hong-Chuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37278138800"},{"name":"Khaled Ben Letaief","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science & Technology (HKUST)"],"firstName":"Khaled Ben","lastName":"Letaief","id":"37273525100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6704826","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":970},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Array signal processing","MIMO","Antennas","Vectors","Educational institutions","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","array signal processing","decode and forward communication","MIMO communication","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal cooperative beamforming design","MIMO DF relay channels","transmit beamforming design","multiple-input-multiple-output decode-and-forward half-duplex two-hop relay channels","direct source-destination link","single antenna","mathematical derivation","low-complexity explicit expression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","relay","decode and forward","transmit beamforming and optimization"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider a transmit beamforming design for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) decode-and-forward (DF) half-duplex two-hop relay channels with a direct source-destination link.

However, in such networks, huge overhead is required to obtain full CSI especially for Frequency-Division Duplex (FDD) systems. To reduce overhead, we propose a downlink antenna selection scheme, which selects S antennas from M > S transmit antennas based on the large scale fading to serve K \u2264 S users in large distributed MIMO networks employing regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding. In particular, we study the joint optimization of antenna selection, regularization factor, and power allocation to maximize the average weighted sum-rate. This is a mixed combinatorial and non-convex problem whose objective and constraints have no closed-form expressions. We apply random matrix theory to derive asymptotically accurate expressions for the objective and constraints. As such, the joint optimization problem is decomposed into subproblems, each of which is solved by an efficient algorithm. In addition, we derive structural solutions for some special cases and show that the capacity of very large distributed MIMO networks scales as O(KlogM) when M\u2192\u221e with K, S fixed. Simulations show that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gain over various baselines.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6732988/06704827.pdf","startPage":"1319","endPage":"1328","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2298367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2298367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6732988","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Power and Antenna Selection Optimization in Large Cloud Radio Access Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Fading","Antenna arrays","Transmitting antennas","Optimization","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","fading","frequency division multiplexing","MIMO communication","precoding","radio access networks","radio transmitters","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint power and antenna selection optimization","large cloud radio access networks","multiple-input multiple-output networks","distributed MIMO networks","channel state information","frequency-division duplex systems","FDD","transmit antennas","regularized zero-forcing precoding","regularization factor","power allocation","nonconvex problem","random matrix theory","performance gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Large MIMO","cloud radio access networks","antenna selection","asymptotic analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704827/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Joint Power and Antenna Selection Optimization in Large Cloud Radio Access Networks","volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6704827/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14094248","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Power and Antenna Selection Optimization in Large Cloud Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-liu-2298367-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082807S","chronDate":"March1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6732988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"6732988","articleId":"6704827","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6704828,"authors":[{"name":"Hamad Alrimeih","affiliation":["King Abdul-Aziz City for Science and Technology, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6963544/6704828/alrim-2294649-small.gif","p":["Hamad Alrimeih received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada, in 2012.","He is currently a Research Scientist with the King Abdul-Aziz City for Science and Technology, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Past measurement studies have identified issues with today's commercial players when multiple bit-rate-adaptive players share a bottleneck link with respect to three metrics: fairness, efficiency, and stability. Unfortunately, our current understanding of why these effects occur and how they can be mitigated is quite limited. In this paper, we present a principled understanding of bit-rate adaptation and analyze several commercial players through the lens of an abstract player model consisting of three main components: bandwidth estimation, bit-rate selection, and chunk scheduling. Using framework, we identify the root causes of several undesirable interactions that arise as a consequence of overlaying the video bit-rate adaptation over HTTP. Building on these insights, we develop a suite of techniques that can systematically guide the tradeoffs between stability, fairness, and efficiency and thus lead to a general framework for robust video adaptation. We pick one concrete instance from this design space and show that it significantly outperforms today's commercial players on all three key metrics across a range of experimental scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2013.2291681","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/6739138/06704839.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2013.2291681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6739138","startPage":"326","endPage":"340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Fairness, Efficiency, and Stability in HTTP-Based Adaptive Video Streaming With Festive","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improving Fairness, Efficiency, and Stability in HTTP-Based Adaptive Video Streaming With Festive","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704839/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14111398","dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6704839/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Fairness, Efficiency, and Stability in HTTP-Based Adaptive Video Streaming With Festive","sourcePdf":"tnet-sekar-2291681-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127843S","chronDate":"Feb.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6739138","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"199","xplore-issue":"6739138","articleId":"6704839","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":6704841,"authors":[{"name":"Gilberto Oliveira Corr\u00eaa","affiliation":["Laborat\u00f3rio Nacional de Computa\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica-LNCC/MCTI, Petr\u00f3polis, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil-CEP"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6744712/6704841/6704841-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gilberto Oliveira Corr\u00eaa was born in Alegre, ES, Brazil in 1953.

To accelerate tag identification, some researchers have recently adopted bit tracking technology that allows the reader to detect the locations of collided bits in a collision slot. However, these methods still encounter the problem of too many collisions occurring at the beginning of identification. This paper proposes an optimal binary tracking tree protocol (OBTT) that tries to separate all of the tags into smaller sets to reduce collisions at the beginning of identification. Using bit tracking technology, OBTT mainly adopts three proposed approaches, bit estimation, optimal partition, and binary tracking tree. Bit estimation first estimates the number of tags based on the locations of collided bits. Optimal partition then determines the optimal number of the initial sets based on this estimation. Binary tracking tree lets the tag utilize one counter to achieve the split during the identification process. This paper formally analyzes the slot efficiency of OBTT, which represents how many tags can be identified in a slot. Results show that the slot efficiency is close to 0.614, the highest value published to date. Considering slot lengths, OBTT further determines the optimal number of the initial sets to minimize the identification delay. The analytical results show that the delay efficiency of OBTT achieves 0.750, where delay efficiency represents the number of tags that can be identified in a baseline slot, the length of which is the complete ID sent by the tag. The simulation results show that OBTT outperforms other existing algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2013.2295839","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7041254/06704842.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2013.2295839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7041254","startPage":"255","endPage":"268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Slot Assignment for Binary Tracking Tree Protocol in RFID Tag Identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704842","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Slot Assignment for Binary Tracking Tree Protocol in RFID Tag Identification","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704842/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14930746","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6704842/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Slot Assignment for Binary Tracking Tree Protocol in RFID Tag Identification","sourcePdf":"tnet-hsiao-2295839-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092838S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7041254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7041254","articleId":"6704842","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6704843,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6mer G\u00f6ksu","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/6835113/6704843/6704843-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\u00d6mer G\u00f6ksu (s'07) was born in Izmir, Turkey, in 1982.

We compare two distinct protocols: 1) TAS with receiver maximal-ratio combining (TAS/MRC) and 2) TAS with receiver selection combining (TAS/SC). For each protocol, we derive new closed-form expressions for the exact and asymptotic outage probability with independent Nakagami-m fading in the primary and secondary networks. Our results are valid for two scenarios related to the maximum SU transmit power, i.e., P, and the peak PU interference temperature, i.e., Q. When P is proportional to Q, our results confirm that TAS/MRC and TAS/SC relaying achieve the same full diversity gain. As such, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) advantage of TAS/MRC relaying relative to TAS/SC relaying is characterized as a simple ratio of their respective SNR gains. When P is independent of Q, we find that an outage floor is obtained in the large P regime where the SU transmit power is constrained by a fixed value of Q. This outage floor is accurately characterized by our exact and asymptotic results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6895341/06704874.pdf","startPage":"3250","endPage":"3262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2298387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2298387","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6895341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmit Antenna Selection for Interference Management in Cognitive Relay Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Transmitting antennas","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Receiving antennas","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","decode and forward communication","diversity reception","Nakagami channels","protocols","radiofrequency interference","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit antenna selection","maximal ratio combining","TAS-MRC relaying","receiver selection combining","TAS-SC relaying","interference management","cognitive relay networks","decode and forward relaying","underlay spectrum sharing networks","Nakagami-m fading"]},{"kwd":["Cognitive radio","relays","spectrum sharing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Transmit Antenna Selection for Interference Management in Cognitive Relay Networks","volume":"63","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/6704874/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14581687","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmit Antenna Selection for Interference Management in Cognitive Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-yeoh-2298387-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090609S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6895341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6895341","articleId":"6704874","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6704920,"authors":[{"name":"Dusan B.

The comparison shows close matching of the results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 11th International Conference on Telecommunications in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Services (TELSIKS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6683940/6704880/06704921.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"220","publicationTitle":"2013 11th International Conference on Telecommunications in Modern Satellite, Cable and Broadcasting Services (TELSIKS)","doi":"10.1109/TELSKS.2013.6704921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TELSKS.2013.6704921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704880","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6704921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage probability approximations for dual-hop amplify-and-forward MIMO relay systems in rayleigh fading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Erbium","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","MIMO communication","probability","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage probability","dual hop MIMO relay","amplify and forward MIMO relay","Rayleigh fading","signal-to-noise ratio","channel state information","multiple antenna","space-time block coding transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6704921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Outage probability approximations for dual-hop amplify-and-forward MIMO relay systems in rayleigh fading","isConference":true,"volume":"01","htmlLink":"/document/6704921/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14025016","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"16-19 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage probability approximations for dual-hop amplify-and-forward MIMO relay systems in rayleigh fading","confLoc":"Nis, Serbia","sourcePdf":"WCI3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044098S","chronDate":"16-19 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6683940","isNumber":"6704880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6683940","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6704880","articleId":"6704921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6704922,"authors":[{"name":"Slavche Pejoski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies, University Cyril and Methodius, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia"],"firstName":"Slavche","lastName":"Pejoski","id":"37597822100"},{"name":"Venceslav Kafedziski","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies, University Cyril and Methodius, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia"],"firstName":"Venceslav","lastName":"Kafedziski","id":"37326524800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0902-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0899-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0900-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6704922","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Streaming media","MIMO","Video coding","Wireless communication","Encoding","Signal to noise ratio","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","MIMO communication","probability","Rayleigh channels","source coding","telecommunication network reliability","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint source channel coding","real time H.264/AVC video transmission","wireless MIMO channel","outage probability","central controller","video quality","probability density function","mutual information","video encoder adaptation","total distortion minimization","Rayleigh fading channel","channel distribution information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Joint source channel coding","H.264/AVC","Rate distortion model","Wireless MIMO channel","Outage probability"]}],"abstract":"We propose a joint source channel coding framework for real time transmission of H.264/AVC single layer video signals over wireless MIMO channels.

The MIMO channel is characterized by the probability density function of its mutual information and the performance of the H.264/AVC encoder is modeled by a rate distortion model that takes into account the channel errors. The framework allows for the video encoder adaptation, given the current video frame, to minimize the total distortion taking into account the available system resources and channel statistics.

A precise compensation of the range-dependent components of the motion error is indispensable for high-resolution SAR systems. Besides, the MoCom has to be compatible with an accurate focusing technique - the Omega-K algorithm in this case. After a proper bulk MoCom and a range cell migration correction, the proposed MoCom accomplishes a phase error compensation considered for every position in the spot. For pulsed SAR with a squint angle of 20\u00b0 and a depression angle of 20\u00b0, the proposed algorithm compensates residual phase errors greater than [-\u03c0, +\u03c0] radian and obtains significant image quality enhancement. The distinctive feature of the proposed approach is its capability to compensate residual motion errors in the presence of a large squint angle.","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings of 2013 Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings of 2013 Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6690576/6704984/06705049.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704984","startPage":"202","endPage":"205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Second order motion compensation for squinted spotlight synthetic aperture radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Second order motion compensation for squinted spotlight synthetic aperture radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705049/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026659","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6705049/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Second order motion compensation for squinted spotlight synthetic aperture radar","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"p2206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043553S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690576","isNumber":"6704984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690576","xplore-issue":"6704984","articleId":"6705049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6705097,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Xiao","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, Beijing China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Xiao"},{"name":"Ze Yu","affiliation":["Beihang University, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Ze","lastName":"Yu"},{"name":"Chunsheng Li","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, Beijing China"],"firstName":"Chunsheng","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, BeiHang University, Beijing China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-88552-278-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6705097","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synthetic aperture radar","Compressed sensing","Image resolution","Signal resolution","Imaging","Bandwidth","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","geophysical signal processing","radar signal processing","remote sensing by radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","2D SAR imaging","synthetic aperture radar","SAR systems","compressive sensing","sparse signal detection","sparse signal allocation","sidelobe suppression","azimuth ambiguity elimination","super resolution imaging"]}],"abstract":"Modern Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems operate with high bandwidths to achieve high resolution. But huge amount of data caused by high resolution and large swath can easily exceed the storage capacity and the transmittal bandwidth. Compressive Sensing (CS) techniques offer a framework for the detection and allocation of sparse signal with a reduced number of measurements. Under the framework of Compressive Sensing, sampling rate is not related to the effective bandwidth of signal, but determined by the content and structure of the interested information. Combining CS with SAR can settle the restraint relationship between the data quantity and resolution. Even better, for CS algorithm is a signal estimation method, CS-SAR may solve some problems which are brought by match filter method, such as sidelobe suppression, azimuth ambiguity elimination and super-resolution imaging.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On compressed sensing applied to 2-D SAR imaging","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings of 2013 Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings of 2013 Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6690576/6704984/06705097.pdf","startPage":"388","endPage":"391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704984","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705097/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"On compressed sensing applied to 2-D SAR imaging","conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6705097/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026580","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On compressed sensing applied to 2-D SAR imaging","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"p2429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056318S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690576","isNumber":"6704984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690576","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6704984","articleId":"6705097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6705109,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, P.R.

Moreover, higher resolution can be obtained by exploiting the sparsity of the target based on compressed sensing (CS) theory. However, traditional CS-based imaging methods would be severely affected when off-grid scatterers exist. To overcome the problem stated above, this paper proposes a sparse imaging method to deal with off-grid target in FD-MIMO radar using improved orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) technique both in the range and angle dimension. Firstly, the off-grid simultaneous OMP (OG-SOMP) method is proposed for range compression, then for angle compression, the off-grid OMP (OG-OMP) method is implemented to each non-zero range profile. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance improvement of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse imaging using improved OMP technique in FD-MIMO radar for target off the grid","publicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings of 2013 Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Proceedings of 2013 Asia-Pacific Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (APSAR)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6690576/6704984/06705109.pdf","startPage":"434","endPage":"437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704984","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Sparse imaging using improved OMP technique in FD-MIMO radar for target off the grid","conferenceDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6705109/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026520","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse imaging using improved OMP technique in FD-MIMO radar for target off the grid","confLoc":"Tsukuba, Japan","sourcePdf":"p2441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06S","chronDate":"23-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690576","isNumber":"6704984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690576","xplore-issue":"6704984","articleId":"6705109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEICE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6705133,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Although it offers tremendous opportunities, there are some major challenges, such as security, that must be solved for efficient usage. Confidentiality is one of the most important points of information security especially in financial, governmental and military usage. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for cloud computing to protect cloud users from the untrusted cloud providers and untrusted employees. The proposed approach is built as an improvement on an existing model, which is called AdjointVM. In this model, it is aimed to overcome one of the weakest points of AdjointVM model, the defenselessness of the protection architecture, and to build a more secure cloud environment for users. In AdjointVM, to protect the VM, there have to be two configured VMs: the protected VM and the protector VM. These VMs are connected in a circular chain to monitor intrusions. Unlike AdjointVM, in which the number of running VMs is proportional to the number of VMs that have to be protected, in the proposed model, this number remains the same, and this results in a decrease in the capital expenditure (capex).","doi":"10.1109/CINTI.2013.6705192","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 14th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 14th International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Informatics (CINTI)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6700566/6705159/06705192.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CINTI.2013.6705192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705159","startPage":"201","endPage":"206","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A circular chain intrusion detection for cloud computing based on improved AdjointVM approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705192","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A circular chain intrusion detection for cloud computing based on improved AdjointVM approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705192/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14030106","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6705192/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A circular chain intrusion detection for cloud computing based on improved AdjointVM approach","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"35cinti2013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067973S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6700566","isNumber":"6705159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6700566","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6705159","articleId":"6705192","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6705204,"authors":[{"name":"Akos Nagy","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Akos","lastName":"Nagy","id":"37085405682"},{"name":"Bence Kovari","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"Bence","lastName":"Kovari","id":"37657928700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0197-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0194-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6705204","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Analytical models","Pricing","Data transfer"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","pricing","software performance evaluation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing environments","IT related enterprise needs","generalized provider-neutral service","cost model","mathematical optimization algorithms","performance evaluation","virtual machines","VM"]}],"abstract":"The emerging technology of cloud computing offers off-premise, reliable solutions for common IT related needs of enterprises, but as different providers often envision these solutions in a different way, architects face a complex problem when trying to decide which provider to choose and compare or estimate the costs of different options.

The number of solutions for VRP increases exponentially while the number of points, which must be visited increases.

Some approaches like evolutionary algorithms allow finding feasible solutions in an acceptable time. However, if the number of visiting points increases, these algorithms require high performance computing, and they remain insufficient for finding a feasible solution quickly. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have tremendous computational power by allowing parallel processing over lots of computing grids, and they can lead to significant performance gains compared with typical CPU implementations. In this paper, it is aimed to present efficient implementation of Genetic Algorithm, which is an evolutionary algorithm that is inspired by processes observed in the biological evolution of living organisms to find approximate solutions for optimization problems such as Traveling Salesman Problem, on GPU. A 1-Thread in 1-Position (1T1P) approach is developed to improve the performance through maximizing efficiency, which then yielded a significant acceleration by using GPUs.

As a newer biologic update rule to hebbian learning, spiking-time dependent plasticity (STDP) concerns on the temporal order of presynaptic spike and postsynaptic spike which will change the strength of, the connection site of neurons, synapse. In this paper a different way is shown to utilise the novel element memristors to implement a supervised STDP. Because the resistance of memristor depends on its past states, researchers are particularly interested in using such functionality to mimic synaptic connection. Furthermore, benefit from the nano size of memristors and its crossbar structure, large scale neural networks could be implemented. In this supervised STDP, each spike arrival will be assumed to leave a trace which decays exponentially and spikes interact under all-to-all interaction. Depending on the temporal order, memristor synapse will weaken or strengthen the connection of presynaptic neuron and postsynaptic neuron. The temporal all-to-all interaction is implemented during the simulation with training samples. We show that, by combining the memristors, a supervised STDP neural network can be built and learn from the temporal order of presynaptic spike and postsynaptic spike of the training samples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705238/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6705238/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14030094","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A supervised spiking time dependant plasticity network based on memristors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A supervised spiking time dependant plasticity network based on memristors","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"77cinti2013.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056594S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6700566","isNumber":"6705159","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6700566","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6705159","articleId":"6705238","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6705268,"authors":[{"name":"O.

This integration of EM and data-aided KF provides a robust procedure for MIMO channel estimation in fast fading wireless scenarios. Employing the random parameter approach, we prove the optimality of an iterative procedure which employs an MMSE based Kalman update of the channel estimate in the E-step followed by a fast sphere-decoder based maximum likelihood (ML) data estimate in the M-step. Thus, we demonstrate that the random parameter based KF leads to a substantial reduction in complexity compared to the deterministic parameter based approach existing in current literature. We also present a Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BRCB) analysis for the channel estimation using the random parameter KF scheme and compare it with the mean squared error (MSE) of the channel estimate. Simulation results for a fast fading MIMO wireless channel are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique with respect to bit error rate (BER) of symbol detection.","doi":"10.1109/ATNAC.2013.6705371","publicationTitle":"2013 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ATNAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ATNAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693294/6705337/06705371.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATNAC.2013.6705371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705337","startPage":"142","endPage":"147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal random parameter EM based Kalman filter (REKF) for fast fading MIMO channel estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal random parameter EM based Kalman filter (REKF) for fast fading MIMO channel estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705371/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14028125","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6705371/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal random parameter EM based Kalman filter (REKF) for fast fading MIMO channel estimation","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"1569787873.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060824S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693294","isNumber":"6705337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693294","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6705337","articleId":"6705371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6705372,"authors":[{"name":"Erwin Anggadjaja","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Erwin","lastName":"Anggadjaja","id":"37991138800"},{"name":"Ian McLoughlin","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"McLoughlin","id":"37284239200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1081-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6705372","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Payloads","Modulation","Antennas","Switches","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","antenna arrays","error statistics","MIMO communication","telecommunication switching","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer MIMO-link","packet re-routing mechanism","diverse channel condition","cross-layer adaptive modulation switching concept","TCP-enabled MIMO wireless communication systems","physically-decomposed subchannels","MIMO subchannels","time-varying error rate characteristics","simulated wireless communications system","subchannel connections","link layer","point-to-point wireless communications","channel difference","channel characteristics","data rate","bit error rate","BER","multiple antennas"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive modulation","channel difference","MIMO sub-channels","packet re-routing","switching methods"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers a cross-layer adaptive modulation switching concept for TCP-enabled MIMO wireless communication systems implementing a packet re-routing mechanism over physically decomposed sub-channels. We demonstrate that combining both adaptive modulation and packet re-routing mechanisms improve overall performance over MIMO sub-channels that posses unbalanced or uneven time-varying error rate characteristics. A simulated wireless communications system employs and evaluates packet re-routing techniques over four sub-channel connections made available to the link layer. It then considers the effect of cross-layer directed link modulation adaptation switching for point-to-point wireless communications.

M2M communications typically involves a large number of autonomous devices sending traffic in a coordinated manner (and possibly even simultaneously), therefore creating an uplink-heavy trend which needs an efficient radio resource management scheme. The conventional scheduling algorithms and performance metrics are not suitable for M2M systems because of the different characteristics and service requirements of M2M traffic. In this paper, we analyze the performance of an enhanced delay sensitive uplink scheduler in context of LTE TDD configurations 0 and 1 for delay sensitive event based M2M traffic. We show that unlike an ordinary equal capacity fair scheduler, our proposed delay sensitive scheduler can make utmost use of the maximally uplink-biased TDD configuration 0, attaining higher capacity and maximizing the chance of satisfying packet delay budget of M2M traffic. We also introduce a new performance metric called \u201cEffective Allocated Bits/RB pair\u201d to measure the allocation efficiency of a scheduler, evaluate the performance of the proposed scheduler in terms of this metric and identify the scope of possible improvements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6705373/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14028134","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of an enhanced delay sensitive LTE uplink scheduler for M2M traffic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of an enhanced delay sensitive LTE uplink scheduler for M2M traffic","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"1569792229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045897S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693294","isNumber":"6705337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693294","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6705337","articleId":"6705373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6705383,"authors":[{"name":"Yin Hui Chye","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Yin Hui","lastName":"Chye","id":"37078260700"},{"name":"Eryk Dutkiewicz","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Eryk","lastName":"Dutkiewicz","id":"38299196300"},{"name":"Rein Vesilo","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Rein","lastName":"Vesilo","id":"37388742700"},{"name":"Ren Ping Liu","affiliation":["Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Ren Ping","lastName":"Liu","id":"37534182900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1081-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6705383","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Delays","Throughput","Job shop scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","probability","quality of service","radio spectrum management","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS-aware cross-layer scheduling","cognitive radio networks","heterogeneous data traffic","secondary users","SU QoS","radio spectrum","primary users","PU performance","dynamic spectrum access","CR networks","spectrum assignment","spectrum handover","quality of service","DSA scheme","QoS satisfaction","packet scheduling","channel sharing policy","dropping probability","packet delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio network","quality of service","cross-layer design","packet scheduling","dynamic spectrum access","channel sharing","heterogeneous traffic"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-aware cross-layer scheduling for cognitive radio networks with heterogeneous data traffic","doi":"10.1109/ATNAC.2013.6705383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705337","endPage":"218","publicationTitle":"2013 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ATNAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Australasian Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ATNAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693294/6705337/06705383.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATNAC.2013.6705383","startPage":"213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705383","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) has been an enabling technology for secondary users (SUs) to efficiently exploit radio spectrum underutilized by primary users (PUs). To avoid downgrading PUs' performance, dynamic spectrum access (DSA) plays an important role in CR networks (CRNs) for adaptively assigning spectrum to SUs. During spectrum handover to PUs, quality of service (QoS) of SUs may not be satisfied due to high competition among SUs with different traffic types. However, in most existing DSA schemes, traffic types handled by SUs are treated equally. To achieve QoS satisfaction for SUs with heterogeneous traffic, this paper proposes a new cross-layer scheduling that jointly considers DSA, packet scheduling and a channel sharing policy. QoS performance of the cross-layer scheduling is measured in terms of average throughput, average packet delay and dropping probability for SUs with different traffic types. QoS support for SUs provided by the proposed scheduling scheme incorporating the channel sharing policy is shown to be more efficient and balanced compared to existing scheduling schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705383/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14028143","htmlLink":"/document/6705383/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"QoS-aware cross-layer scheduling for cognitive radio networks with heterogeneous data traffic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-aware cross-layer scheduling for cognitive radio networks with heterogeneous data traffic","confLoc":"Christchurch, New Zealand","sourcePdf":"1569798437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076821S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693294","isNumber":"6705337","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693294","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6705337","articleId":"6705383","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6705395,"authors":[{"name":"Anna Dudnikova","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, University of Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Dudnikova","id":"37085627358"},{"name":"Daniela Panno","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, University of Catania, Catania, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"Panno","id":"37329984700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0977-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6705395","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","Nickel","Signal to noise ratio","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","energy conservation","femtocellular radio","interference suppression","Long Term Evolution","power control","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy saving approach","self-optimization coverage function","LTE femtocell coverage function","macrocell area","femtocell base station approach","cochannel interference reduction","energy efficiency","signaling overhead","power control scheme","traffic demand condition","cellular network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE femtocell","dynamic adaption","self-optimization","energy efficiency","power management","offloading"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a self-optimization coverage function for LTE femtocells embedded in a macrocell area.

In a low load scenario our power control scheme limits the number of simultaneously activated femtocells, achieving a significant power saving on the entire femtocell network.

However, the development reminds challenge. Since large amount of data is accessed and the inherent delay of instruction cycle within transporting data on the DMD, it makes real-time processing of image recovery difficult. Conventionally, the pattern data was transported to DMD from PC through USB interface. Since the USB interface limited the data transfer speed, the total time of signal collection and image reconstruction was about 30 minutes. In this paper, FPGA is used to transport data from SDRAM to control the DMD, and at the same time, the signal of the photo-sensing element is acquired. As a result the control of the DMD can be improved and imaging processing time can be reduced. The development includes various components such as SDRAM interface, FIFO Data buffer, ADC interface, USB interface and DMD control interface.

However, one major drawback is the high number of data acquisition and computing requirements for this imaging technique. Due to those constraints, the TFM algorithm was earlier classified in the field of post-processing tasks. Real-time imaging is a key aspect in Non Destructive Evaluation (NDE) using ultrasound techniques. In this context, fast and precise control evaluation should be implemented on a variety of pieces. This paper describes a dedicated architecture for real-time TFM imaging using the Full Matrix Capture (FMC). In the acquisition process, data are sequentially acquired from phased arrays and temporally stored in order to be processed with synthetic focusing techniques such as the TFM algorithm. The FMC-TFM architecture consists of a set of interconnected functional blocs and integrated in an embedded system. Initially, this acoustic measurement system was dedicated to the parallel data acquisition from phased arrays. The architecture was entirely described using VHDL language, synthesized and implemented on a V5FX70T Xilinx FPGA for the control part and a V5SX95T Xilinx FPGA for the acquisition part. The maximum operating frequency is 147.3 MHz for the control part and 161.3 MHz for the acquisition part.

In this paper, we present a study on applying a model predictive control approach to the problem of efficiently optimizing microgrid operations while satisfying a time-varying request and operation constraints. The overall problem is formulated using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), which can be solved in an efficient way by using commercial solvers without resorting to complex heuristics or decompositions techniques. Then, the MILP formulation leads to significant improvements in solution quality and computational burden. A case study of a microgrid is employed to assess the performance of the online optimization-based control strategy and the simulation results are discussed. The method is applied to an experimental microgrid located in Athens, Greece. The experimental results show the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2013.2295737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2013.2295737","startPage":"1813","endPage":"1827","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/87/6863725/06705582.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6863725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model Predictive Control Approach to Microgrid Operation Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Model Predictive Control Approach to Microgrid Operation Optimization","volume":"22","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 July 2014","accessionNumber":"14469711","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6705582/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Distributed Energy Resources Research Infrastructures Project"},{"fundingName":"Sustainable-Smart Grid Open System for the Aggregated Control, Monitoring and Management of Energy Project"},{"fundingName":"European Institute of Technology Information and Communication Technology Labs"},{"fundingName":"Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model Predictive Control Approach to Microgrid Operation Optimization","sourcePdf":"tcst-parisio-2295737-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100021S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"6863725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"423","xplore-issue":"6863725","articleId":"6705582","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6705593,"authors":[{"name":"Yejun He","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yejun","lastName":"He","id":"37398856500"},{"name":"Wei He","affiliation":["Information and Communication Technology Centre, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"He","id":"38553881000"},{"name":"Hang Wong","affiliation":["Information and Communication Technology Centre, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Hang","lastName":"Wong","id":"37280423700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6705593","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":121,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7637},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"This letter introduces a wideband circularly polarized (CP) cross-dipole antenna fabricated on a double-layered printed circuit board (PCB) substrate for 2.45-GHz ISM band wireless communications. Unlike conventional cross-dipole antennas, the proposed cross dipole is designed with wide open ends such that both impedance and axial-ratio (AR) bandwidths are enhanced. In addition, to excite the CP radiation effectively, a curved-delay line providing an orthogonal phase difference among the cross-dipole elements is attached at the corners of the sequentially rotated elements. By choosing a proper radius of the curved-delay line, a wide input impedance of the antenna can be realized. The antenna is center-fed by a 50- \u03a9 coaxial cable and is placed above a square reflector to obtain a directional CP radiation pattern. With the advantage of centered feed, symmetric CP radiation patterns can be achieved across the entire operating bandwidth. Simulated and measured results confirm the proposed antenna produced good CP characteristics. An impedance bandwidth (for VSWR \u2264 2) of about 50.2% (1.99-3.22 GHz) and the 3-dB AR bandwidth of about 27% (2.30-2.9 GHz) around the center frequency of 2.45 GHz were measured. The antenna has an average CP gain of 6.2 dBic across the operating bandwidth and the maximum gain of 6.8 dBic at the center frequency. The size of antenna is 0.45\u03bb\u00d70.45\u03bb\u00d70.24\u03bb.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/6719497/06705593.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"70","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2013.2296324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2013.2296324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719497","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Wideband Circularly Polarized Cross-Dipole Antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dipole antennas","Bandwidth","Impedance","Antenna measurements","Antenna radiation patterns","Broadband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","broadband antennas","dipole antennas","electromagnetic wave polarisation","microwave antennas","printed circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wideband circular polarized antenna","cross dipole antenna","double layered printed circuit board","PCB substrate","ISM band wireless communication","curved delay line","orthogonal phase difference","coaxial cable","square reflector","directional CP radiation pattern","symmetric CP radiation pattern","impedance bandwidth","bandwidth 2.45 GHz","resistance 50 ohm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circularly polarized","cross-dipole","wideband antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Wideband Circularly Polarized Cross-Dipole Antenna","volume":"13","htmlLink":"/document/6705593/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2014","accessionNumber":"14056277","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Wideband Circularly Polarized Cross-Dipole Antenna","sourcePdf":"lawp-wong-2296324-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069482S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6719497","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"6719497","articleId":"6705593","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6705609,"authors":[{"name":"Weihua Zheng","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Weihua","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38667736300"},{"name":"Kenli Li","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Kenli","lastName":"Li","id":"38540610000"},{"name":"Keqin Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, State University of New York, New Paltz, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Keqin","lastName":"Li","id":"37086383740"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6705609","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":630},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705609","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Signal processing algorithms","Computational complexity","Educational institutions","Loss measurement","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scaled discrete Fourier transforms","SDFT","recursively decomposed decimation","rotating factor","real multiplications","radix-2/8 split-radix FFT","modified split-radix FFT","MSRFFT","Wang algorithm","arithmetic complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast Fourier transform (FFT)","modified split-radix FFT (MSRFFT)","radix 2/8 FFT algorithm","scaled discrete Fourier transform (SDFT)","split-radix FFT (SRFFT)"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, we present a fast algorithm for computing length- q\u00d72\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</sup>\n discrete Fourier transforms (DFT).

The new 2-D efficient algorithm is based on the use of an iterative procedure to reduce the splitting error associated with the perturbation term, and it does not involve any nonphysical intermediate variables. Numerical results indicated that the new efficient algorithm shows better performance for modeling some regions with larger spatial derivatives of the field. In this paper, we extend this approach to a full 3-D wave. Numerical formulations of the new 3-D Laguerre-based FDTD method are devised and simulation results are compared to those using the conventional 3-D FDTD method and the alternating-direction implicit (ADI) FDTD method. We numerically verify that, at the comparable accuracy, the efficiency of the proposed method with an iterative procedure is superior to the FDTD method and the ADI -FDTD method. Also, in order to verify the stability of the iterative procedure, we present a convergence analysis and a long-time simulation to it in the paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/6782660/06705615.pdf","startPage":"2158","endPage":"2164","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2014.2298890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2014.2298890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6782660","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Efficient Algorithm for 3-D Laguerre-Based Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Equations","Iterative methods","Mathematical model","Stability analysis","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","finite difference time-domain analysis","iterative methods","stochastic processes","strip lines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D Laguerre based finite difference time domain method","2D Laguerre based finite difference time domain method","iterative procedure","splitting error","perturbation term","nonphysical intermediate variables","alternating direction implicit FDTD method","ADI FDTD method","convergence analysis","electromagnetic wave propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method","iterative method","Laguerre polynomials","unconditionally stable methods"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705615/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"A New Efficient Algorithm for 3-D Laguerre-Based Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","volume":"62","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6705615/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14210786","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Efficient Algorithm for 3-D Laguerre-Based Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method","sourcePdf":"tap-duan-2298890-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072404S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6782660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6782660","articleId":"6705615","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6705616,"authors":[{"name":"Ryosuke Matsumoto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Ryosuke Matsumoto received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

In this paper, we have developed uniformed and sampled SSFBG E/Ds with different refractive index profiles and have compared their code performances in a hybrid 40G-OCDMA-PON system. The experimental results show that the sampled profile improves the code dependent performances presented in many OCDMA systems. We have also demonstrated a full-duplex 4-user \u00d7 40 Gb/s hybrid OCDMA-PON system by applying the sampled SSFBG E/Ds. An asynchronous full-duplex 50 km transmission with a total capacity of 160 Gb/s (4-user \u00d7 40 Gb/s) has been achieved for the first time. Furthermore, we focus on major requirements in NG-PON2 and discuss several issues to introduce the hybrid 40G-OCDMA-PON for optical access networks.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2014.2299070","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/6716046/06705616.pdf","startPage":"1132","endPage":"1143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2014.2299070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6716046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"40G-OCDMA-PON System With an Asymmetric Structure Using a Single Multi-Port and Sampled SSFBG Encoder/Decoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2014","displayDocTitle":"40G-OCDMA-PON System With an Asymmetric Structure Using a Single Multi-Port and Sampled SSFBG Encoder/Decoders","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6705616/","accessionNumber":"14066614","volume":"32","issue":"6","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"March15, 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"40G-OCDMA-PON System With an Asymmetric Structure Using a Single Multi-Port and Sampled SSFBG Encoder/Decoders","sourcePdf":"jlt-matsumoto-2299070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069978S","chronDate":"March15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"6716046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"6716046","articleId":"6705616","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6705618,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Zuo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Zuo","id":"37085472350"},{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404549600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6705618","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":618},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Artificial neural networks","Manganese","Learning systems","Object recognition","Encoding","Image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","image classification","image coding","image representation","independent component analysis","object recognition","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning discriminative hierarchical features","object recognition","hierarchical feature learning methods","linear SVM","image representation","reconstruction independent component analysis","NTU Tree-51","fine-grained image classification dataset","Caltech 101","nonlinear transformation","discriminative hierarchical feature learning method","feature learning","hand-designed local features"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discriminant analysis","hierarchical feature learning","patch-to-class distance","object recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705618","abstract":"Hierarchical feature learning methods have demonstrated substantial improvements over the conventional hand-designed local features. However, recent approaches mainly perform feature learning in an unsupervised manner, where subtle differences between different classes can hardly be captured. In this letter, we propose a discriminative hierarchical feature learning method, which learns a non-linear transformation to encode discriminative information in the feature space. We apply our features on two general image classification benchmarks: Caltech 101, STL-10, and a new fine-grained image classification dataset: NTU Tree-51. The results show that by employing discriminative constraint, our method consistently improves the performance with 3% to 7% in classification accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2014.2298888","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6818457/06705618.pdf","startPage":"1159","endPage":"1163","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2014.2298888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6818457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Discriminative Hierarchical Features for Object Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705618/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Learning Discriminative Hierarchical Features for Object Recognition","volume":"21","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"03 June 2014","accessionNumber":"14348192","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6705618/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Singapore National Research Foundation under its IDM Futures Funding Initiative and administered by the Interactive and Digital Media Programme Office Media Development Authority"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Discriminative Hierarchical Features for Object Recognition","sourcePdf":"lsp-wang-2298888-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05772S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6818457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6818457","articleId":"6705618","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6705620,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Koohestani","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Laboratoire d'Electromagn\u00e9tisme et d'Acous-tique, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Koohestani","id":"37542733900"},{"name":"J.-F.

The higher frequency band |S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</sub>\n| performance is due to the mono-cone while the top-cross-plate is responsible for the lower frequency band. This plate also leads to a height reduction when compared to conventional mono-cone antennas. A comprehensive parametric study is done to provide design guidelines. Both frequency- and time-domain results have been measured and presented to validate the design. Results show that the antenna operates from 3.06 to beyond 12 GHz based on |S\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">11</sub>\n| \u2264 -10 dB, radiates omni-directionally in the H-plane, and has a radiation efficiency over 95%.

The goal of this letter is to present detailed design analysis of a multiple-conductor-layers transmitarray antenna using slot-type element with no dielectric substrate. A transmitarray antenna using quad-layer cross-slot elements has been designed, fabricated, and tested for 11.3 GHz operating frequency. The measured gain of the prototype transmitarray is 23.76 dB at 11.3 GHz. It is observed that the oblique incidence and the wave polarization have strong effect on the transmission coefficient of the slot-type element. Thus, a detailed analysis of the transmitarray considering the oblique incidence angles and the feed polarization conditions is performed with good agreement between the simulation and measured results.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2014.2298851","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/6719497/06705631.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"180","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2014.2298851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmitarray Antenna Design Using Cross-Slot Elements With No Dielectric Substrate","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705631","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705631/","displayDocTitle":"Transmitarray Antenna Design Using Cross-Slot Elements With No Dielectric Substrate","volume":"13","publicationDate":"2014","accessionNumber":"14066929","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6705631/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmitarray Antenna Design Using Cross-Slot Elements With No Dielectric Substrate","sourcePdf":"lawp-abdelrahman-2298851-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111475S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"6719497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"6719497","articleId":"6705631","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6705637,"authors":[{"name":"Dariush Shahgoshtasbi","affiliation":["Autonomous Control Engineering Laboratory, ServiceNow Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4267003/6819870/6705637/shahg-2291943-small.gif","p":["\nDariush Shahgoshtasbi (S'11) received the B.S. degree in computer\nengineering (hardware) and the M.S. degree in computer engineering (artificial intelligence and robotics) from Islamic\nAzad University, Science and Research Branch, Tehran, Iran.

With DR, we can shift electrical load from peak demand time to other periods based on changes in price signal. At residential level, automated energy management systems (EMS) have been developed to assist users in responding to price changes in dynamic pricing systems. In this paper, a new intelligent EMS (iEMS) in a smart house is presented. It consists of two parts: a fuzzy subsystem and an intelligent lookup table. The fuzzy subsystem is based on its fuzzy rules and inputs that produce the proper output for the intelligent lookup table. The second part, whose core is a new model of an associative neural network, is able to map inputs to desired outputs. The structure of the associative neural network is presented and discussed. The intelligent lookup table takes three types of inputs that come from the fuzzy subsystem, outside sensors, and feedback outputs. Whatever is trained in this lookup table are different scenarios in different conditions. This system is able to find the best energy-efficiency scenario in different situations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705637/","volume":"8","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6705637/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14331794","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"A New Intelligent Neuro\u2013Fuzzy Paradigm for Energy-Efficient Homes","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"CPS Energy"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Intelligent Neuro\u2013Fuzzy Paradigm for Energy-Efficient Homes","sourcePdf":"jsyst-shahgoshtasbi-2291943-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055216S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"6819870","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6819870","articleId":"6705637","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6705643,"authors":[{"name":"Xinghua Sun","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong","Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/7041254/6705643/6705643-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xinghua Sun (M'13) received the B.S. degree from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NUPT), Nanjing, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree from City University of Hong Kong (CityU), Hong Kong, in 2013, both in electronic engineering.","From March to July 2010, he was a visiting student with INRIA, Rennes, France.

It has been shown that BEB can achieve the theoretical limit of throughput as long as the initial backoff window size is properly selected. It, however, suffers from significant delay degradation when the network becomes saturated. It is thus of special interest for us to further design backoff schemes for IEEE 802.11 DCF networks that can achieve comparable throughput as BEB, but provide better delay performance. This paper presents a systematic study on the effect of backoff schemes on throughput and delay performance of saturated IEEE 802.11 DCF networks. In particular, a backoff scheme is defined as a sequence of backoff window sizes {Wi}. The analysis shows that a saturated IEEE 802.11 DCF network has a single steady-state operating point as long as {Wi} is a monotonic increasing sequence. The maximum throughput is found to be independent of {Wi}, yet the growth rate of {Wi} determines a fundamental tradeoff between throughput and delay performance. For illustration, Polynomial Backoff is proposed, and the effect of polynomial power x on the network performance is characterized. It is demonstrated that Polynomial Backoff with a larger x is more robust against the fluctuation of the network size, but in the meanwhile suffers from a larger second moment of access delay. Quadratic Backoff (QB), i.e., Polynomial Backoff with x=2, stands out to be a favorable option as it strikes a good balance between throughput and delay performance. The comparative study between QB and BEB confirms that QB well preserves the robust nature of BEB and achieves much better queueing performance than BEB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Backoff Design for IEEE 802.11 DCF Networks: Fundamental Tradeoff and Design Criterion","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2013.2295242","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7041254/06705643.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2013.2295242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7041254","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705643/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Backoff Design for IEEE 802.11 DCF Networks: Fundamental Tradeoff and Design Criterion","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6705643/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14930748","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backoff Design for IEEE 802.11 DCF Networks: Fundamental Tradeoff and Design Criterion","sourcePdf":"tnet-dai-2295242-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.205354S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7041254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7041254","articleId":"6705643","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6705653,"authors":[{"name":"Yunjin Chen","affiliation":["Graz University of Technology, Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision, Graz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6717077/6705653/6705653-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yunjin Chen received the B.Sc. degree in applied physics from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Jiangsu, China, and the M.Sc. degree in optical engineering from the National University of Defense Technology, Hunan, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

First, we give new insights into the co-sparse analysis model by establishing connections to filter-based MRF models, such as the field of experts model of Roth and Black. For training, we introduce a technique called bi-level optimization to learn the analysis operators. Compared with existing analysis operator learning approaches, our training procedure has the advantage that it is unconstrained with respect to the analysis operator. We investigate the effect of different aspects of the co-sparse analysis model and show that the sparsity promoting function (also called penalty function) is the most important factor in the model. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our training approach, we apply our trained models to various classical image restoration problems. Numerical experiments show that our trained models clearly outperform existing analysis operator learning approaches and are on par with state-of-the-art image denoising algorithms. Our approach develops a framework that is intuitive to understand and easy to implement.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2299065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2299065","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6717077","startPage":"1060","endPage":"1072","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6717077/06705653.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705653","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analytical models","Training","Algorithm design and analysis","Optimization","Numerical models","Vectors","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","image restoration","learning (artificial intelligence)","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analysis operator learning","patch-based sparse models","higher order MRF","learning algorithm","co-sparse analysis model","filter-based MRF models","bi-level optimization","training procedure","penalty function","image restoration problems","image denoising algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analysis operator learning","loss-specific training","bi-level optimization","image restoration","MRFs"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Models, Statistical","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Insights Into Analysis Operator Learning: From Patch-Based Sparse Models to Higher Order MRFs","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14056303","pubMedId":"24474375","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6705653/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705653/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Insights Into Analysis Operator Learning: From Patch-Based Sparse Models to Higher Order MRFs","sourcePdf":"tip-chen-2299065-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090602S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6717077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"6717077","articleId":"6705653","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":6705656,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan W.

This paper aims to induce sparsity more strongly than L1 norm regularization, while avoiding non-convex optimization. For this purpose, this paper describes the design and use of non-convex penalty functions (regularizers) constrained so as to ensure the convexity of the total cost function F to be minimized. The method is based on parametric penalty functions, the parameters of which are constrained to ensure convexity of F. It is shown that optimal parameters can be obtained by semidefinite programming (SDP). This maximally sparse convex (MSC) approach yields maximally non-convex sparsity-inducing penalty functions constrained such that the total cost function F is convex. It is demonstrated that iterative MSC (IMSC) can yield solutions substantially more sparse than the standard convex sparsity-inducing approach, i.e., L1 norm minimization.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2298839","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6732988/06705656.pdf","startPage":"1078","endPage":"1092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2298839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6732988","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Signal Estimation by Maximally Sparse Convex Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705656","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705656/","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Signal Estimation by Maximally Sparse Convex Optimization","volume":"62","issue":"5","publicationDate":"March1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14078302","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6705656/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Signal Estimation by Maximally Sparse Convex Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsp-selesnick-2298839-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166253S","chronDate":"March1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6732988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"6732988","articleId":"6705656","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6705663,"authors":[{"name":"Qia Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6717077/6705663/6705663-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qia Wang was born in Shenyang, China, in 1985.

In this paper, we identify a cloud computing application scenario that requires simultaneously performing secure watermark detection and privacy preserving multimedia data storage. We then propose a compressive sensing (CS)-based framework using secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols to address such a requirement. In our framework, the multimedia data and secret watermark pattern are presented to the cloud for secure watermark detection in a CS domain to protect the privacy. During CS transformation, the privacy of the CS matrix and the watermark pattern is protected by the MPC protocols under the semi-honest security model. We derive the expected watermark detection performance in the CS domain, given the target image, watermark pattern, and the size of the CS matrix (but without the CS matrix itself). The correctness of the derived performance has been validated by our experiments. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that secure watermark detection in the CS domain is feasible. Our framework can also be extended to other collaborative secure signal processing and data-mining applications in the cloud.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compressive Sensing Based Secure Watermark Detection and Privacy Preserving Storage Framework","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2298980","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6717077/06705663.pdf","startPage":"1317","endPage":"1328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2298980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6717077","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705663","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705663/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Compressive Sensing Based Secure Watermark Detection and Privacy Preserving Storage Framework","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6705663/","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14066947","pubMedId":"24723529","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compressive Sensing Based Secure Watermark Detection and Privacy Preserving Storage Framework","sourcePdf":"tip-wang-2298980-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094386S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6717077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6717077","articleId":"6705663","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6705664,"authors":[{"name":"Desheng Dash Wu","affiliation":["RiskLab, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/6856252/6705664/wu-2295353-small.gif","p":["Desheng Dash Wu is an Affiliate Professor and Managing Director with the RiskLab, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

The methodology integrates popular sentiment analysis into machine learning approaches based on support vector machine and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity modeling. A typical financial website called Sina Finance has been selected as an experimental platform where a corpus of financial review data was collected. Empirical results suggest solid correlations between stock price volatility trends and stock forum sentiment. Computational results show that the statistical machine learning approach has a higher classification accuracy than that of the semantic approach. Results also imply that investor sentiment has a particularly strong effect for value stocks relative to growth stocks.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/6856252/06705664.pdf","startPage":"1077","endPage":"1087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2013.2295353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2013.2295353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6856252","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705664","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Decision Support Approach for Online Stock Forum Sentiment Analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Indexes","Predictive models","Stock markets","Training","Tagging","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","decision making","Internet","investment","learning (artificial intelligence)","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","statistical analysis","stock markets","support vector machines","text analysis","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision support approach","online stock forum sentiment analysis","Internet","online opinion posts","investor investment decision making","stock company risk perception","sentiment ontology","context-sensitive sentiment analysis","stock markets","support vector machine","generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity modeling","financial Website","Sina Finance","financial review data","stock price volatility trend","statistical machine learning approach","classification accuracy","semantic approach","investor sentiment","value stocks","growth stocks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Decision support","generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH)","sentiment analysis","stock price","support vector machine (SVM)","volatility"]},{"kwd":["Decision support","generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH)","sentiment analysis","stock price","support vector machine (SVM)","volatility"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705664/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Decision Support Approach for Online Stock Forum Sentiment Analysis","volume":"44","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6705664/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14450826","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"100 Talents Programme of The Chinese Academy of Sciences and 1000-talents Program by the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee in China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Decision Support Approach for Online Stock Forum Sentiment Analysis","sourcePdf":"tsmc-wu-2295353-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093396S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"6856252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"6856252","articleId":"6705664","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6705673,"authors":[{"name":"Michele A.

The approach relies on a spatio-temporal model of video scenes in the discrete cosine transform domain, and on a model that characterizes the type of motion occurring in the scenes, to predict video quality. We use the models to define video statistics and perceptual features that are the basis of a video quality assessment (VQA) algorithm that does not require the presence of a pristine video to compare against in order to predict a perceptual quality score. The contributions of this paper are threefold. 1) We propose a spatio-temporal natural scene statistics (NSS) model for videos. 2) We propose a motion model that quantifies motion coherency in video scenes. 3) We show that the proposed NSS and motion coherency models are appropriate for quality assessment of videos, and we utilize them to design a blind VQA algorithm that correlates highly with human judgments of quality. The proposed algorithm, called video BLIINDS, is tested on the LIVE VQA database and on the EPFL-PoliMi video database and shown to perform close to the level of top performing reduced and full reference VQA algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2299154","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6717077/06705673.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6717077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2299154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"1352","endPage":"1365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Prediction of Natural Video Quality","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Blind Prediction of Natural Video Quality","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705673/","volume":"23","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6705673/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14066956","pubMedId":"24723532","dateOfInsertion":"05 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Prediction of Natural Video Quality","sourcePdf":"tip-saad-2299154-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106465S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6717077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"6717077","articleId":"6705673","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6705678,"authors":[{"name":"Asha Viswanath","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Systems and Management, Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, U.A.E."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/6823199/6705678/viswa-2293340-small.gif","p":["\nAsha Viswanath received the Ph.D. degree in structural engineering in\n2011 from the University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K., working with the Computational Engineering and Design\nGroup.","She is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Department of Engineering Systems and Management, Masdar\nInstitute of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, U.A.E.

As infrastructure systems, they must be planned and operated to accommodate the uncertain and continually evolving needs of their passengers and freight. New roads are planned or existing roads are closed for maintenance or due to operational breakdowns. Reconfigurable transportation systems are those which adapt to these changes quickly and efficiently. They are not overdesigned with capabilities that may be left unused; instead, capabilities are added only when needed, thus supporting the need for resilient infrastructure. An axiomatic-design-for-large-flexible-systems approach is chosen as a methodology for its deep roots in engineering design. It addresses systems where the functionality not only evolves over time, but also can be fulfilled by one or more system resources, and is used here to enumerate passenger itineraries. This paper builds upon a recent work in which axiomatic design was used to develop a theory of degrees of freedom in transportation systems for their reconfigurable design and operation. The methodological developments are then demonstrated on a small subsection of the Mexico City transportation system to demonstrate its wide-ranging utility in reconfigurability decision-making at the planning and operation timescales. In addition, further comparisons of axiomatic design to traditional graph theory are made, indicating the mathematical basis of the former in the latter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Axiomatic Design Approach to Passenger Itinerary Enumeration in Reconfigurable Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2013.2293340","startPage":"915","endPage":"924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2013.2293340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6823199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/6823199/06705678.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","displayDocTitle":"An Axiomatic Design Approach to Passenger Itinerary Enumeration in Reconfigurable Transportation Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6705678/","dateOfInsertion":"29 May 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14349246","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Axiomatic Design Approach to Passenger Itinerary Enumeration in Reconfigurable Transportation Systems","sourcePdf":"tits-viswanath-2293340-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131897S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6823199","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6823199","articleId":"6705678","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6705688,"authors":[{"name":"Jungwoo Shin","affiliation":["Department of Civil, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/17/6853426/6705688/6705688-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jungwoo Shin received the B.S. degree in mathematics from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, and the Ph.D. degree from Technology Management, Economics and Policy Program, Seoul National University, Korea.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.

Although there is a need for studies with a managerial relevance for this emerging market, the lack of market analysis hampers such investigations. Therefore, this study focuses on the end-user market for cloud computing in Korea. We conduct a quantitative analysis to show consumer adoption behavior for these services, particularly infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Bayesian mixed logit model and the multivariate probit model are used to analyze the data collected by a conjoint survey. From this analysis, we find that the service fee and stability are the most critical adoption factors. We also present an analysis on the relationship between terminal devices and IaaS, classified by core attributes such as price, stability, and storage capacity. From these relationships, we find that larger storage capacity is more important for mobile devices such as laptops than desktops. Based on the results of the analysis, this study also recommends useful strategies to enable enterprise managers to focus on more appropriate service attributes, and to target suitable terminal device markets matching the features of the service.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Strategic Management of Cloud Computing Services: Focusing on Consumer Adoption Behavior","doi":"10.1109/TEM.2013.2295829","startPage":"419","endPage":"427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEM.2013.2295829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6853426","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/17/6853426/06705688.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Strategic Management of Cloud Computing Services: Focusing on Consumer Adoption Behavior","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"61","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6705688/","dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14450643","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strategic Management of Cloud Computing Services: Focusing on Consumer Adoption Behavior","sourcePdf":"tem-shin-2295829-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101665S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"17","isNumber":"6853426","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"17","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"6853426","articleId":"6705688","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6705704,"authors":[{"name":"Jinli Suo","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6717077/6705704/6705704-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinli Suo received the B.S. degree in computer science from Shandong University, Shandong, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from the Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2010.

The solution is nontrivial due to the fact that two deteriorations co-occur during capturing and noise is nonlinearly dependent on signal strength. To handle this problem, we propose conducting noise separation and super resolution under a unified optimization framework, which models both spatiotemporal priors of high quality videos and signal-dependent noise. Mathematically, we align the frames along temporal axis and pursue the solution under the following three criterion: 1) the sharp noise-free image stack is low rank with some missing pixels denoting occlusions; 2) the noise follows a given nonlinear noise model; and 3) the recovered sharp image can be reconstructed well with sparse coefficients and an over complete dictionary learned from high quality natural images. In computation aspects, we propose to obtain the final result by solving a convex optimization using the modern local linearization techniques. In the experiments, we validate the proposed approach in both synthetic and real captured data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705704/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6705704/","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14066945","pubMedId":"24723520","volume":"23","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Joint Non-Gaussian Denoising and Superresolving of Raw High Frame Rate Videos","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Non-Gaussian Denoising and Superresolving of Raw High Frame Rate Videos","sourcePdf":"tip-suo-2298976-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106573S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6717077","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6717077","articleId":"6705704","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6705710,"authors":[{"name":"Samuel T.

A preprocessor design based on phase feedback information enables the proposed scheme to achieve full diversity order as well as a coding advantage.

A quantized feedback analysis of the proposed scheme for quasi-static flat Rayleigh fading channels is also considered. Monte Carlo simulations are performed for different closed-loop space-time block codes with four transmit antennas and unitary transmission rate. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme achieves full diversity order and outperforms other good schemes in terms of coding gain and decoding delay.","doi":"10.1109/CITS.2013.6705710","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Computer, Information and Telecommunication Systems (CITS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689710/6705707/06705710.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CITS.2013.6705710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705707","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity rate-one MIMO scheme with four transmit antennas and phase feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity rate-one MIMO scheme with four transmit antennas and phase feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 May 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705710/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-8 May 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"14026249","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6705710/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity rate-one MIMO scheme with four transmit antennas and phase feedback","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"1569715433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078474S","chronDate":"7-8 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689710","isNumber":"6705707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689710","xplore-issue":"6705707","articleId":"6705710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6705719,"authors":[{"name":"Prodromos Makris","affiliation":["Department of Information & Communication Systems Engineering University of the Aegean, Samos, GR, Island"],"firstName":"Prodromos","lastName":"Makris","id":"37882687100"},{"name":"Dimitrios N.

Machine Type communications (MTC) will play a critical role in this evolution and thus both architectural and algorithmic enhancements to existing converged mobile and fixed network infrastructures are needed. In this paper, we focus on resource management issues for combined Human-to-Human (H2H) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) traffic. The proposed Context-Aware Backhaul Management (CABM) scheme is applicable for M2M gateways, which can provide the interconnection between cellular and capillary networks both via wired and wireless backhaul alternatives. CABM scheme adopts efficient QoS provisioning procedures, by taking into consideration the diverse QoS requirements of novel MTC services. Simulation results show that the proposed MTC Request Admission Control (MTCR-AC) algorithm is resilient regarding QoS-related metrics in overload-state situations, while its inherent prediction-based decision-making procedures can offer significant performance gains, too.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-8 May 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-8 May 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6705719/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"May 2013","accessionNumber":"14026244","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Context-Aware Backhaul Management solution for combined H2H and M2M traffic","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Context-Aware Backhaul Management solution for combined H2H and M2M traffic","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"1569729717.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058059S","chronDate":"7-8 May 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689710","isNumber":"6705707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689710","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6705707","articleId":"6705719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6705746,"authors":[{"name":"Anwar Jarndal","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Sharjah, Sharjah, UAE"],"firstName":"Anwar","lastName":"Jarndal","id":"37294476700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0724-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0722-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0723-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6705746","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Load modeling","Neural networks","Load forecasting","Predictive models","Fuzzy logic","Humidity","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric humidity","atmospheric temperature","fuzzy logic","genetic algorithms","load forecasting","neural nets","power engineering computing","power system planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system planning","genetic fuzzy neural network","economical utilization","midterm load forecasting","atmospheric humidity","atmospheric temperature","power system load"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Load forecasting","fuzzy logic","neural networks","genetic optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705746","abstract":"Prediction of future load demand is important for secure operation of power systems and their economical utilization.

Spatial multiplexing involves transmitting independent streams of data across multiple antennas to maximize throughput. Closed-loop spatial multiplexing adapt the system to the current channel state throughout a limited feedback channel. In This scheme precoding matrix selection is performed by the user equipment (UE) while applying the selected matrix by the transmitter. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for precoding matrix selection, based on QR decomposition and minimum mean square error (MMSE), which has an attractive performance and computational complexity gain, so it can be used to efficiently select precoding matrix at UE side. A review over the existent selection techniques is introduced. Also we provide a comparison between the performance of the proposed techniques and the ones in the review in terms of bit error rate (BER) and computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/IEEEGCC.2013.6705756","publicationTitle":"2013 7th IEEE GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th IEEE GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695808/6705733/06705756.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEEGCC.2013.6705756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705733","startPage":"93","endPage":"97","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified QR-D and MMSE PMI selection technique for MIMO closed loop spatial multiplexing in LTE/LTE-advanced","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modified QR-D and MMSE PMI selection technique for MIMO closed loop spatial multiplexing in LTE/LTE-advanced","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705756/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029516","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6705756/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified QR-D and MMSE PMI selection technique for MIMO closed loop spatial multiplexing in LTE/LTE-advanced","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"p93wagdy.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067888S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695808","isNumber":"6705733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695808","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6705733","articleId":"6705756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6705757,"authors":[{"name":"\u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00d6zdemir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"\u00d6zg\u00fcr","lastName":"\u00d6zdemir","id":"37266325100"},{"name":"Ridha Hamila","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Ridha","lastName":"Hamila","id":"37282475100"},{"name":"Naofal Al-Dhahir","affiliation":["University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, US"],"firstName":"Naofal","lastName":"Al-Dhahir"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0724-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0722-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0723-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6705757","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":566},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receivers","Transmitters","Indexes","Estimation","Baseband","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","equalisers","OFDM modulation","packet radio networks","radio receivers","radio transmitters","software radio","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["USRP-based experimental testbed","OFDM system","USRP RF front-end","receiver","transmitter","RX I-Q imbalance compensation","time-domain analysis","TX I-Q imbalance compensation","frequency-domain analysis","two-tap equalizer","in-phase-quadrature branch","universal software radio peripheral"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["I/Q imbalance","OFDM","SISO","experimental testbed","IEEE 802.11.a","USRP N210"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an experimental testbed for packet based OFDM systems is proposed using USRP RF front-ends.

More recently, high-definition (HD) cameras are used for providing better performance in ANPR system. However, most known approaches for standard definition (SD) number plate localisation (NPL) are not suitable for real-time HD image processing as the real-time requirement cannot be met due to the computationally intensive cost of localising the number plate. In this paper, a solution to link previously designed architectures for NPL, character segmentation and character recognition in a SD ANPR system is first described. The system is to be implemented on a single stand-alone FPGA-based processing unit. An approach to extend the SD ANPR system to HD ANPR system without significantly increasing the computational cost is then introduced.","doi":"10.1109/IEEEGCC.2013.6705778","publicationTitle":"2013 7th IEEE GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th IEEE GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695808/6705733/06705778.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEEGCC.2013.6705778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705733","startPage":"214","endPage":"219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Standard definition ANPR system on FPGA and an approach to extend it to HD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Standard definition ANPR system on FPGA and an approach to extend it to HD","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705778/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029426","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6705778/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Standard definition ANPR system on FPGA and an approach to extend it to HD","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"p214zhai.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084891S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695808","isNumber":"6705733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695808","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6705733","articleId":"6705778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6705799,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Imtiaz Hussain","affiliation":["Texas A&M University at Qatar, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Syed Imtiaz","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37544466200"},{"name":"Mohamed M.

Regardless of its many advantages, FSO severely suffers from poor performance over medium to long range links. This could be overcome by deploying relays in the system in serial or parallel fashion. For a dual-hop FSO system with multiple parallel relays, all-relay communication needs perfect synchronization among the participating relays, resulting in a very complex transmission process. This may be avoided by selecting a single relay based on a certain metric. However, due to peak and/or average power constrains in the system, power optimization among few \u201cbest\u201d relays may provide an optimum performance. In this paper, we first investigate selective relaying in an FSO system with parallel relays operating in amplify-and-forward (AF) mode under log-normal fading. We derive outage probability of the system in case a single relay is selected on the basis of maximum end-to-end signal to noise ration (SNR). The latter part of the paper discusses a power optimization technique among few relays with peak and average power constraints. Simulation results show that in the absence of power constraints single relay selection performs better whereas power optimization among few selected relays is more efficient with power constraints.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power optimization and k<sup>th</sup> order selective relaying in free space optical networks","publicationTitle":"2013 7th IEEE GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCC)","doi":"10.1109/IEEEGCC.2013.6705799","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th IEEE GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695808/6705733/06705799.pdf","startPage":"330","endPage":"333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEEGCC.2013.6705799","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705733","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705799","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Power optimization and k<sup>th</sup> order selective relaying in free space optical networks","conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6705799/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029483","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power optimization and k<sup>th</sup> order selective relaying in free space optical networks","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"p330hussain.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056428S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695808","isNumber":"6705733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695808","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6705733","articleId":"6705799","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6705820,"authors":[{"name":"R.

EPWT, when applied upon images, operates along the permutations of original image indices exploiting the local correlations in an uncomplicated manner. The highly correlated array of function values when passed through one-dimensional wavelet filters produce wavelet coefficients of minimum magnitude. Consequently high compression ratio is achieved after the application of a wavelet shrinkage procedure on the reconstructed images. Thus the image can be represented in terms of its wavelet decomposition coefficients and the respective path vectors obtained at all levels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 7th IEEE GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695808/6705733/06705844.pdf","startPage":"583","endPage":"588","publicationTitle":"2013 7th IEEE GCC Conference and Exhibition (GCC)","doi":"10.1109/IEEEGCC.2013.6705844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEEGCC.2013.6705844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705733","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6705844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive geometric wavelet transform based two dimensional data compression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Vectors","Image coding","Indexes","Tensile stress","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["filtering theory","image coding","image representation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive geometric wavelet transform based two dimensional data compression","EPWT","easy path wavelet transform","wavelet based compression technique","image intensity points","sparse representation","wavelet shrinkage procedure","wavelet decomposition coefficients","one-dimensional wavelet filters","original image","local correlations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sparse representation of image","adaptive wavelet transform","geometric wavelet transform","EPWT"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6705844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive geometric wavelet transform based two dimensional data compression","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6705844/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029533","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive geometric wavelet transform based two dimensional data compression","confLoc":"Doha, Qatar","sourcePdf":"p583razanaqvi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058835S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695808","isNumber":"6705733","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695808","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6705733","articleId":"6705844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6705865,"authors":[{"name":"Mrigank Sharad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Mrigank","lastName":"Sharad","id":"37845785900"},{"name":"Deliang Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Deliang","lastName":"Fan","id":"37060955700"},{"name":"Karthik Yogendra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Karthik","lastName":"Yogendra","id":"37061093800"},{"name":"Kaushik Roy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Kaushik","lastName":"Roy","id":"37274519700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3372-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6705865","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":498},"abstract":"Emerging spin transfer torque (ST) devices such as lateral spin valves and domain wall magnets may lead to ultra-low-voltage, current-mode, spin-torque switches that can offer attractive computing capabilities, beyond digital switches.

Unlike traditional MIMO systems, complementary codes were designed at chip-level to achieve time and frequency-spreading for each antenna. We analyze the system performance in multipath fading channels. A closed form expression of bit error rate (BER) performance is obtained. Extensive simulations were conducted to verify the analytical results. Our results indicate that a CC coded MIMO system can effectively decrease BER and take advantage of diversity gain.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/6797984/06706233.pdf","startPage":"181","endPage":"184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2014.010414.130726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2014.010414.130726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797984","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Complete Complementary Coded MIMO System and Its Performance in Multipath Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Fading","Bit error rate","Wireless communication","Encoding","Antennas","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","code division multiple access","codes","error statistics","fading channels","MIMO communication","multipath channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity gain","BER","bit error rate","multipath fading channels","antenna","frequency-spreading","time-spreading","wireless channels","multicarrier MIMO CDMA system","CC codes","complete complementary codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","space-time coding","complete complementary code"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Complete Complementary Coded MIMO System and Its Performance in Multipath Channels","volume":"3","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6706233/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14239324","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Complete Complementary Coded MIMO System and Its Performance in Multipath Channels","sourcePdf":"181-wcl1404-han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055867S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6797984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6797984","articleId":"6706233","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6706236,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Han Lee","affiliation":["Academia Sinica, Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-Han","lastName":"Lee","id":"38240441500"},{"name":"Cheng-Yu Shih","affiliation":["Academia Sinica, Research Center for Information Technology Innovation, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cheng-Yu","lastName":"Shih","id":"37071601600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6706236","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":725},"abstract":"In heterogeneous networks, interference is one of the critical issues. In this letter, we consider a two-tier downlink network composed of macrocell base stations (MBSs) and femtocell base stations (FBSs), where the locations of MBSs and FBSs are modeled by two independent Poisson point processes (PPPs). FBSs are assumed to be cognitive and become inactive when within a certain range of active MBSs. Due to the inactivation regions, the location distribution of active FBSs no longer follows PPP, complicating the calculation of coverage probability. To circumvent this, we propose an approximation to the coverage probability for both the open access and closed access policies.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962382/6797984/06706236.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"180","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/WCL.2013.123013.130800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCL.2013.123013.130800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6797984","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coverage Analysis of Cognitive Femtocell Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Approximation methods","Aggregates","Radio frequency","Femtocell networks","Base stations","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","femtocellular radio","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coverage probability","inactivation region","independent Poisson point process","femto-cell base station","macrocell base station","two-tier downlink network","heterogeneous networks","coverage analysis","cognitive femtocell networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocells","stochastic geometry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Coverage Analysis of Cognitive Femtocell Networks","volume":"3","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6706236/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14239317","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coverage Analysis of Cognitive Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"177-wcl1404-lee.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074966S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962382","isNumber":"6797984","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962382","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6797984","articleId":"6706236","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6706239,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Ren Peng","affiliation":["KDDI R&D Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Wei-Ren","lastName":"Peng","id":"38182559700"},{"name":"Hidenori Takahashi","affiliation":["KDDI R&D Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hidenori","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37278586100"},{"name":"Takehiro Tsuritani","affiliation":["KDDI R&D Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Takehiro","lastName":"Tsuritani","id":"37281604300"},{"name":"Itsuro Morita","affiliation":["KDDI R&D Laboratories, Inc., Fujimino, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Itsuro","lastName":"Morita","id":"38202262200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-55752-950-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-381X"}],"articleNumber":"6706239","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":52},"abstract":"We successfully generate 11.2-GBd PDM-64QAM using one I/Q modulator driven with eight-level signals synthesized by all binary electrical inputs.

Efficient video encoder VLSI architecture design suffers from several challenges and multiple target performance trade-off. Algorithm and hardware architecture are supposed to be jointly designed for multiple target performance trade-off. How to evaluate the performance, accounting for multiple target performance parameters, is one important problem for algorithm and architecture joint design. In this paper, we propose measure methods for multiple target performance parameters for VLSI architecture design, and then propose a novel multiple-target performance evaluation model. The performances of the prevalent H.264/AVC encoder architectures are evaluated with the proposed model.

While numerous face recognition methods have been proposed over the past two decades, most of them recognize persons from whole face images. In many real world applications, partial faces usually occur in unconstrained scenarios such as visual surveillance systems. Hence, it is very important to recognize an arbitrary facial patch to enhance the intelligence of such systems. In this paper, we develop a robust partial face recognition approach based on local feature representation, where the similarity between each probe patch and gallery face is computed by using the instance-to-class distance with the sparse constraint.

To further decrease the necessary measurements and get more efficient recovery of a signal x, recent approaches assume that x lives in a union of subspaces (UoS). Unlike previous approaches, this paper proposes a novel method to sample and recover an unknown signal from a union of data-driven subspaces (UoDS). Instead of a fix set of supports, this UoDS is learned from classified signal series which are uniquely formed by block matching. The basis of these data-driven subspaces is regularized after dimensionality reduction by principal component extraction. A corresponding recovery solution with provable performance guarantees is also given, which takes full advantage of block-sparsity structure and improves the recovery efficiency. In practice, the proposed scheme is fulfilled to sample and recover frames in video sequences. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed video sampling behaves better performance in sampling and recovery than the classical CS.","doi":"10.1109/VCIP.2013.6706390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VCIP.2013.6706390","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693803/6706319/06706390.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive video sampling from a union of data-driven subspaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Compressive video sampling from a union of data-driven subspaces","conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706390/","accessionNumber":"14028619","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706390/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive video sampling from a union of data-driven subspaces","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"642CR20130811123349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048201S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693803","isNumber":"6706319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693803","xplore-issue":"6706319","articleId":"6706390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6706403,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangwei Li","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiangwei","lastName":"Li","id":"37859265600"},{"name":"Xuguang Lan","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xuguang","lastName":"Lan","id":"37270865300"},{"name":"Meng Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Yang","id":"38064512700"},{"name":"Jianru Xue","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Jianru","lastName":"Xue","id":"37402347300"},{"name":"Nanning Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Nanning","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37271536700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0290-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0288-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6706403","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","Image coding","Computational modeling","Computational complexity","Compressed sensing","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","compressed sensing","computational complexity","data compression","image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["universal quantizer design","low-complexity quantizer design","compressive sensing image coding","compressive sensing imaging","CSI system","image coding","CS encoder shifts","system complexity","decoder","lossless compression","lossy compression","universal probability model","optimal rate-distortion","computational complexity","CS encoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing imaging","quantization","Gaussian distribution","image coding"]}],"abstract":"Compressive sensing imaging (CSI) is a new framework for image coding, which enables acquiring and compressing a scene simultaneously.

The proposed method firstly establishes a universal probability model for the CS measurements in advance, without knowing any information of the input image. Then a fast quantizer is designed based on this established model. Simulation result demonstrates that the proposed method has nearly optimal rate-distortion (R~D) performance, meanwhile, maintains a very low computational complexity at the CS encoder.","doi":"10.1109/VCIP.2013.6706403","publicationTitle":"2013 Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693803/6706319/06706403.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VCIP.2013.6706403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706319","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal and low-complexity quantizer design for compressive sensing image coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Universal and low-complexity quantizer design for compressive sensing image coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706403/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14028711","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6706403/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal and low-complexity quantizer design for compressive sensing image coding","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"709CR20130807103334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061532S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693803","isNumber":"6706319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693803","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6706319","articleId":"6706403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6706414,"authors":[{"name":"G.B.

But for the purpose of low-latency, better memory-bandwidth efficiency and cache performance, it is needed to implement SAO filter at CTU level, along with other encode modules, for majority applications. As well, if any ASIC to be developed for HEVC, all modules are very much expected to execute at CTU/CU level for better pipeline performance. In this paper, we present two methods to carry out SAO offset estimation at CTU level. The proposed two methods are very suitable for the realization in pipe-lined architectures including both software and hardware solutions. Our experimentation results demonstrate that, the proposed two methods produce similar results as SAO frame level results, for both video quality & bit-rate by improving the memory bandwidth and cache performance efficiency.","publicationTitle":"2013 Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693803/6706319/06706414.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and approximation of SAO estimation for CTU-level HEVC encoder","doi":"10.1109/VCIP.2013.6706414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VCIP.2013.6706414","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and approximation of SAO estimation for CTU-level HEVC encoder","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14040356","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6706414/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and approximation of SAO estimation for CTU-level HEVC encoder","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"765CR20130814205927.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03486S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693803","isNumber":"6706319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693803","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6706319","articleId":"6706414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6706434,"authors":[{"name":"Mihails Pudzs","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Computer Science, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Mihails","lastName":"Pudzs","id":"37567477300"},{"name":"Rihards Fuksis","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Computer Science, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Rihards","lastName":"Fuksis","id":"37567474400"},{"name":"Modris Greitans","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Computer Science, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Modris","lastName":"Greitans","id":"37568146100"},{"name":"Teodors Eglitis","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Computer Science, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Teodors","lastName":"Eglitis","id":"37075883400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0290-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0288-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6706434","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Approximation methods","Convolution","Matched filters","Accuracy","Feature extraction","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computational complexity","Gabor filters","image processing","matched filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast matched filters","line crossings","conventional matched filtering","generalized complex matched filtering","GCMF","image processing","filter kernel decomposition method","Gabor filters","spiculation filters","steerable MF","mask kernel approximation","computationally efficient filters","computation complexity","PSNR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image processing","convolution","kernel decomposition","matched filtering"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bank of fast matched filters by decomposing the filter kernel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706434","doi":"10.1109/VCIP.2013.6706434","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693803/6706319/06706434.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VCIP.2013.6706434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706319","abstract":"In this paper we introduce a bank of fast matched filters that are designed to extract gradients, edges, lines and various line crossings.

Filter kernel decomposition method is demonstrated for the latter mentioned (GCMF) but can be similarly applied to any other filters (like MF, CMF, Gabor filters, spiculation filters, steerable MF, etc.) as well. By introducing the mask kernel approximation, we show how to substitute the GCMF with several more computationally efficient filters, which reduce the overall computation complexity by over hundred of times.

Together with the color image, the corresponding range data provides additional information and makes visual analysis tasks more tractable. However, since the depth maps captured by such sensors are typically with limited resolution, it is preferable to enhance its resolution for improved recognition. In this paper, we present a novel joint trilateral filtering (JTF) algorithm for solving depth map super-resolution (SR) problems. Inspired by bilateral filtering, our JTF utilizes and preserves edge information from the associated high-resolution (HR) image by taking spatial and range information of local pixels. Our proposed further integrates local gradient information of the depth map when synthesizing its HR output, which alleviates textural artifacts like edge discontinuities. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach over prior depth map upsampling works.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VCIP.2013.6706444","publicationTitle":"2013 Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693803/6706319/06706444.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/VCIP.2013.6706444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint trilateral filtering for depth map super-resolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Joint trilateral filtering for depth map super-resolution","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6706444/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14028721","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706444/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint trilateral filtering for depth map super-resolution","confLoc":"Kuching, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"972CR20130815015252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050253S","chronDate":"17-20 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693803","isNumber":"6706319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693803","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6706319","articleId":"6706444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6706478,"authors":[{"name":"Siti Musliha Ajmal Binti Mokhtar","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Teknologi Mara, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Siti Musliha Ajmal Binti","lastName":"Mokhtar","id":"37085729605"},{"name":"Wan Fazlida Hanim Wan Abdullah","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University Teknologi Mara, Selangor, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Wan Fazlida Hanim Wan","lastName":"Abdullah","id":"38192098100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1183-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1181-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6706478","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1280},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706478","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Delays","Inverters","Resistance","Mathematical model","Integrated circuit modeling","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit simulation","delay circuits","invertors","memristors","passive networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memristor based delay element","current starved inverter","passive element","LTspice memristor model","memristor mathematical model","memristor resistance","circuit simulation","circuit functionality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["memristor applications","memristor resistance spice model","tristate invert","delay element"]}],"abstract":"This paper will first review on some applications of newly found passive element, the memristor. Utilizing the beneficial characteristic of memristor where it can remember its last state, more and more improvements on today electronic designs has been proposed. However, it is crucial to observe the behavior of memristor model before applying into circuits, especially when the memristor is coupled with other devices. In this paper, LTspice memristor model is used to simulate memristor behavior and applied to the basic delay element circuit. The circuit used a tristate inverter as the delay element. It controls the current flowing to the parasitic capacitor, thus controlling the delay. The compatibility of memristor with the delay element is also in consideration to ensure the functionality of the circuits. At the end, a basic delay element using inverter and memristor is presented. This paper is divided into 4 sections, including the introduction where few examples of memristor applications are explained. It follows by next section where the inverter delay characteristic is narrated. Section 3 is about a mathematical model of memristor that been used to provide a specific memristor resistance in order to get certain delay value during simulation. Using LT spice, a memristor based delay circuit design is then proposed and the delay is observed by circuit simulation. In conclusion, the calculated R and delay value is then compared to the simulation result in order to verify circuit functionality.","doi":"10.1109/RSM.2013.6706478","publicationTitle":"RSM 2013 IEEE Regional Symposium on Micro and Nanoelectronics","displayPublicationTitle":"RSM 2013 IEEE Regional Symposium on Micro and Nanoelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6685220/6706457/06706478.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"84","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RSM.2013.6706478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memristor based delay element using current starved inverter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Memristor based delay element using current starved inverter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14025545","htmlLink":"/document/6706478/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memristor based delay element using current starved inverter","confLoc":"Daerah Langkawi, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"021MemristorBasedDelay.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041135S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6685220","isNumber":"6706457","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6685220","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6706457","articleId":"6706478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6706481,"authors":[{"name":"Abolfazl Zokaei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, South Tehran Branch, Tehran, IRAN"],"firstName":"Abolfazl","lastName":"Zokaei","id":"37085351565"},{"name":"Amir Amirabadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, South Tehran Branch, Tehran, IRAN"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Amirabadi","id":"37273603500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1183-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1181-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6706481","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":368},"abstract":"This paper presents the design and simulation results of a tunable multi-band Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) for mobile WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e) using 0.18\u03bcm CMOS process.

Therefore, noise removal and downsampling have become essential steps in 3D data processing. In this work, we propose the use of a 3D filtering and downsampling technique based on a Growing Neural Gas (GNG) network. GNG method is able to deal with outliers presents in the input data. These features allows to represent 3D spaces, obtaining an induced Delaunay Triangulation of the input space. Experiments show how GNG method yields better input space adaptation to noisy data than other filtering and downsampling methods like Voxel Grid. It is also demonstrated how the state-of-the-art keypoint detectors improve their performance using filtered data with GNG network. Descriptors extracted on improved keypoints perform better matching in robotics applications as 3D scene registration.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706719","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706719","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706719.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Point cloud data filtering and downsampling using growing neural gas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Point cloud data filtering and downsampling using growing neural gas","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706719/","accessionNumber":"14027095","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706719/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Point cloud data filtering and downsampling using growing neural gas","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119026S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6706723,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Similarly, bootstrapping aims to increase the validity of estimating the expected accuracy by repeatedly sub-sampling the data with replacement, creating overlapping samples of the data. Estimates are then used to anticipate of future risk in decision making, or to guide model selection where multiple candidates are feasible. Beyond error estimation, bootstrapping has recently been extended to combine each of the diverse models created for estimation, and aggregating over each of their predictions (rather than their errors), coined bootstrap aggregation or bagging. However, similar extensions of cross-validation to create diverse forecasting models have not been considered. In accordance with bagging, we propose to combine the benefits of cross-validation and forecast aggregation, i.e. crogging. We assesses different levels of cross-validation, including a (single-fold) hold-out approach, 2-fold and 10-fold cross validation and Monte-Carlos cross validation, to create diverse base-models of neural networks for time series prediction trained on different data subsets, and average their individual multiple-step ahead predictions. Results of forecasting the 111 time series of the NN3 competition indicate significant improvements accuracy through Crogging relative to Bagging or individual model selection of neural networks.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706740","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706740.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crogging (cross-validation aggregation) for forecasting \u2014 A novel algorithm of neural network ensembles on time series subsamples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Crogging (cross-validation aggregation) for forecasting \u2014 A novel algorithm of neural network ensembles on time series subsamples","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14027097","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6706740/","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crogging (cross-validation aggregation) for forecasting \u2014 A novel algorithm of neural network ensembles on time series subsamples","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077349S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":6706741,"authors":[{"name":"C.

For the FFNN, the learning rule used to adjust the filter weights is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method and Bayesian approach by the assumption of the prior distributions. In addition, a heuristic law is used to relate the time series roughness with the tuning process. The input patterns for both NN-based and kernel models are the values of rainfall time series after applying a time-delay operator. Hence, the NN's outputs will tend to approximate the current value of the time series. The time lagged inputs of the GP and their covariance functions are both determined via a multicriteria genetic algorithm, called NSGA-II. The optimization criteria are the quantity of inputs and the filter's performance on the known data which leads to Pareto optimal solutions. Both filters - FFNN and GP Kernel - are tested over a rainfall time series obtained from La Sevillana establishment. This work proposed a comparison of well-known filter referenced in early work where the contribution resides in the analysis of the best horizon of the forecasted rainfall time series proposed by Bayesian adjustment. The performance attained is shown by the forecast of the next 15 months values of rainfall time series from La Sevillana establishment located in (-31\u00b0 1'22.46\"S, 62\u00b040'9.57\"O) Balnearia, Cordoba, Argentina.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706741","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706741.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a Gaussian process and feed-forward neural networks based filter for forecasting short rainfall time series","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time series analysis","Filtering algorithms","Adaptive filters","Bayes methods","Training","Kernel","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","covariance analysis","feedforward neural nets","Gaussian processes","genetic algorithms","geophysics computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","Pareto optimisation","rain","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian process analysis","feed-forward neural network-based filter analysis","short-rainfall time series forecasting","GP kernel-based filter analysis","FFNN-based filter analysis","learning rule","filter weights","Levenberg-Marquardt method","Bayesian approach","heuristic law","time series roughness","tuning process","input patterns","NN-based models","time-delay operator","NN outputs","time lagged inputs","covariance functions","multicriteria genetic algorithm","NSGA-II","optimization criteria","input quantity","filter performance","Pareto optimal solutions","La Sevillana establishment","Balnearia","Cordoba","Argentina"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Networks","Rainfall Forecast","Gaussian Process","Hurst's parameter","Bayesian inference"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a Gaussian process and feed-forward neural networks based filter for forecasting short rainfall time series","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706741/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027426","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a Gaussian process and feed-forward neural networks based filter for forecasting short rainfall time series","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P034.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077351S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6706745,"authors":[{"name":"Innocent Sizo Duma","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Science, University of Johannesburg, B2 Lab 212"],"firstName":"Innocent Sizo","lastName":"Duma","id":"37086648560"},{"name":"Bhekisipho Twala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Science, University of Johannesburg"],"firstName":"Bhekisipho","lastName":"Twala","id":"37395921400"},{"name":"Tshilidzi Marwala","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, University of Johannesburg"],"firstName":"Tshilidzi","lastName":"Marwala","id":"37302936200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6706745","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706745","abstract":"In this study we propose a multilayered feedforward neural network (MFNN) with Bayesian Regularization, and apply it to the credit risk evaluation problem domain using a real world data set from a financial services company in England.

First, we developed repeatedly-used abstractions that span neural codes (such as binary, rate, population, and time-to-spike), long-range connectivity, and short-range connectivity. Second, we implemented ten algorithms that include convolution networks, spectral content estimators, liquid state machines, restricted Boltzmann machines, hidden Markov models, looming detection, temporal pattern matching, and various classifiers. Third, we demonstrate seven applications that include speaker recognition, music composer recognition, digit recognition, sequence prediction, collision avoidance, optical flow, and eye detection.

We adopt a measure to conduct the degree of melodiousness (Euler's gradus suavitatis) of the output melody, which is compared with a reference value. Varying a specific parameter of the chaotic system, we can control the complexity of the chaotic melody. The system runs until the degree of melodiousness falls within a predetermined range.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706747","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706747.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Computer-aided music composition with LSTM neural network and chaotic inspiration","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027212","htmlLink":"/document/6706747/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-aided music composition with LSTM neural network and chaotic inspiration","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054999S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6706748,"authors":[{"name":"Deli Pei","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Deli","lastName":"Pei","id":"38547907300"},{"name":"Huaping Liu","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huaping","lastName":"Liu","id":"37310126400"},{"name":"Yulong Liu","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yulong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086797508"},{"name":"Fuchun Sun","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fuchun","lastName":"Sun","id":"37279269000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6706748","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":395},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Image segmentation","Semantics","Training","Vectors","Correlation","Cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image segmentation","optimisation","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised multimodal feature learning","semantic image segmentation","single-layer networks","RGB image","depth image","L2,1 optimization","intrinsic correlation","public NYU dataset","classification performance","dictionary learning","robot platforms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706748","abstract":"In this paper, we address the semantic segmentation problem using single-layer networks.

In this paper, a hybrid ELM and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach is presented to optimize the input weights and hidden biases for ELM, which also use the concepts of Clustering Analysis. Two different treatments are presented for the particles that fly out the search space bounds.

Therefore, a novel time-based NDP scheme is developed in this paper to solve finite horizon optimal control of NNCS. First, an online neural network (NN) identifier is introduced to approximate the control coefficient matrix. Then, the critic and action NNs are utilized to determine time-based finite horizon stochastic optimal control for NNCS in a forward-in-time manner. By incorporating novel NN weight update laws, Lyapunov theory is used to show that all closed-loop signals and NN weights are uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) with ultimate bounds being a function of initial conditions and final time. Moreover, the approximated control input converges close to target value within finite time. Simulation results are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706754.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based finite horizon stochastic optimal controller design for nonlinear networked control systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706754/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6706754/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based finite horizon stochastic optimal controller design for nonlinear networked control systems","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027283","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based finite horizon stochastic optimal controller design for nonlinear networked control systems","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052682S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706754","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6706756,"authors":[{"name":"Piotr Suszy\u0144ski","affiliation":["Institute of Control and Computation Engineering, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland"],"firstName":"Piotr","lastName":"Suszy\u0144ski","id":"37086708663"},{"name":"Pawe\u0142 Wawrzy\u0144ski","affiliation":["Institute of Control and Computation Engineering, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland"],"firstName":"Pawe\u0142","lastName":"Wawrzy\u0144ski","id":"37938267000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6706756","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Encoding","Sociology","Statistics","Biological neural networks","Gaussian distribution","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","perturbation techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning population","spiking neural networks","synaptic conductances perturbation","perturbations autocorrelation","learning tasks","spike timing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spiking neural networks","learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706756","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706756","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","abstract":"In this paper a method is presented for learning of spiking neural networks.

Adaptation at different levels - ranging from the physical level to the system level-can be combined to develop efficient solutions by means of FPGA technology. In this work, a multilevel adaptation scheme for the development of intelligent agents is proposed. Software learning algorithms are applied to adapt the agent behavior (i.e. neural network parameters) at the system level, while dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) is used to modify the agent at the physical and architectural level (i.e. neural network topology). Firstly, a multilevel adaptive intelligent agent is able to manage its resources efficiently in order to meet time-varying demands such as speed performance and power consumption. Secondly, from the behavioral viewpoint, multilevel adaptation provides the intelligent agent with high plasticity and flexibility. An FPGA-based intelligent agent has been successfully deployed for a real-time control problem in an inhabited intelligent environment. Results obtained show that the agent is able to adapt itself to changes in the environment in a lifelong mode.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706760","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706760.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilevel adaptive neural network architecture for implementing single-chip intelligent agents on FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706760/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multilevel adaptive neural network architecture for implementing single-chip intelligent agents on FPGAs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706760/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14027194","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel adaptive neural network architecture for implementing single-chip intelligent agents on FPGAs","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129011S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6706762,"authors":[{"name":"Syed A.

Due to the general operating environment, there exists a non-linear relationship between the input and output data gathered from these sensors. Moreover, the transmission of data from such dynamic environments is generally marred by a large SNR with substantial level of \u201cfalse-noise\u201d belonging to the normal movement pattern of the mechanical parts. Within this context, the goal of this paper is to explore, evaluate and develop an optimal, dynamic neural network to improve the fault prediction accuracy of condition monitoring systems. The training data for this research was obtained from a vibration and a thermal sensor connected mounted over a polyphase induction motor. The objective was to identify any anomalies in the motor's fan-based cooling system. Moreover, the model presented a comparative analysis of a dynamic neural network (DNN) model against a non-linear autoregressive neural system (NARX) with exogenous input. The validation outcome presented a close regressive relationship of 0.9734 between observed and targeted outcomes over a 7-second delay with a NARX model giving a 4.56% and 5.23% classification accuracy. The best model system was evaluated against unseen anomaly data and demonstrated high prediction accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706762/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14027164","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706762/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Application of dynamic neural networks with exogenous input to industrial conditional monitoring","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of dynamic neural networks with exogenous input to industrial conditional monitoring","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110193S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6706763,"authors":[{"name":"Saed Hussain","affiliation":["School of Computing Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), Preston, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Saed","lastName":"Hussain","id":"37085403351"},{"name":"Maizura Mokhtar","affiliation":["School of Computing Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire (UCLan), Preston, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Maizura","lastName":"Mokhtar","id":"38498763000"},{"name":"Joe M.

The neuron by neuron (NBN) learning algorithm, which is an improved version of the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm, is combined with the fully connected cascade (FCC) neural network architecture to estimate an aircraft's sensor measurements. Compared to other neural networks and learning algorithms, this combination can produce good sensor estimates with relatively few neurons.

Accurate drift detections allow prompt reaction to drifts and help to maintain high performance of online models over time. Although many methods have been proposed, no attention has been given to data streams with imbalanced class distributions, which commonly exist in real-world applications, such as fault diagnosis of control systems and intrusion detection in computer networks. This paper studies the concept drift problem for online class imbalance learning. We look into the impact of concept drift on single-class performance of online models based on three types of classifiers, under seven different scenarios with the presence of class imbalance. The analysis reveals that detecting drift in imbalanced data streams is a more difficult task than in balanced ones. Minority-class recall suffers from a significant drop after the drift involving the minority class. Overall accuracy is not suitable for drift detection. Based on the findings, we propose a new detection method DDM-OCI derived from the existing method DDM. DDM-OCI monitors minority-class recall online to capture the drift. The results show a quick response of the online model working with DDM-OCI to the new concept.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706768/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706768/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14027353","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Concept drift detection for online class imbalance learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concept drift detection for online class imbalance learning","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P061.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102267S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706768","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6706773,"authors":[{"name":"Chris Yakopcic","affiliation":["University of Dayton, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Yakopcic","id":"37888554000"},{"name":"Tarek M.

This architecture, referred to as a Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (RQNN) can characterize a non-stationary stochastic signal as time varying wave packets. An unsupervised learning rule allows the RQNN to capture the statistical behaviour of the input signal and facilitates estimation of an EMG signal embedded in noise with unknown characteristics. Results from a number of benchmark tests show that simple signals such as DC, staircase DC and sinusoidal signals embedded with a high level of noise can be accurately filtered. Particle swarm optimization is employed to select RQNN model parameters for filtering simple signals. In this paper, we present the RQNN filtering procedure, using heuristically selected parameters, to be applied to a new thirteen class EMG based finger movement detection system, for emulation in a Shadow Robotics robot hand. It is shown that the RQNN EMG filtering improves the classification performance compared to using only the raw EMG signals, across multiple feature extraction approaches and subjects. Effective control of the robot hand is demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706781","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706781.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum neural network based surface EMG signal filtering for control of robotic hand","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Quantum neural network based surface EMG signal filtering for control of robotic hand","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14027296","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6706781/","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum neural network based surface EMG signal filtering for control of robotic hand","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107591S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6706782,"authors":[{"name":"Ken Saito","affiliation":["Department of Precision Machinery Engineering, Nihon University, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Ken","lastName":"Saito","id":"37891501100"},{"name":"Shiho Takahama","affiliation":["Precision Machinery Engineering, Nihon University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shiho","lastName":"Takahama","id":"38232609900"},{"name":"Shinpei Yamasaki","affiliation":["Precision Machinery Engineering, Nihon University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinpei","lastName":"Yamasaki","id":"37086706449"},{"name":"Minami Takato","affiliation":["Precision Machinery Engineering, Nihon University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Minami","lastName":"Takato","id":"38241845600"},{"name":"Yoshifumi Sekine","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Science, Nihon University, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshifumi","lastName":"Sekine","id":"37346983700"},{"name":"Fumio Uchikoba","affiliation":["Department of Precision Machinery Engineering, Nihon University, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumio","lastName":"Uchikoba","id":"37620167300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6706782","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706782","abstract":"This paper present the integrated circuit (IC) chip of pulse-type hardware neural networks (P-HNN) which can generate the driving waveform of hexapod walking micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) micro robot. The driving waveform of micro robot is oscillatory waveform of electrical activity such as living organisms. Basic components of the P-HNN are the cell body model and inhibitory synaptic model. The cell body model and inhibitory synaptic model has the same basic features of biological neurons such as threshold, refractory period, spatio-temporal summation characteristics and enables the generation of continuous action potentials. P-HNN was constructed by metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET), can be integrated by IC production lines. P-HNN output the driving waveform using synchronization phenomena such as biological neural networks. Four output signal ports were extracted from P-HNN and they were connected to the actuators. The driving pulses can operate the actuators of MEMS micro robot directly. Therefore, P-HNN realized the robot control without using any software programs or A/D converters. The size of the micro robot fabricate by the MEMS technology is 4.0 (mm) \u00d7 2.7 (mm) \u00d7 2.5 (mm), width, length, height size. The frame of the robot is made of silicon wafer, equipped with the rotary type actuators, the link mechanisms and 6 legs. The MEMS micro robot emulates the hexapod walking method and the neural networks of the insect by the rotary type actuators, link mechanisms and IC chip of P-HNN. As a result, we show that IC chip of P-HNN can control the hexapod walking of fabricated MEMS micro robot, and also switched the direction by inputting the external trigger pulse.

It consists of an artificial neural network with three neuron layers (input, middle and output) that are connected by feedback connections between the output and middle layer, on top of feedforward connections from the input to middle and middle to output layers. Learning is accomplished by the model following the Hebb principle, dictating that \u201ccells that fire together, wire together\u201d, with some important alterations, compared to standard Hebbian learning, in order to prevent the model from forgetting previously learned patterns, when learning new ones. In addition, short-term memory is introduced into the model in order to facilitate and guide learning of neuronal synapses (long-term memory). As auditory attention is an essential part of human auditory scene analysis (ASA), it is also indispensable in any computational model mimicking it, and it is shown that different auditory attention mechanism naturally emerge from the neuronal behaviour as implemented in the model described in this paper. The learning behavior of the model is further investigated in the context of an urban sonic environment, and the importance of short-term memory in this process is demonstrated. Finally, the effectiveness of the model is evaluated by comparing model output on presented sound recordings to a human expert listeners evaluation of the same fragments.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706791","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706791.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A biologically inspired recurrent neural network for sound source recognition incorporating auditory attention","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Brain modeling","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Training","Hebbian theory","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hebbian learning","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biologically inspired recurrent neural network","sound source recognition","auditory attention","human-mimicking model","artificial neural network","feedback connections","feedforward connections","standard Hebbian learning","short-term memory","neuronal synapses","human auditory scene analysis","ASA","urban sonic environment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706791/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A biologically inspired recurrent neural network for sound source recognition incorporating auditory attention","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706791/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027482","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A biologically inspired recurrent neural network for sound source recognition incorporating auditory attention","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050948S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":6706803,"authors":[{"name":"Gangyi Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Gangyi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086741180"},{"name":"Guanghui Ren","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Guanghui","lastName":"Ren","id":"37293260100"},{"name":"Zhilu Wu","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Zhilu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37291499600"},{"name":"Yaqin Zhao","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Yaqin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37983762000"},{"name":"Lihui Jiang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Lihui","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086741204"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6706803","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":480},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Support vector machines","Accuracy","Image color analysis","Image edge detection","Training","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","support vector machines","traffic information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical method","traffic sign classification","support vector machines","driver assistance systems","German traffic sign recognition benchmark","GTSRB","realtime applications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706803","abstract":"Traffic sign classification is an important function for driver assistance systems.

Various algorithms have been proposed, and advanced driver assistance systems supporting detection and recognition of traffic signs have reached the market. Despite the many competing approaches, there is no clear consensus on what the state-of-the-art in this field is. This can be accounted to the lack of comprehensive, unbiased comparisons of those methods. We aim at closing this gap by the \u201cGerman Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark\u201d presented as a competition at IJCNN 2013 (International Joint Conference on Neural Networks). We introduce a real-world benchmark data set for traffic sign detection together with carefully chosen evaluation metrics, baseline results, and a web-interface for comparing approaches. In our evaluation, we separate sign detection from classification, but still measure the performance on relevant categories of signs to allow for benchmarking specialized solutions. The considered baseline algorithms represent some of the most popular detection approaches such as the Viola-Jones detector based on Haar features and a linear classifier relying on HOG descriptors.

Finally, we present provisional positive conclusions.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706823","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706823.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach to three ensemble neural network rule extraction using recursive-rule extraction algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706823/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new approach to three ensemble neural network rule extraction using recursive-rule extraction algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706823/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14027456","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach to three ensemble neural network rule extraction using recursive-rule extraction algorithm","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061282S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":6706826,"authors":[{"name":"Farhan Dawood","affiliation":["Department of Artificial Intelligence, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Farhan","lastName":"Dawood","id":"37085382653"},{"name":"Chu Kiong Loo","affiliation":["Department of Artificial Intelligence, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Chu Kiong","lastName":"Loo","id":"37282491700"},{"name":"Wei Hong Chin","affiliation":["Department of Artificial Intelligence, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Wei Hong","lastName":"Chin","id":"37085658939"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6706826","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Adaptation models","Neurons","Subspace constraints","Covariance matrices","Joints","Robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ART neural nets","gait analysis","Gaussian processes","graph theory","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion capturing","graph node","GART","Gaussian adaptive resonance theory","topology-learning mechanism","human motion pattern encoding","TGART-HMM","topological Gaussian adaptive resonance hidden Markov model","continuous motion observation","incremental online learning"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present an approach for on-line and incremental learning of human motion patterns through continuous observation of motion using novel Topological Gaussian Adaptive Resonance Hidden Markov Model (TGART-HMM). The observed human motion patterns are encoded in a novel modified version of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) called TGART-HMM. The on-line learning process consists of updating the structure of Hidden Markov Model using a topology-learning mechanism based on Gaussian Adaptive Resonance Theory (GART). The model size is adaptable based on the observed motion patterns. The resulting HMM structure is a graph where each node represents an encoded motion pattern. The parameters of TGART-HMM are updated incrementally to incorporate incessant motion patterns.

An example of its application is the location of sounds by barn owls that requires especially precise temporal coding. Dependent upon the azimuthal angle, the arrival times of sound signals are shifted between both ears. In order to determine these interaural time differences, the phase difference of the signals is measured. We implemented this biologically inspired network on a neuromorphic hardware system and demonstrate spike-timing dependent plasticity on an analog, highly accelerated hardware substrate. Our neuromorphic implementation enables the resolution of time differences of less than 50 ns. On-chip Hebbian learning mechanisms select inputs from a pool of neurons which code for the same sound frequency. Hence, noise caused by different synaptic delays across these inputs is reduced. Furthermore, learning compensates for variations on neuronal and synaptic parameters caused by device mismatch intrinsic to the neuromorphic substrate.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706828","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706828.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuromorphic learning towards nano second precision","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Neuromorphic learning towards nano second precision","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706828/","accessionNumber":"14027305","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706828/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuromorphic learning towards nano second precision","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065466S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":6706831,"authors":[{"name":"Kyung Hyun Cho","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Kyung Hyun","lastName":"Cho","id":"37067919700"},{"name":"Tapani Raiko","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Tapani","lastName":"Raiko","id":"37564370700"},{"name":"Alexander Ilin","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computer Science, Aalto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Ilin","id":"37548329400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6706831","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1390},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Training","Approximation methods","Adaptation models","Computational modeling","Data models","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boltzmann machines","Gaussian processes","gradient methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian-Bernoulli deep Boltzmann machine","GDBM","Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine","GRBM","multiple layers","binary hidden neurons","learning algorithm","parallel tempering","enhanced gradient","adaptive learning rate","layer-wise pretraining","deep Boltzmann machines","learning rate scheduling"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study a model that we call Gaussian-Bernoulli deep Boltzmann machine (GDBM) and discuss potential improvements in training the model.

The results showed that the combined PSF-NN approach provides accurate predictions, outperforming the original PSF algorithm and a number of baselines.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706838","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706838.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining pattern sequence similarity with neural networks for forecasting electricity demand time series","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Combining pattern sequence similarity with neural networks for forecasting electricity demand time series","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14027472","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6706838/","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining pattern sequence similarity with neural networks for forecasting electricity demand time series","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077211S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6706839,"authors":[{"name":"Mashud Rana","affiliation":["School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Mashud","lastName":"Rana","id":"37398280500"},{"name":"Irena Koprinska","affiliation":["School of Information Technologies, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Irena","lastName":"Koprinska","id":"37332859800"},{"name":"Abbas Khosravi","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent Systems Research, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Khosravi","id":"37407922100"},{"name":"Vassilios G.

The discrete k-valued MVN activation function divides a complex plane into k equal sectors. To be able to get more reliable and efficient solutions for various classification problems, it is possible to modify the MLMVN error-correction learning rule in such a way that the learning samples belonging to different classes (clusters) will be concentrated along the bisector of a desired sector (the cluster center) and at the same time will be located as far as possible from each other. Such a modification based on soft margins learning, which is reduced to the minimization of the angular distance between the bisector of a desired sector and a weighted sum, is considered in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706842","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706842.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modified error-correction learning rule for multilayer neural network with multi-valued neurons","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Backpropagation","Feedforward neural networks","Nonhomogeneous media","Classification algorithms","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction","learning (artificial intelligence)","multilayer perceptrons","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer neural network with multi-valued neurons","standard feedforward organization","derivative-free learning algorithm","discrete k-valued MVN activation function","MLMVN error-correction learning rule","learning samples","soft margins learning","angular distance minimization","weighted sum","bisector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A modified error-correction learning rule for multilayer neural network with multi-valued neurons","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706842/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027216","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modified error-correction learning rule for multilayer neural network with multi-valued neurons","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069468S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6706854,"authors":[{"name":"Rakesh Chalasani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Rakesh","lastName":"Chalasani","id":"37886199700"},{"name":"Jose C.

mobile robot based on multi-layer neural network on homogeneous architecture","abstract":"Today, the problem of designing suitable multiprocessor architecture tailored for a target Neural Networks applications raises the need for a fast and efficient MP-SOC (MultiProcessor System-on-Chip) design environment. Additionally, the implementation of such applications on multiprocessor designs will need to exploit the parallelism and pipelining in algorithms with the hope of delivering significant reduction in execution times. To take advantage of parallelization on homogeneous multiprocessor architecture and to reduce the programming effort, we provide new MP-SOC design methodology which offers more opportunities for accelerating the parallelization of Neural Networks algorithms. The efficiency of this approach is tested on many examples of applications. This work is devoted to the design and implementation of a complete intelligent controller parking system of autonomous mobile robot based on Multi-Layer Feed-Forward Neural Networks. To emphasize some specific requirements to be considered when implementing such algorithm, we propose new parallel pipelined architecture composed of several computational stages. Additionally, we especially suggest a parallel software skeleton \u201cSCComCM\u201d aimed at being employed by the developed multistage architecture. The experimental results show that the proposed parallel architecture has better speed-up, less communication time, and better space reduction factor than the hand tuned hardware design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706922/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14027257","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706922/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast parking control of mobile robot based on multi-layer neural network on homogeneous architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast parking control of mobile robot based on multi-layer neural network on homogeneous architecture","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051109S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6706923,"authors":[{"name":"Chin Hiong Tan","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Chin Hiong","lastName":"Tan","id":"38183667200"},{"name":"Huajin Tang","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Huajin","lastName":"Tang","id":"37274558400"},{"name":"Eng Yeow Cheu","affiliation":["Agency for Science Technology and Research, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Eng Yeow","lastName":"Cheu","id":"37694714400"},{"name":"Jun Hu","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Hu","id":"37075077200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6706923","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Hippocampus","Computational modeling","Associative memory","Kernel","Mathematical model","Oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient associative memory model","hippocampus","spiking neurons","short term associative memories","auto associative memory","spiking neural network","memory items","gamma subcycles","synaptic modifications","recurrent collaterals","fast NMDA channels","deactivation time","spike response model","SRM","computational efficiency","integrate and fire neuron model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706923","abstract":"The hippocampus is involved with the storage and retrieval of short-term associative memories.

The spiking neural network encodes different associative memories by different subsets of the principal neurons. These memory items are activated in different gamma subcycles, and auto-associative memory is maintained by the synaptic modifications of recurrent collaterals by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) channels. Accurate formation of auto-associative memory is achievable in single presentation of memory items when synaptic modifications depend on fast NMDA channels having a deactivation time within the duration of a gamma subcycle.

However, because of the high nonlinearity, the traditional modeling and implementation approaches have difficulties in terms of generalization ability (i.e., performance on reproducing an unknown data) and computational resources. To overcome these difficulties, asynchronous cellular automaton based neuron models has been presented, which are neuron models described as special kinds of cellular automata and can be implemented as small asynchronous sequential logic circuits. This paper presents a novel network of such models, which can mimic input-output relationships of biological and nonlinear ODE model neural networks. Computer simulations confirm that the presented network has a higher generalization ability than another modeling and implementation approach. In addition, brief comparisons of the computational resources for execution and learning shows that the presented network requires less computational resources.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel reservoir network of asynchronous cellular automaton based neurons for MIMO neural system reproduction","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706926","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706926.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706926","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706926/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A novel reservoir network of asynchronous cellular automaton based neurons for MIMO neural system reproduction","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706926/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027187","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel reservoir network of asynchronous cellular automaton based neurons for MIMO neural system reproduction","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078423S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6706927,"authors":[{"name":"Evangelos Stromatias","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Evangelos","lastName":"Stromatias","id":"37085562979"},{"name":"Francesco Galluppi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Galluppi","id":"37888482700"},{"name":"Cameron Patterson","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Cameron","lastName":"Patterson","id":"38467290000"},{"name":"Steve Furber","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Furber","id":"37267185200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6706927","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":632},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Computational modeling","Mathematical model","Biological system modeling","Sociology","Statistics","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","neural chips","neural net architecture","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power analysis","large-scale real-time neural networks","spiking neural networks","SpiNNaker neuromimetic architecture","large-scale heterogeneous models","spiking neurons","power efficiency","48-chip board","SpiNNaker power estimation model","firing rates","synaptic events","SpiNNaker chip","application-specific integrated circuit"]}],"abstract":"Simulating large spiking neural networks is non trivial: supercomputers offer great flexibility at the price of power and communication overheads; custom neuromorphic circuits are more power efficient but less flexible; while alternative approaches based on GPGPUs and FPGAs, whilst being more readily available, show similar model specialization. As well as efficiency and flexibility, real time simulation is a desirable neural network characteristic, for example in cognitive robotics where embodied agents interact with the environment using low-power, event-based neuromorphic sensors. The SpiNNaker neuromimetic architecture has been designed to address these requirements, simulating large-scale heterogeneous models of spiking neurons in real-time, offering a unique combination of flexibility, scalability and power efficiency. In this work a 48-chip board is utilised to generate a SpiNNaker power estimation model, based on numbers of neurons, synapses and their firing rates. In addition, we demonstrate simulations capable of handling up to a quarter of a million neurons, 81 million synapses and 1.8 billion synaptic events per second, with the most complex simulations consuming less than 1 Watt per SpiNNaker chip.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power analysis of large-scale, real-time neural networks on SpiNNaker","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706927","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706927.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Power analysis of large-scale, real-time neural networks on SpiNNaker","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706927/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027297","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power analysis of large-scale, real-time neural networks on SpiNNaker","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089009S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706927","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6706928,"authors":[{"name":"Shaista Hussain","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shaista","lastName":"Hussain","id":"38547290100"},{"name":"Roshan Gopalakrishnan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Roshan","lastName":"Gopalakrishnan","id":"37085583471"},{"name":"Arindam Basu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Arindam","lastName":"Basu","id":"37272835500"},{"name":"Shih-Chii Liu","affiliation":["Institute of Neuroinformatics, ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Shih-Chii","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280142900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6706928","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Morphology","Training","Hardware","Correlation","Computational modeling","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory capacity","dendritic branch activations","nonlinear dendrites","linearly summing cells","neuron model","binary weights","pattern classification task","address-event representation","off-chip memory","spiking neural networks","AER based reconfiguration","binary synapses","neuromorphic systems","morphological learning"]}],"abstract":"Spiking neurons with lumped nonlinearity representing active dendrites can perform a larger number of input-output mappings than is possible by a neuron with linear synaptic summation of its currents. This is possible due to the additional degree of freedom in such cells-its `morphology' reflected in the number of dendrites and the choice of which inputs form synapses on the same dendrite. We present a hardware friendly algorithm for learning such optimal morphologies utilizing correlations between inputs and dendritic branch activations. We demonstrate the increased memory capacity of neurons with nonlinear dendrites and binary synapses over typically used linearly summing cells with high resolution weights. We have shown that a neuron model with a fixed number of binary weights performs much worse on a pattern classification task when it uses traditional linear dendrites than when it utilizes nonlinear dendrites (19% compared to 9% errors for 1000 patterns). This method allows to trade-off weight resolution, a problem in most current neuromorphic systems, with configurability that is the strength of address event representation (AER) based systems which can store configuration details in an off-chip memory. On a fundamental level, it points to the need of having a higher ratio of nonlinear to linear operations in spiking neural networks than is typically used.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706928","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706928.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Morphological learning: Increased memory capacity of neuromorphic systems with binary synapses exploiting AER based reconfiguration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Morphological learning: Increased memory capacity of neuromorphic systems with binary synapses exploiting AER based reconfiguration","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706928/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027232","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6706928/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Morphological learning: Increased memory capacity of neuromorphic systems with binary synapses exploiting AER based reconfiguration","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062839S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706928","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6706929,"authors":[{"name":"Sivalogeswaran Ratnasingam","affiliation":["National ICT Australia (NICTA), Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Sivalogeswaran","lastName":"Ratnasingam","id":"37705924200"},{"name":"Antonio Robles-Kelly","affiliation":["National ICT Australia (NICTA), Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Robles-Kelly","id":"38270627800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6706929","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Neurons","Neural networks","Visualization","Encoding","Standards","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image colour analysis","neural nets","object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["illuminant-invariant colour discrimination","biologically inspired spiking neural network","neural mechanisms","visual stimulus processing","cone photo receptors","centre-surround receptive fields","retinal ganglion cells","striate cortex","inhibitory lateral synaptic connections","excitatory synaptic connections","spike-timing dependent plasticity","STDP","long term potentiation and depression","LTP/LTD","feed-forward leaky integrate-and-fire spiking neural network","Munsell spectra dataset","colour-based object recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706929","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706929","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a biologically inspired spiking neural network approach to obtaining an opponent pair which is invariant to illumination variations and can be employed for colour discrimination.

Such method obtains the synaptic weights of a PCNN that implements any totalistic cellular automata behavior, dispensing the usage of heuristic methods such as genetic algorithms or numerical approaches such as quadratic programming procedures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706950/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14027114","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706950/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A root location training method for polynomial cellular neural networks that implements totalistic cellular automata","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A root location training method for polynomial cellular neural networks that implements totalistic cellular automata","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077746S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6706951,"authors":[{"name":"Narutoshi Horimoto","affiliation":["EE Department, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Narutoshi","lastName":"Horimoto","id":"37086657009"},{"name":"Toshimichi Saito","affiliation":["EE Department, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Toshimichi","lastName":"Saito","id":"37275146800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6706951","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transient analysis","Lattices","Steady-state","Neurons","Nickel","Stability analysis","Concrete"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","neurophysiology","transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital spike systems","spike-train dynamics classification","spike-position transition concentricity","one-dimensional lattice points","digital dynamical system","transient-state spike-trains","steady-state spike-trains","simple digital spike maps","coexisting periodic spike-trains","transient phenomena analysis"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies various transient- and steady-state spike-trains generated by the digital spike map: a simple digital dynamical system from a set of one-dimensional lattice points to itself.

We propose a model for homeostatic synaptic scaling that modifies synaptic weights in a multiplicative manner based on the average postsynaptic firing rate as observed in experiments. The homeostatic mechanism was implemented with STDP in conductance-based SNNs with Izhikevich-type neurons. In the first set of simulations, homeostatic synaptic scaling stabilized weight changes in STDP and prevented runaway dynamics in simple SNNs. During the second set of simulations, homeostatic synaptic scaling was found to be necessary for the unsupervised learning of V1 simple cell receptive fields in response to patterned inputs. STDP, in combination with homeostatic synaptic scaling, was shown to be mathematically equivalent to non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) and the stability of the homeostatic update rule was proven. The homeostatic model presented here is novel, biologically plausible, and capable of unsupervised learning of patterned inputs, which has been a significant challenge for SNNs with STDP.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biologically plausible models of homeostasis and STDP: Stability and learning in spiking neural networks","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706961","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706961.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","startPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706961","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Firing","Tuning","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Gratings","Sociology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","matrix decomposition","medical signal processing","neural nets","neurophysiology","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biologically plausible models","homeostasis","STDP","spiking neural network simulation","spike-timing dependent plasticity","regulatory mechanism","homeostatic synaptic scaling","average postsynaptic firing","conductance-based SNN","Izhikevich-type neurons","unsupervised learning","nonnegative matrix factorization","homeostatic update rule","Hebbian learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Biologically plausible models of homeostasis and STDP: Stability and learning in spiking neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706961/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14027447","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biologically plausible models of homeostasis and STDP: Stability and learning in spiking neural networks","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083483S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-08"},{"_id":6706962,"authors":[{"name":"Sergio Davies","affiliation":["Advanced Processor Technologies Group, The University of Manchester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Davies","id":"37545294200"},{"name":"Terry Stewart","affiliation":["Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience, University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Terry","lastName":"Stewart","id":"38466979000"},{"name":"Chris Eliasmith","affiliation":["Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience, University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Eliasmith","id":"38467066400"},{"name":"Steve Furber","affiliation":["Advanced Processor Technologies Group, The University of Manchester, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Furber","id":"37267185200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6706962","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sociology","Statistics","Neurons","Decoding","Biological neural networks","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural chips","neural net architecture","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spike-based learning","transfer functions","SpiNNaker neuromimetic simulator","large scale neural network models","real-time simulations","SpiNNaker neuromimetic architecture","learning rule","SpiNNaker system","neural engineering framework","NEF","supervised framework","prescribed error sensitivity","PES class","nonlinear functions","spiking neural network architecture"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spike-based learning of transfer functions with the SpiNNaker neuromimetic simulator","abstract":"Recent papers have shown the possibility to implement large scale neural network models that perform complex algorithms in a biologically realistic way.

We show that the proposed learning rule, belonging to the Prescribed Error Sensitivity (PES) class, is able to learn, effectively, both linear and non-linear functions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706962","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706962","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706962.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706962/","displayDocTitle":"Spike-based learning of transfer functions with the SpiNNaker neuromimetic simulator","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14027220","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6706962/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spike-based learning of transfer functions with the SpiNNaker neuromimetic simulator","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068339S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6706964,"authors":[{"name":"D.

BCESNN is a two-layered neuron model with afferent neurons in the input layer and efferent neurons in the output layer. The afferent neurons in the input layer convert the real-valued input feature to a train of spikes using a bank of Gaussian Receptive Field (GRF) for each individual feature. The number of GRF per feature is fixed a priori. Each efferent neuron in the output layer is associated to a class. Efferent neurons are integrate-and-fire type neuron. BCESNN has an evolving architecture that uses basis coupled rank order learning (BCROL) algorithm to estimate the number of output neurons and the network parameters. Each sample is presented only once to the network. When a new sample is presented to the network either we add a neuron or we update an existing neuron. Weight estimation for added neuron is done using BCROL and weight update is done using Euclidean distance based distance measure. In the performance section we conducted three different experiments. Firstly we compared the performance of BCROL against Rank Order Learning(ROL). Next, we evaluated the performance of BCESNN on benchmark classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository. Finally, we evaluated the performance of a sparsely connected BCESNN against fully connected BCESNN where connectivity refers to the number of GRF connected to the afferent neurons.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706964","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706964.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706964","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706964","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706964/","displayDocTitle":"A basis coupled evolving spiking neural network with afferent input neurons","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027208","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706964/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A basis coupled evolving spiking neural network with afferent input neurons","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066622S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6706965,"authors":[{"name":"Scott McDonald","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Research Centre, University of Ulster, Magee, Northern Ireland, U.K."],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"McDonald","id":"37085549926"},{"name":"Sonya Coleman","affiliation":["Intelligent Systems Research Centre, University of Ulster, Magee, Northern Ireland, U.K."],"firstName":"Sonya","lastName":"Coleman","id":"37269140600"},{"name":"T.

With sufficient training data, this leads to very competitive results for visual recognition tasks when starting from a random initialization. When the amount of labeled data is limited, CNNs reveal their strong dependence on large amounts of training data. However, recent results have shown that a well chosen optimization starting point can be beneficial for convergence to a good generalizing minimum. This starting point was mostly found using unsupervised feature learning techniques such as sparse coding or transfer learning from related recognition tasks. In this work, we compare these two approaches against a simple patch based initialization scheme and a random initialization of the weights.

In recent years, the imbalanced data learning problem has drawn significant interest. In this work, we focus on designing modifications to neural network, in order to appropriately tackle the problem of multiclass imbalance. We propose a method that combines two ideas: diverse random subspace ensemble learning with evolutionary search, to improve the performance of neural network on multiclass imbalanced data. An evolutionary search technique is utilized to optimize the misclassification cost under the guidance of imbalanced data measures. Moreover, the diverse random subspace ensemble employs the minimum overlapping mechanism to provide diversity so as to improve the performance of the learning and optimization of neural network. Furthermore, the ensemble framework can determine the optimal amount of non-redundant components automatically. We have demonstrated experimentally using UCI datasets that our approach can achieve significantly better result than state-of-the-art methods for imbalanced data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6706980/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14027137","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6706980/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel cost sensitive neural network ensemble for multiclass imbalance data learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel cost sensitive neural network ensemble for multiclass imbalance data learning","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073808S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6706980","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6706986,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Yuan Chiu","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent and Networked Systems, Central Queensland University"],"firstName":"Chien-Yuan","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37085515199"},{"name":"Brijesh Verma","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent and Networked Systems, Central Queensland University"],"firstName":"Brijesh","lastName":"Verma","id":"37330093200"},{"name":"Michael Li","affiliation":["Centre for Intelligent and Networked Systems, Central Queensland University"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Li","id":"38466991200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6706986","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6706986","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Training","Neural networks","Boosting","Diversity reception","Bagging","Computer aided software engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classification tasks","prediction tasks","ensemble classifier generation techniques","neural network based techniques","data variables","UCI machine learning benchmark datasets","neural network ensemble classifiers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706986","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06706986.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706986","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of variability in data on accuracy and diversity of neural network based ensemble classifiers","abstract":"Ensemble classifiers are very useful tools which can be applied for classification and prediction tasks in many real-world applications.

The network is derived to ensure that a unique equilibrium state can be achieved to overcome the known stability and convergence problems. Extensive simulations for multi-step prediction in stationary and non-stationary time series were performed. The resulting projection made by the proposed network shows substantial profits on financial historical signals when compared to other neural network approaches.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) constitutes an option for systems whose mathematical description is uncertain or partially unknown. In this paper, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is designed to address the problems of identification and control of discrete-time nonlinear systems given by a gray box. The learning laws for the RNN are designed in terms of discrete-time Lyapunov stability. The control input is developed fulfilling the existence condition to establish a Quasi Sliding Regime. In means of Lyapunov stability, the identification and tracking errors are ultimately bounded in a neighborhood around zero. Numerical examples are presented to show the behavior of the RNN in the identification and control processes of a highly nonlinear discrete-time system, a Lorentz chaotic

Load forecasting plays an significant role in determining the future load requirements as well as the growth in the electricity demand, which is essential for the proper development of electricity infrastructure. The newly developed neuroevolutionary technique called Recurrent Cartesian Genetic Programming evolved Artificial Neural Networks (RCGPANN) has been used to develop a peak load forecasting model that can predict load patterns for a complete year as well as for various seasons in advance.

In this paper, we propose a fault detection and diagnosis system to detect and classify broken rotor bars and eccentricity faults of induction motors using the Fuzzy MinMax (FMM) neural network. A series of real experiments is conducted, where the acquired current signals under various motor conditions is used to build a database. The Power Spectral Density is then used to extract the discriminative input features for fault detection and classification with FMM. The results are comparable, if not better, than those from the MultiLayer Perceptron neural network and other methods reported in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707003","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06707003.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and diagnosis of broken rotor bars and eccentricity faults in induction motors using the Fuzzy Min-Max neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707003/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detection and diagnosis of broken rotor bars and eccentricity faults in induction motors using the Fuzzy Min-Max neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707003/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14027184","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and diagnosis of broken rotor bars and eccentricity faults in induction motors using the Fuzzy Min-Max neural network","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P296.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.153744S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6707003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6707004,"authors":[{"name":"Islam El-Nabarawy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, American University in Cairo, Egypt"],"firstName":"Islam","lastName":"El-Nabarawy","id":"37086761585"},{"name":"Ashraf M.

A variety of approaches have been proposed to build a classifier based on classification rules. In the prediction stage of the extant approaches, most of the existing association classifiers use the ensemble quality measurement of each rule in a subset of rules to predict the class label of the new data. This method still suffers the following two problems. The classification rules are used individually thus the coupling relations between rules [1] are ignored in the prediction. However, in real-world rule set, rules are often inter-related and a new data object may partially satisfy many rules. Furthermore, the classification rule based prediction model lacks a general expression of the decision methodology. This paper proposes a classification method that integrating classification rules into neural network (CRNN, for short), which presents a general form of the rule based decision methodology by rule-based network. In comparison with the extant rule-based classifiers, such as C4.5, CBA, CMAR and CPAR, our approach has two advantages. First, CRNN takes the coupling relations between rules from the training data into account in the prediction step. Second, CRNN automatically obtains higher performance on the structure and parameter learning than traditional neural network. CRNN uses the linear computing algorithm in neural network instead of the costly iterative learning algorithm. Two ways of the classification rule set generation are conducted in this paper for the CRNN evaluation, and CRNN achieves the satisfactory performance.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707015","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06707015.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CRNN: Integrating classification rules into neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707015/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CRNN: Integrating classification rules into neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707015/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14027136","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CRNN: Integrating classification rules into neural network","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083027S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6707015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6707023,"authors":[{"name":"\u00c9lia Yathie Matsumoto","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"],"firstName":"\u00c9lia Yathie","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37086665283"},{"name":"Em\u00edlio Del-Moral-Hernandez","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"],"firstName":"Em\u00edlio","lastName":"Del-Moral-Hernandez","id":"37564075500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6707023","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707023","abstract":"This study proposes a methodology to improve nonlinear regression model prediction assessment by the construction of a model for error pattern recognition to estimate whether the model outcome prediction value will fall outside the model confidence interval.

While substantial work has been published on addressing catastrophic forgetting in memoryless supervised learning systems (e.g. feedforward neural networks), the problem has received limited attention in the context of dynamic systems, particularly recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a solution for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in RNNs based on enhancing the Fixed Expansion Layer (FEL) neural network which exploits sparse coding of hidden neuron activations. Simulation results on several non-stationary data sets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707047","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06707047.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of catastrophic forgetting in recurrent neural networks using a Fixed Expansion Layer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707047/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of catastrophic forgetting in recurrent neural networks using a Fixed Expansion Layer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707047/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14027152","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of catastrophic forgetting in recurrent neural networks using a Fixed Expansion Layer","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054286S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6707047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6707049,"authors":[{"name":"Markus Mathias","affiliation":["VISICS, University of Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Markus","lastName":"Mathias","id":"38230903100"},{"name":"Radu Timofte","affiliation":["VISICS, University of Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Radu","lastName":"Timofte","id":"37393691200"},{"name":"Rodrigo Benenson","affiliation":["Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany"],"firstName":"Rodrigo","lastName":"Benenson","id":"37943481000"},{"name":"Luc Van Gool","affiliation":["VISICS, University of Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Van Gool","id":"37277167600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6707049","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":151,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1558},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707049","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Detectors","Feature extraction","Benchmark testing","Image color analysis","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image representation","object detection","pedestrians","road traffic","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic sign recognition","visual objects detection","public datasets","detection datasets","classification datasets","Belgium","Germany","pedestrian detection","digit classification","face classification","HOG features","sparse representations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707049","endPage":"8","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06707049.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic sign recognition \u2014 How far are we from the solution?","abstract":"Traffic sign recognition has been a recurring application domain for visual objects detection.

More recently, there has been a growing interest in the study of tracking control problem. In this paper, we discuss the design and stability properties of a special approximate/adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method for a general multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) discrete-time nonlinear optimal tracking control problem. The direct heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) design algorithm is firstly derived by incorporating the PID control rule into neural networks (NNs). This design approach considers using not only the typical state variables but also their derivatives and cumulative sums as inputs to the controller output. It is therefore expected to retain PID controller properties with additional learning capability. Moreover, our nonlinear control problem is formulated under a general condition that system nonlinearity is unknown and therefore it introduces modelling errors for the controller design. By using a Lyapunov stability construct, we provide new results of uniformly ultimately boundedness (UUB) for the proposed PIDNN-based direct HDP controller in discrete-time nonlinear tracking setting with desired tracking performance.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707054","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06707054.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of direct heuristic dynamic programming for nonlinear tracking control using PID neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707054/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stability of direct heuristic dynamic programming for nonlinear tracking control using PID neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707054/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14027105","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of direct heuristic dynamic programming for nonlinear tracking control using PID neural network","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073749S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6707054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6707055,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Lin","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37400771700"},{"name":"Nuyun Cao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Guangxi University, Nanning, China"],"firstName":"Nuyun","lastName":"Cao","id":"37086746816"},{"name":"Yuzhang Lin","affiliation":["department of electrical engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuzhang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37086742044"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6707055","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":82},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","delay systems","discrete systems","iterative methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based finite horizon optimal control","nonlinear systems","state delay","control constraints","finite horizon iterative ADP algorithm","finite time \u03b5-optimal control","performance index function","discrete nonlinear systems HJB equation","iterative process","mathematical proof"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707055","abstract":"In this paper, a new finite horizon iterative ADP algorithm is used to solve a class of nonlinear systems with state delay and control constraints problem and finite time \u03b5-optimal control is obtained.

For controlling DFIGs to maintain network frequency within a safety range, the proportional-derivative (PD) type virtual inertia controllers (VIC) are used in the active power control of DFIGs. However, as is well known, wind power generation conditions change directly with wind conditions in nature. Such changes create great challenge for the VIC design and actually force the control designs to go beyond the traditional problem formulation of using explicit objective functions associated with specific optimality. Controller parameter tuning thus necessarily becomes a part of the controller design. In this paper, we propose an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) structure for online tuning of the PD type virtual inertia controller parameters. The proposed ADP structure naturally takes into account the PD control into design objective and provides the PD controller with online parameter tuning capability through learning. Design and implementation details of the proposed methodology, including neural network weight initialization, design of the reinforcement signal, data preprocessing, and a bound on the online tuned parameters are discussed in this paper. Simulation studies carried out on the Power System Computer Aided Design/ Electro Magnetic Transient in DC System (PSCAD/EMTDC) software are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ADP-based online VIC parameter tuning methodology.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incorporating approximate dynamic programming-based parameter tuning into PD-type virtual inertia control of DFIGs","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707069","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06707069.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707069/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Incorporating approximate dynamic programming-based parameter tuning into PD-type virtual inertia control of DFIGs","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707069/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027287","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incorporating approximate dynamic programming-based parameter tuning into PD-type virtual inertia control of DFIGs","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091825S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6707069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707071,"authors":[{"name":"David Roclin","affiliation":["CEA, Laboratory For Enhancing Reliability of Embedded systems, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Roclin","id":"37076171700"},{"name":"Olivier Bichler","affiliation":["CEA, Laboratory For Enhancing Reliability of Embedded systems, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Bichler","id":"37543187200"},{"name":"Christian Gamrat","affiliation":["CEA, Laboratory For Enhancing Reliability of Embedded systems, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Gamrat","id":"37543188200"},{"name":"Simon J.

In this paper, we consider implementing such networks on a digital chip. We used an event-based simulator and we started from a previously established simulation, which emulates an analog spiking neural network, that can extract complex and overlapping, temporally correlated features. We modified this simulation to allow an easier integration in an embedded digital implementation. We first show that a four bits synaptic weight resolution is enough to achieve the best performance, although the network remains functional down to a 2 bits weight resolution. Then we show that a linear leak could be implemented to simplify the neurons leakage calculation. Finally, we demonstrate that an order-based STDP with a fixed number of potentiated synapses as low as 200 is efficient for features extraction. A simulation including these modifications, which lighten and increase the efficiency of digital spiking neural network implementation shows that the learning behavior is not affected, with a recognition rate of 98% in a cars trajectories detection application.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707071","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06707071.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design study of efficient digital order-based STDP neuron implementations for extracting temporal features","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Mathematical model","Feature extraction","Equations","Hardware","Genetics","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","digital simulation","feature extraction","neural nets","object detection","object recognition","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["car trajectories detection application","recognition rate","neurons leakage calculation","synaptic weight resolution","embedded digital implementation","temporally correlated features","event-based simulator","digital chip","spiking neural networks","temporal feature extraction","efficient digital order-based STDP neuron implementations","design study"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design study of efficient digital order-based STDP neuron implementations for extracting temporal features","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14027293","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6707071/","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707071/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design study of efficient digital order-based STDP neuron implementations for extracting temporal features","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P364.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066521S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6707071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6707072,"authors":[{"name":"Jerry B.

Starting with the classic leaky integrate-and-fire neuron, we add: (a) configurable and reproducible stochasticity to the input, the state, and the output; (b) four leak modes that bias the internal state dynamics; (c) deterministic and stochastic thresholds; and (d) six reset modes for rich finite-state behavior. The model supports a wide variety of computational functions and neural codes. We capture 50+ neuron behaviors in a library for hierarchical composition of complex computations and behaviors. Although designed with cognitive algorithms and applications in mind, serendipitously, the neuron model can qualitatively replicate the 20 biologically-relevant behaviors of a dynamical neuron model.","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06707077.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707077","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive computing building block: A versatile and efficient digital neuron model for neurosynaptic cores","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive computing building block: A versatile and efficient digital neuron model for neurosynaptic cores","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707077/","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6707077/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027295","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive computing building block: A versatile and efficient digital neuron model for neurosynaptic cores","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.312223S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6707077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707078,"authors":[{"name":"Arnon Amir","affiliation":["Cognitive Computing group at IBM Research - Almaden, San Jose, California"],"firstName":"Arnon","lastName":"Amir","id":"37085455187"},{"name":"Pallab Datta","affiliation":["Cognitive Computing group at IBM Research - Almaden, San Jose, California"],"firstName":"Pallab","lastName":"Datta","id":"38555782300"},{"name":"William P.

The sequential programming paradigm of the von Neumann architecture is wholly unsuited for TrueNorth. Therefore, as our main contribution, we develop a new programming paradigm that permits construction of complex cognitive algorithms and applications while being efficient for TrueNorth and effective for programmer productivity. The programming paradigm consists of (a) an abstraction for a TrueNorth program, named Corelet, for representing a network of neurosynaptic cores that encapsulates all details except external inputs and outputs; (b) an object-oriented Corelet Language for creating, composing, and decomposing corelets; (c) a Corelet Library that acts as an ever-growing repository of reusable corelets from which programmers compose new corelets; and (d) an end-to-end Corelet Laboratory that is a programming environment which integrates with the TrueNorth architectural simulator, Compass, to support all aspects of the programming cycle from design, through development, debugging, and up to deployment. The new paradigm seamlessly scales from a handful of synapses and neurons to networks of neurosynaptic cores of progressively increasing size and complexity. The utility of the new programming paradigm is underscored by the fact that we have designed and implemented more than 100 algorithms as corelets for TrueNorth in a very short time span.","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06707078.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707078","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707078","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive computing programming paradigm: A Corelet Language for composing networks of neurosynaptic cores","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive computing programming paradigm: A Corelet Language for composing networks of neurosynaptic cores","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707078/","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6707078/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027143","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive computing programming paradigm: A Corelet Language for composing networks of neurosynaptic cores","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072382S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6707078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707079,"authors":[{"name":"Shuhei Kimura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Tottori University, Tottori, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuhei","lastName":"Kimura","id":"37559789800"},{"name":"Masanao Sato","affiliation":["National Institute for Basic Biology, National Institute for Natural Sciences, Okazaki, Japan"],"firstName":"Masanao","lastName":"Sato","id":"37086659939"},{"name":"Mariko Okada-Hatakeyama","affiliation":["RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Mariko","lastName":"Okada-Hatakeyama","id":"38308358700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6707079","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Biological system modeling","Equations","Gene expression","Computational modeling","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","inference mechanisms","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","Vohradsky neural network model","biochemical network","genetic network inference method","large-scale genetic network","high-dimensional function optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic network","neural network model","least-squares method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707079","abstract":"Vohradsk\u00fd has proposed a neural network model to describe biochemical networks.

In order to resolve the high-dimensionality in the estimation of the parameters of the Vohradsk\u00fd's neural network model, this study proposes a new method. The proposed method estimates the parameters of the neural network model by solving two-dimensional function optimization problems.

We define a fitness function including the total semblance of picked points, and constraints on the number of picked points, interval velocity, and velocity slope. GA can find an individual with the highest fitness value, and the picked points form the best polyline. We use simulation data and Nankai real seismic data in the experiments. We sequentially find the best parameter settings of GA. The picking result by GA is good and close to the human picking result. The result of velocity picking by GA is used for the normal move-out (NMO) correction and stacking. The stacking result shows that the signal is enhanced.

Simulations show that a noisy HMM converges faster than a noiseless HMM on the TIMIT data set.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707088","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06707088.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noisy hidden Markov models for speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707088/","displayDocTitle":"Noisy hidden Markov models for speech recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027177","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707088/","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noisy hidden Markov models for speech recognition","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123555S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6707088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707091,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Abu Jami'in","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Production and Systems Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Mohammad Abu","lastName":"Jami'in","id":"37085368235"},{"name":"Imam Sutrisno","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Production and Systems Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Imam","lastName":"Sutrisno","id":"38488884300"},{"name":"Jinglu Hu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Production and Systems Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"firstName":"Jinglu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37278204200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6707091","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707091","abstract":"This work exploits the idea on how to search parameter estimation and increase its convergence speed for the Liner Time Invariant (LTI) system. The convergence speed of parameter estimation is the one problem and plays an important role in the adaptive controller to increase performance. The well-known algorithm is the recursive least square algorithm. However, the speed of convergence is still low and is influenced by the number of sampling, which is represented by the limited availability for the information vector. We offer a new method to increase the convergence speed by applying Quasi-ARX model. Quasi-ARX model performs two steps identification process by presenting parameter estimation as a function over time. The first, parameters estimation of macro-part sub-model are searched by the least square error, and the second is to sharpen the searching by performing backpropagation learning of multi layer parceptron network.","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707091","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06707091.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep searching for parameter estimation of the linear time invariant (LTI) system by using Quasi-ARX neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Neural networks","Convergence","Vectors","Accuracy","Signal processing algorithms","Nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","backpropagation","convergence of numerical methods","least squares approximations","linear systems","multilayer perceptrons","neurocontrollers","parameter estimation","recursive estimation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep searching","parameter estimation","linear time invariant system","LTI system","convergence speed","adaptive controller","recursive least square algorithm","Quasi-ARX neural network","information vector","least square error","backpropagation learning","multilayer perceptron network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707091/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Deep searching for parameter estimation of the linear time invariant (LTI) system by using Quasi-ARX neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707091/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027424","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep searching for parameter estimation of the linear time invariant (LTI) system by using Quasi-ARX neural network","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078569S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6707091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6707095,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Shoja Ghiass","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Laval"],"firstName":"Reza Shoja","lastName":"Ghiass","id":"37688197000"},{"name":"Ognjen Arandjelovi\u0107","affiliation":["Deakin University"],"firstName":"Ognjen","lastName":"Arandjelovi\u0107","id":"37832785200"},{"name":"Hakim Bendada","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Laval"],"firstName":"Hakim","lastName":"Bendada","id":"37086749111"},{"name":"Xavier Maldague","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Laval"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Maldague","id":"37266668900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6707095","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Active appearance model","Face","Face recognition","Image segmentation","Shape","Imaging","Heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image representation","infrared imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["illumination-invariant face recognition","dual dimension AAM ensemble","thermal infrared spectrum","infrared imaging","thermal IR imaging","visible spectrum based approaches","visible spectrum illumination changes","facial heat emission patterns","active appearance model","synthetic image generation","neutral facial expression","piecewise affine warping","thermal IR face space","AAM fitting","thermal IR spectrum","person-specific representation","facial temperature emissions","ensemble framework","face matching","thermal IR motion videos","recognition performance"]}],"abstract":"Over the course of the last decade, infrared (IR) and particularly thermal IR imaging based face recognition has emerged as a promising complement to conventional, visible spectrum based approaches which continue to struggle when applied in practice. While inherently insensitive to visible spectrum illumination changes, IR data introduces specific challenges of its own, most notably sensitivity to factors which affect facial heat emission patterns, e.g. emotional state, ambient temperature, and alcohol intake. In addition, facial expression and pose changes are more difficult to correct in IR images because they are less rich in high frequency detail which is an important cue for fitting any deformable model. In this paper we describe a novel method which addresses these major challenges. Specifically, when comparing two thermal IR images of faces, we mutually normalize their poses and facial expressions by using an active appearance model (AAM) to generate synthetic images of the two faces with a neutral facial expression and in the same view (the average of the two input views). This is achieved by piecewise affine warping which follows AAM fitting. A major contribution of our work is the use of an AAM ensemble in which each AAM is specialized to a particular range of poses and a particular region of the thermal IR face space. Combined with the contributions from our previous work which addressed the problem of reliable AAM fitting in the thermal IR spectrum, and the development of a person-specific representation robust to transient changes in the pattern of facial temperature emissions, the proposed ensemble framework accurately matches faces across the full range of yaw from frontal to profile, even in the presence of scale variation (e.g. due to the varying distance of a subject from the camera). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on the largest public database of thermal IR images of faces and a newly acquired data set of thermal IR motion videos. Our approach achieved perfect recognition performance on both data sets, significantly outperforming the current state of the art methods even when they are trained with multiple images spanning a range of head views.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Illumination-invariant face recognition from a single image across extreme pose using a dual dimension AAM ensemble in the thermal infrared spectrum","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707095","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06707095.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Illumination-invariant face recognition from a single image across extreme pose using a dual dimension AAM ensemble in the thermal infrared spectrum","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707095/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","accessionNumber":"14027173","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Illumination-invariant face recognition from a single image across extreme pose using a dual dimension AAM ensemble in the thermal infrared spectrum","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109703S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6707095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707096,"authors":[{"name":"Reza Shoja Ghiass","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Laval"],"firstName":"Reza Shoja","lastName":"Ghiass","id":"37688197000"},{"name":"Ognjen Arandjelovi\u0107","affiliation":["Deakin University"],"firstName":"Ognjen","lastName":"Arandjelovi\u0107","id":"37832785200"},{"name":"Hakim Bendada","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Laval"],"firstName":"Hakim","lastName":"Bendada","id":"37086749111"},{"name":"Xavier Maldague","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Laval"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Maldague","id":"37266668900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6707096","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":954},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Feature extraction","Face recognition","Lighting","Robustness","Transforms","Imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","infrared imaging","lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["infrared face recognition","automatic face recognition","AFR","law enforcement applications","commercial applications","image processing","pattern recognition","computer graphics","physiology","visible spectrum images","illumination","pose changes","expression changes","facial disguises","IR"]}],"abstract":"Automatic face recognition (AFR) is an area with immense practical potential which includes a wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and it continues to be one of the most active research areas of computer vision.

Predictive modeling of power systems using conventional methods is time consuming and hence not well suited for real-time operation. In this study, neural network (NN) based non-linear predictor is used to predict states of power system for future time instance. Required control signals are computed based on predicted state variables and control set points. In order to reduce computation the problem is decoupled and solved in a cellular array of NNs. The cellular neural network (CNN) framework allows for accurate prediction with only minimal information exchange between neighboring predictors. The predicted states are then used in computing stability metrics that give proximity to point of instability. The situational awareness platform developed using CNN framework extracts information from data for the next time instance i.e. a step ahead of time and maps this data with geographical coordinates of power system components. The geographic information system (GIS) provides a visual indication of operating status of individual components as well as that of the entire system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707108/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14027381","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707108/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cellular neural network based situational awareness system for power grids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular neural network based situational awareness system for power grids","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067171S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6707108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6707113,"authors":[{"name":"Erich Schikuta","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Erich","lastName":"Schikuta","id":"37265457300"},{"name":"Erwin Mann","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer Science, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Erwin","lastName":"Mann","id":"37086661828"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6707113","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":156},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707113","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Cloud computing","Software as a service","Computational modeling","Computer architecture","Communities","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","neural nets","organisational aspects","service-oriented architecture","simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["N2Sky system","virtual organization environment","sky computing","cloud-based neural network simulation","RAVO reference architecture","service oriented architectures"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707113","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06707113.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"N2Sky \u2014 Neural networks as services in the clouds","abstract":"We present the N2Sky system, which provides a framework for the exchange of neural network specific knowledge, as neural network paradigms and objects, by a virtual organization environment.

The idea is to accelerate the process of detecting and classifying pediatric respiratory diseases by using neural networks. This is done by applying cross correlation between the input patterns and the input weights of neural networks in the frequency domain rather than time domain. Furthermore, such model is very useful for understanding the internal relation between the medical patterns. In addition, the input patterns are collected in one vector and manipulated as a one pattern. Moreover, before training neural networks, rough sets are used to reduce the length of the feature input vector. The most important feature elements are used to train the neural networks. The reduced input medical patterns are classified to one of eight diseases. Simulation results confirm the theoretical considerations as 98% of all tested cases are classified correctly. The presented model can be applied successfully for any other classification application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707116/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14027167","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707116/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast diagnosing of pediatric respiratory diseases by using high speed neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast diagnosing of pediatric respiratory diseases by using high speed neural networks","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076423S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6707116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6707117,"authors":[{"name":"Komalpreet Kaur","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA"],"firstName":"Komalpreet","lastName":"Kaur","id":"37086293886"},{"name":"Manish Wadhwa","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, South University, Virginia Beach, VA"],"firstName":"Manish","lastName":"Wadhwa","id":"37403340900"},{"name":"E.

For a set of three-component seismic data, four attributes were used as input to the ANN: Degree of Polarization (DOP), Auto Regression Coefficient (ARC), Ratio between Short time average and Long time average (STA/LTA) and Ratio of Vertical power to Total power (RV2T). These four attributes were calculated in the frequency band of 1-8 Hz with a 2 second moving window.

Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) are at the top of AC motors in high performance drive systems for EDVs. Traditionally, a PMSM is controlled with standard decoupled d-q vector control mechanisms. However, recent studies indicate that such mechanisms show serious limitations. This paper investigates how to mitigate such problems using a nested-loop neural network architecture to control a PMSM. The neural network implements a dynamic programming algorithm and is trained using backpropagation through time. The performance of the neural controller is studied for typical vector control conditions and compared with conventional vector control methods, which demonstrates the neural vector control strategy proposed in this paper is effective. Even in a highly dynamic switching environment, the neural vector controller shows strong ability to track rapidly changing reference commands, tolerate system disturbances, and satisfy control requirements for complex EDV drive needs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707124/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14027168","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707124/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Nested-loop neural network vector control of permanent magnet synchronous motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nested-loop neural network vector control of permanent magnet synchronous motors","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"P417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.168978S","chronDate":"4-9 Aug. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6691896","isNumber":"6706705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6691896","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6706705","articleId":"6707124","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6707127,"authors":[{"name":"Noriyuki Muramoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Hyogo, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Noriyuki","lastName":"Muramoto","id":"38489039300"},{"name":"Teijiro Isokawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Hyogo, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Teijiro","lastName":"Isokawa","id":"37281356900"},{"name":"Haruhiko Nishimura","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Hyogo, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Haruhiko","lastName":"Nishimura","id":"37281322900"},{"name":"Nobuyuki Matsui","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Hyogo, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan"],"firstName":"Nobuyuki","lastName":"Matsui","id":"37281312900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6129-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6128-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-4407"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-4393"}],"articleNumber":"6707127","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707127","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Biological neural networks","Quaternions","Vectors","Training data","Educational institutions","Chaos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","computer graphics","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three dimensional data","quaternionic neural network","layered neural network","quaternionic encoding variable","local analyticity","Wirtinger representation","backpropagation learning algorithm","tanh function","activation function","Lorentz attractor","affine transformation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707127","pdfPath":"/iel7/6691896/6706705/06707127.pdf","publicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","displayPublicationTitle":"The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6706705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On processing three dimensional data by quaternionic neural networks","abstract":"The performance of layered neural networks with quaternionic encoding variables are investigated in this paper.

Therefore, the postulates of quantum mechanics are given based on one interpretation that is called the Copenhagen interpretation. The main pillars of quantum mechanics are: Superposition, Interference, and Entanglement. Quantum Information Systems comprise three disciplines: Quantum Computation, Quantum Communication, and Quantum Control. Each one of them has a number of topics with some implementations that have reached the commercial level. Quantum Computation has three models: the circuit model that is using different techniques like superconducting elements and special Silicon-based elements. The Adiabatic quantum model has reached the commercial stage through a start-up company using superconducting chips. The categorical quantum model is based on category theory and one of its main applications is the study and verification of network and cryptographic protocols. Quantum communication started with defining the basic unit of information, the qubit. Then the quantum compression theorem was proved. The quantum channel capacity problem was divided into two problems: transmitting classical information over a quantum channel, and transmitting quantum information over a quantum channel. The first problem was partially resolved. However, the second problem is being researched upon. Two applications will be briefly presented: quantum teleportation and superdense coding. Both of them employs quantum entanglement. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) using cryptographic protocols has received much attention due its importance in network security. A number of protocols have been proposed and some of them have been implemented, and now a number of commercial products have been announced. Also, some experimental networks have been implemented. QKD using space links have been proposed and experimented with. In few years quantum satellites will be launched. Quantum cryptographic protocols are being proposed to protect infrastructure networks like the electric power grid. Also, it is being used as a countermeasure against global spying networks like ECHELON that are detrimental for national economies. The Quantum Internet is also being considered using quantum teleportation together with Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with some experimental work going on. Quantum Control is essential for both Quantum Computation and Quantum Communication. Intensive research is going on in: State estimation (called Quantum State Tomography), system identification (called Quantum Process Tomography), and Quantum Feedback Control. The basic concepts will be briefly considered in this presentation. University education has witnessed major changes to support the above developments.

Computing resource are provisioned and released on demand. This elastic nature of resource provisioning allows for the \u201cpay as you go\u201d concept. Hence, it makes the major benefit of adopting cloud-based solutions. Accordingly, there is a need to evaluate the performance of the resource provisioning algorithm adopted by cloud computing platforms. In this paper, an approach for modeling and analyzing the performance of the resource provisioning process in a cloud computing platform is presented. The proposed model utilizes Stochastic Process Algebra (SPA) as an engine to simulate the components involved in the resource provisioning process along with the interactions among them. A case study using the cloud computing platform Aneka is performed. Experimental results show the effect of different parameters on the provisioning process which suggests the suitability of the proposed approach to evaluate design alternatives.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 8th International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems (ICCES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695805/6707143/06707168.pdf","startPage":"39","endPage":"44","publicationTitle":"2013 8th International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems (ICCES)","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2013.6707168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2013.6707168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707143","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of dynamic resource allocation in cloud computing platforms using Stochastic Process Algebra","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Resource management","Dynamic scheduling","Algebra","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","process algebra","resource allocation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","dynamic resource allocation","stochastic process algebra","revolutionary concept","computing services","virtualization","computing resource","cloud based solutions","resource provisioning algorithm","resource provisioning process","cloud computing platform Aneka"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","stochastic process algebra","Aneka","PEPA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707168/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of dynamic resource allocation in cloud computing platforms using Stochastic Process Algebra","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707168/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029314","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"26-28 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of dynamic resource allocation in cloud computing platforms using Stochastic Process Algebra","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"022Paper14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073305S","chronDate":"26-28 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695805","isNumber":"6707143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695805","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6707143","articleId":"6707168","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6707172,"authors":[{"name":"Medhat A.

One of the fundamental issues in this environment is related to task scheduling. Cloud task scheduling is an NP-hard optimization problem, and many meta-heuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve it. A good task scheduler should adapt its scheduling strategy to the changing environment and the types of tasks. In this paper a cloud task scheduling policy based on ant colony optimization algorithm compared with different scheduling algorithms FCFS and round-robin, has been presented. The main goal of these algorithms is minimizing the makespan of a given tasks set. Ant colony optimization is random optimization search approach that will be used for allocating the incoming jobs to the virtual machines. Algorithms have been simulated using Cloudsim toolkit package. Experimental results showed that the ant colony optimization outperformed FCFS and round-robin algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14029319","htmlLink":"/document/6707172/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Cloud task scheduling based on ant colony optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud task scheduling based on ant colony optimization","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"026Paper90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07687S","chronDate":"26-28 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695805","isNumber":"6707143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695805","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"6707143","articleId":"6707172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":6707202,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Fathy Abd Elfatah","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Al Azhar University, Qena, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ahmed Fathy","lastName":"Abd Elfatah","id":"37086782897"},{"name":"Ibrahim F.

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm has become the optimum choice for various security services in numerous applications due to its reliability and flexibility. The AES algorithm faces two main challenges which included in both encryption/decryption speed, and the consumed implementation area. This paper presents an optimized implementation of the AES algorithm with respect to the consumed implementation area by combining both data and key expansion approaches. The optimized implementation of AES increases its applicability in the small sized devices such as mobile phones and smart cards.

The extraction process is carried out blindly without the need to refer to the original host image. Experimental results highlighted the excellent invisibility performance of the proposed algorithm.

Based on this fundamental step, the subsequent processing is shaped up. Many standard algorithms are known for detecting moving objects, with different performances and time complexities, including optical flow, background subtraction, frame difference and wavelet filters. Existing frame differencing has a limited capability in detecting slowly moving objects, especially in the presence of illumination variations. In this paper, an innovative technique is proposed for the detection of moving objects in scenes with non-uniform illumination. The proposed technique is based on the idea of accumulative frame differencing and is enhanced using 2-D Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Evaluation and comparison of the proposed technique with the different existing ones demonstrate the efficiency of using the 2-D DWT in the process of motion detection.","doi":"10.1109/ICCES.2013.6707215","publicationTitle":"2013 8th International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems (ICCES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 8th International Conference on Computer Engineering & Systems (ICCES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695805/6707143/06707215.pdf","startPage":"255","endPage":"261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCES.2013.6707215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion detection using wavelet-enhanced accumulative frame differencing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707215","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707215/","displayDocTitle":"Motion detection using wavelet-enhanced accumulative frame differencing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029326","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707215/","conferenceDate":"26-28 Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion detection using wavelet-enhanced accumulative frame differencing","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"091Paper82.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120109S","chronDate":"26-28 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695805","isNumber":"6707143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695805","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6707143","articleId":"6707215","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6707216,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud A.

RHSEG is a method developed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) which is more efficient than other traditional methods for high spatial resolution images. The RHSEG algorithm is also implemented on both GPU cluster and hybrid CPU/GPU cluster and the results are compared with the hybrid CPU/GPU implementation. For single hybrid computational node of 8 cores, a speedup of 6x is achieved using both CPU and GPU.

Scheduling task graphs on heterogeneous architecture increases the difficulty of the problem. These heterogeneous architectures like any other platforms are prone to faults thus fault tolerance techniques must be used to ensure accomplishment of the job therefore task replication is used to achieve fault tolerance. However scheduling complexity is increased and the schedule length is affected dramatically due to duplication. Also task replication introduces great communication delays overhead.

For solving these challenges, multiple methods were studied during the last decade. It was shown that through the transmission of coded excitation pulses to the ultrasound probe, we can obtain an enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Different methods of beamforming of the back-scattered echoes appeared last years, both in time and spatial domain. These methods improve the lateral resolution. In this paper, we describe an original solution which combines the adaptive beamforming in time domain with the coded excitation. The final ultrasound images will gain in both lateral resolution and SNR.","doi":"10.1109/EHB.2013.6707317","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 E-Health and Bioengineering Conference (EHB)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695804/6707229/06707317.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EHB.2013.6707317","publicationTitle":"2013 E-Health and Bioengineering Conference (EHB)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive beamforming with coded excitation in ultrasound imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive beamforming with coded excitation in ultrasound imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707317/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707317/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029136","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"21-23 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive beamforming with coded excitation in ultrasound imaging","confLoc":"Iasi, Romania","sourcePdf":"20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042909S","chronDate":"21-23 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695804","isNumber":"6707229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695804","xplore-issue":"6707229","articleId":"6707317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6707424,"authors":[{"name":"Erl-Huei Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, R.O.

The interference at the receiver side is considered as a vector-valued stochastic process characterized by a covariance matrix which is to be estimated and used subsequently for defining the retransmission subspace identifier to be fed back to the transmitter. We consider both the sample covariance matrix (SCM) estimator and an empirical Bayesian (EB) scheme as well as different probability distribution functions and correlation properties of the interference vectors. It turns out that the proposed RSM modification substantially improves the bit-error rate performance in the presence of interference where EB and SCM perform comparably due to the conditions for the covariance matrix estimation in RSM with limited frame length. Moreover, adaptive RSM leads to a performance being independent of the correlation coefficient of the interference vector.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6707428/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029760","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Recursive Spatial Multiplexing (RSM) in interference-limited scenarios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Recursive Spatial Multiplexing (RSM) in interference-limited scenarios","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1569803609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07321S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695813","isNumber":"6707422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695813","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6707422","articleId":"6707428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6707430,"authors":[{"name":"Tommaso Cella","affiliation":["NTNU and UniK, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Tommaso","lastName":"Cella","id":"38244317300"},{"name":"P\u00e5l Orten","affiliation":["ABB and UniK, Billingstad, Norway"],"firstName":"P\u00e5l","lastName":"Orten","id":"37298519400"},{"name":"Torbj\u00f8rn Ekman","affiliation":["NTNU, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Torbj\u00f8rn","lastName":"Ekman","id":"37318026000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2184-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707430","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Arrays","Receivers","Wireless communication","Antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Attenuation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microstrip antenna arrays","millimetre wave antenna arrays","millimetre wave propagation","MIMO systems","radio links","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless access","MIMO subarrays","outdoor radio link","line-of-sight system","radio transmitter","radio receiver","MIMO system","uniform rectangular array","URA","patch antenna","link budget","frequency 71 GHz to 76 GHz","distance 200 m"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","line-of-sight","capacity","antenna arrays","mm-wave"]}],"abstract":"This paper shows a way to get high capacity outdoor radio link for a line-of-sight (LOS) system in the 70 GHz portion of the E-band (71-76 GHz).

Each node of the MIMO system consists of a uniform rectangular array (URA), where the single element is a patch antenna, in order to achieve higher gains and narrow beams. Such configuration is much more compact compared to the antennas currently applied for the same bandwidth. We optimize the inter-element distances at the transmitter and the receiver.

When a plausible statistical modeling of primary user signal is given, the amount of interference to primary user signal can be estimated and used to produce the optimal spectrum sensing and data transmission time. However, previous works on this area have some flaws in the modeling of interference to primary user signal. In this study we apply more accurate modeling of primary user signal to the spectrum sensing framework. Our method uses Chapman-Kolmogorov equation to model the behavior of primary user signal in a certain instant and derive the optimal spectrum sensing framework. Numerical results show that the proposed method results in higher throughput of secondary users than previous methods.","doi":"10.1109/ISWPC.2013.6707442","displayPublicationTitle":"International Symposium on Wireless and pervasive Computing (ISWPC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695813/6707422/06707442.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWPC.2013.6707442","publicationTitle":"International Symposium on Wireless and pervasive Computing (ISWPC)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal spectrum sensing framework with interference constraint in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Optimal spectrum sensing framework with interference constraint in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707442/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707442/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029763","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal spectrum sensing framework with interference constraint in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"1569817077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047955S","chronDate":"20-22 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695813","isNumber":"6707422","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695813","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6707422","articleId":"6707442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6707496,"authors":[{"name":"Quist-Aphetsi Kester","affiliation":["Lecturer Faculty of Informatics Ghana Technology University College Accra, Ghana"],"firstName":"Quist-Aphetsi","lastName":"Kester","id":"37085338719"},{"name":"Laurent Nana","affiliation":["Lab-STICC (UMR CNRS 6285) European University of Brittany University of Brest, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Nana","id":"37565617100"},{"name":"Anca Christine Pascu","affiliation":["Lab-STICC and HCTI European University of Brittany University of Brest, France"],"firstName":"Anca Christine","lastName":"Pascu","id":"37701694200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3067-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-9448"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-9413"}],"articleNumber":"6707496","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":346},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707496","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encryption","Photonics","Educational institutions","Physics","Satellites","Satellite broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum cryptography","satellite communication","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic encryption technique","video image","quantum cryptography","satellite communication","quantum key distribution","visual cryptographic technique","key agreement process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cryptography","Quantum key distribution","Encryption","Algorithm","image","satellite"]}],"abstract":"In today's world where drones play a major role in military warfare and domestic surveillance activities, there is a need for transmission of secured video images without any intrusion by a third party.

EBSR on the other hand augments the image with high frequency information to the image, thereby sharpening the edges. In this paper, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrid scheme performs better than the individual methods described above.","doi":"10.1109/ICIIP.2013.6707600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIP.2013.6707600","startPage":"288","endPage":"293","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Second International Conference on Image Information Processing (ICIIP-2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695812/6707528/06707600.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Second International Conference on Image Information Processing (ICIIP-2013)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707528","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid method for image super-resolution using steering kernel regression and example-based approaches","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid method for image super-resolution using steering kernel regression and example-based approaches","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707600/","accessionNumber":"14029657","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707600/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid method for image super-resolution using steering kernel regression and example-based approaches","confLoc":"Shimla, India","sourcePdf":"A21p288anamandra.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03728S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695812","isNumber":"6707528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695812","xplore-issue":"6707528","articleId":"6707600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6707612,"authors":[{"name":"Rajesh Mehta","affiliation":["CSE, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Mehta","id":"37602915100"},{"name":"Navin Rajpal","affiliation":["CSE, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, New Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Navin","lastName":"Rajpal","id":"37297841800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6101-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6099-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6100-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707612","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707612","abstract":"A novel gray scale image watermarking scheme in frequency domain is proposed through the combination of image features, extracted using fractional discrete Cosine transform (DFrCT) with general regression neural network (GRNN). The watermark is a binary image which is embedded into the output obtained by trained GRNN based on the relationship between the low frequency (LF) DFrCT coefficient and its neighborhood of each selected block according to human visual system criteria. Due to better function approximation, learning and generalization capability of GRNN, extraction of watermark using trained neural network is quite successful.

Images captured by onboard cameras on a MAV need to be processed in real time and for this purpose segmentation algorithm is used. On board processing of images is a major challenging task as it involves deciphering images and performing the required operations. In this work, a new image segmentation algorithm has been built using morphological operations, thresholding, edge detection and merging. A detailed analysis has been carried out for choice of appropriate segmentation techniques for design and field-programmable gate array implementation of image segmentation. Software reference model for image segmentation using edge based segmentation and region based segmentation has been developed. The proposed image segmentation algorithm has 17% improvement in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio values compared to exiting algorithms. The design consumes power of 0.322W and operates at a maximum frequency of 152.26 MHz in FPGA. Implementation in application-specific integrated circuit occupies less area and power and the working frequency is 188.68 MHz nearly 23.9 percent more than FPGA. The designed algorithm can be extended to include video segmentation and the two color segmentation implementation carried out in this work can also be extended to color image segmentation.","doi":"10.1109/ICIIP.2013.6707614","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Second International Conference on Image Information Processing (ICIIP-2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Second International Conference on Image Information Processing (ICIIP-2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695812/6707528/06707614.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIP.2013.6707614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707528","startPage":"352","endPage":"357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and ASIC implementation of image segmentation algorithm for autonomous MAV navigation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and ASIC implementation of image segmentation algorithm for autonomous MAV navigation","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707614/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029726","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6707614/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and ASIC implementation of image segmentation algorithm for autonomous MAV navigation","confLoc":"Shimla, India","sourcePdf":"A22p352bharat.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074585S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695812","isNumber":"6707528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695812","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6707528","articleId":"6707614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6707623,"authors":[{"name":"Hetul Sanghvi","affiliation":["Texas Instruments (I) Pvt.

There are several challenges in implementing this functionality in hardware - (1) to identify the minimum set of reference pixels needed to give the required prediction image in an efficient manner from external memory, (2) to fetch these pixels from the external memory at a rate to match the 4K Ultra HD frame processing and (3) to perform the processing in a power optimal manner. This paper describes architecture for motion compensation hardware which integrates command preparation, a 2D reference pixel data caching scheme, a DMA engine and a power efficient pixel interpolation engine. The 2D caching technique helps in reducing the LPDDR2 SDRAM power for a 4k Ultra-HD decoder by up to 70 mW and bandwidth by 800 MB/s (50% reduction), increasing the typical 1080p30 HDMI playback time by 2 hours. The motion compensation hardware module dissipates 3 mW for 1080p30 decode.","doi":"10.1109/ICIIP.2013.6707623","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Second International Conference on Image Information Processing (ICIIP-2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Second International Conference on Image Information Processing (ICIIP-2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695812/6707528/06707623.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIP.2013.6707623","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707528","startPage":"400","endPage":"404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low power architecture for motion compensation in a 4K Ultra-HD AVC and HEVC video codec system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707623","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low power architecture for motion compensation in a 4K Ultra-HD AVC and HEVC video codec system","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707623/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14040393","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6707623/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low power architecture for motion compensation in a 4K Ultra-HD AVC and HEVC video codec system","confLoc":"Shimla, India","sourcePdf":"A23p400sanghvi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055285S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695812","isNumber":"6707528","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695812","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6707528","articleId":"6707623","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707634,"authors":[{"name":"Haradhan Chel","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communication, CIT, Kokrajhar, Assam, India"],"firstName":"Haradhan","lastName":"Chel","id":"37085687545"},{"name":"Debashis Nandi","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Technology, NIT, Durgapur, West Bengal, India"],"firstName":"Debashis","lastName":"Nandi","id":"37085378423"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6101-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6099-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-6100-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707634","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Image registration","Noise","Optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Accuracy","Correlation coefficient"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image registration","lighting","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noisy environment","particle swarm optimization","multiple image overlaying","sensors","reference image","remote sensing","super-resolution","medicine","cartography","computer vision","image degradations","noise variations","blur variations","illumination variations","accurate rigid image registration technique","PSO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","rigid registration","Mean square error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707634","abstract":"Image registration is a process of overlaying multiple images of the same scene taken from different viewpoints or by different sensors or at different times.

In this paper, we propose a k-component recurrent neural network language model using curriculum learning (CL-KRNNLM) to address within-domain variations. Based on a Dutch-language corpus, we investigate three methods of curriculum learning that exploit dedicated component models for specific sub-domains. Under an oracle situation in which context information is known during testing, we experimentally test three hypotheses. The first is that domain-dedicated models perform better than general models on their specific domains. The second is that curriculum learning can be used to train recurrent neural network language models (RNNLMs) from general patterns to specific patterns. The third is that curriculum learning, used as an implicit weighting method to adjust the relative contributions of general and specific patterns, outperforms conventional linear interpolation. Under the condition that context information is unknown during testing, the CL-KRNNLM also achieves improvement over conventional RNNLM by 13% relative in terms of word prediction accuracy. Finally, the CL-KRNNLM is tested in an additional experiment involving N-best rescoring on a standard data set. Here, the context domains are created by clustering the training data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and k-means clustering.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707696","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707696","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707696.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"K-component recurrent neural network language models using curriculum learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707696/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"K-component recurrent neural network language models using curriculum learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707696/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14029373","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"K-component recurrent neural network language models using curriculum learning","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135106S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707696","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6707705,"authors":[{"name":"George Saon","affiliation":["IBM T.

Experimental results on a Switchboard 300 hours corpus show that DNNs trained on speaker independent features and i-vectors achieve a 10% relative improvement in word error rate (WER) over networks trained on speaker independent features only. These networks are comparable in performance to DNNs trained on speaker-adapted features (with VTLN and FMLLR) with the advantage that only one decoding pass is needed.

One approach to address the lack of resources is to make use of data from multiple languages. A popular direction in recent years is to use bottleneck features, or hybrid systems, trained on multilingual data for speech-to-text (STT) systems. This paper presents an investigation into the application of these multilingual approaches to spoken term detection. Experiments were run using the IARPA Babel limited language pack corpora (~10 hours/language) with 4 languages for initial multilingual system development and an additional held-out target language. STT gains achieved through using multilingual bottleneck features in a Tandem configuration are shown to also apply to keyword search (KWS). Further improvements in both STT and KWS were observed by incorporating language questions into the Tandem GMM-HMM decision trees for the training set languages. Adapted hybrid systems performed slightly worse on average than the adapted Tandem systems. A language independent acoustic model test on the target language showed that retraining or adapting of the acoustic models to the target language is currently minimally needed to achieve reasonable performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707719/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029374","htmlLink":"/document/6707719/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Investigation of multilingual deep neural networks for spoken term detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of multilingual deep neural networks for spoken term detection","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000138.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067057S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6707731,"authors":[{"name":"Damianos Karakos","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Damianos","lastName":"Karakos","id":"37320573900"},{"name":"Richard Schwartz","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Schwartz","id":"37284932800"},{"name":"Stavros Tsakalidis","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Stavros","lastName":"Tsakalidis","id":"37374712400"},{"name":"Le Zhang","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086107366"},{"name":"Shivesh Ranjan","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Shivesh","lastName":"Ranjan","id":"37085761436"},{"name":"Tim Ng","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Ng","id":"37422790100"},{"name":"Roger Hsiao","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Hsiao","id":"37085732767"},{"name":"Guruprasad Saikumar","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Guruprasad","lastName":"Saikumar","id":"37705167200"},{"name":"Ivan Bulyko","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Bulyko","id":"37424791500"},{"name":"Long Nguyen","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37276540000"},{"name":"John Makhoul","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Makhoul","id":"37283421800"},{"name":"Frantisek Grezl","affiliation":["SpeechFIT, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Frantisek","lastName":"Grezl","id":"37064183800"},{"name":"Mirko Hannemann","affiliation":["SpeechFIT, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Mirko","lastName":"Hannemann","id":"38187282700"},{"name":"Martin Karafiat","affiliation":["SpeechFIT, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Karafiat","id":"37697927900"},{"name":"Igor Szoke","affiliation":["SpeechFIT, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Szoke","id":"37864454100"},{"name":"Karel Vesely","affiliation":["SpeechFIT, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Karel","lastName":"Vesely","id":"37085500605"},{"name":"Lori Lamel","affiliation":["CNRS, LIMSI, France"],"firstName":"Lori","lastName":"Lamel","id":"37284501100"},{"name":"Viet-Bac Le","affiliation":["Vocapia Research, France"],"firstName":"Viet-Bac","lastName":"Le","id":"37413743900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707731","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":438},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707731","abstract":"We present two techniques that are shown to yield improved Keyword Spotting (KWS) performance when using the ATWV/MTWV performance measures: (i) score normalization, where the scores of different keywords become commensurate with each other and they more closely correspond to the probability of being correct than raw posteriors; and (ii) system combination, where the detections of multiple systems are merged together, and their scores are interpolated with weights which are optimized using MTWV as the maximization criterion.

Further, emotion recognition systems typically work with noisy high-dimensional data, rendering it difficult to find representative features and train an effective classifier. We tackle this problem by using Deep Belief Networks, which can model complex and non-linear high-level relationships between low-level features. We propose and evaluate a suite of hybrid classifiers based on Hidden Markov Models and Deep Belief Networks.

In this paper, we report results that challenge this conventional approach. We present new models of tone that deliver consistent performance improvements for tonal languages (Cantonese, Vietnamese) and even modest improvements for non-tonal languages. Using neural networks for feature integration and fusion, these models achieve significant gains throughout, and provide us with system uniformity and standardization across all languages, tonal and non-tonal.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707740","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707740.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"266","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Models of tone for tonal and non-tonal languages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707740/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Models of tone for tonal and non-tonal languages","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14029402","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6707740/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Models of tone for tonal and non-tonal languages","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062236S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6707741,"authors":[{"name":"Karel Vesel\u00fd","affiliation":["Brno University of Technology, IT4I Center of Excellence, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Karel","lastName":"Vesel\u00fd","id":"38234002600"},{"name":"Mirko Hannemann","affiliation":["Brno University of Technology, IT4I Center of Excellence, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Mirko","lastName":"Hannemann","id":"38187282700"},{"name":"Luk\u00e1\u0161 Burget","affiliation":["Brno University of Technology, IT4I Center of Excellence, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Luk\u00e1\u0161","lastName":"Burget","id":"38469472200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707741","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":78,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":784},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Data models","Lattices","Speech","Maximum likelihood decoding","Acoustics","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["entropy","learning (artificial intelligence)","natural language processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semisupervised deep-neural network training","optimal strategy","DNN training","data selection","utterance-level confidence","frame-level confidence","semisupervised frame-discriminative training","sequence-discriminative sMBR training","disproportion reduction","untranscribed data","transcribed data","limited language pack condition","Surprise language task","Vietnamese language","IARPA Babel program","absolute word error rate improvement","absolute WER improvement","frame cross-entropy training","WER recovery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["semi-supervised training","self-training","deep network","DNN","Babel program"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707741","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707741.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707741","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-supervised training of Deep Neural Networks","abstract":"In this paper we search for an optimal strategy for semi-supervised Deep Neural Network (DNN) training.

However, the results in that work relied on recurrent-neural-network-specific objective functions, which are difficult to integrate with existing large vocabulary speech recognition systems. This paper investigates the use of DBLSTM as an acoustic model in a standard neural network-HMM hybrid system. We find that a DBLSTM-HMM hybrid gives equally good results on TIMIT as the previous work. It also outperforms both GMM and deep network benchmarks on a subset of the Wall Street Journal corpus. However the improvement in word error rate over the deep network is modest, despite a great increase in framelevel accuracy. We conclude that the hybrid approach with DBLSTM appears to be well suited for tasks where acoustic modelling predominates. Further investigation needs to be conducted to understand how to better leverage the improvements in frame-level accuracy towards better word error rates.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707742","startPage":"273","endPage":"278","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707742.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid speech recognition with Deep Bidirectional LSTM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707742/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid speech recognition with Deep Bidirectional LSTM","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14029379","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6707742/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid speech recognition with Deep Bidirectional LSTM","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07234S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"570","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":6707743,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Li","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Li","id":"37086664529"},{"name":"Khe Chai Sim","affiliation":["School of Computing, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Khe Chai","lastName":"Sim","id":"38240429000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707743","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":355},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Noise","Noise measurement","Hidden Markov models","Estimation","Speech recognition","Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","hidden Markov models","neural nets","source separation","spectral analysis","speech intelligibility","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid DNN-HMM based ASR system","hybrid DNN-hidden Markov model based ASR system","Aurora4","Aurora2","word error rate","masked features","multistyle trained baseline system","channel distortion","stereo data based training","DNN acoustic model noise robustness","DNN based estimation","state dependent estimation","mask estimation approach","speech separation","auditory scene analysis","noisy environments","human listener performance degradation","automatic speech recognition","spectral masking","deep neural networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Neural Network","Spectral Masking","Noise Robustness"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707743","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707743.pdf","startPage":"279","endPage":"284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707743","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707743","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving robustness of deep neural networks via spectral masking for automatic speech recognition","abstract":"The performance of human listeners degrades rather slowly compared to machines in noisy environments. This has been attributed to the ability of performing auditory scene analysis which separates the speech prior to recognition. In this work, we investigate two mask estimation approaches, namely the state dependent and the deep neural network (DNN) based estimations, to separate speech from noises for improving DNN acoustic models' noise robustness. The second approach has been experimentally shown to outperform the first one. Due to the stereo data based training and ill-defined masks for speech with channel distortions, both methods do not generalize well to unseen conditions and fail to beat the performance of the multi-style trained baseline system. However, the model trained on masked features demonstrates strong complementariness to the baseline model. The simple average of the two system's posteriors yields word error rates of 4.4% on Aurora2 and 12.3% on Aurora4.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707743/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029388","htmlLink":"/document/6707743/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improving robustness of deep neural networks via spectral masking for automatic speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving robustness of deep neural networks via spectral masking for automatic speech recognition","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056135S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707744,"authors":[{"name":"Pawel Swietojanski","affiliation":["Centre for Speech Technology Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Pawel","lastName":"Swietojanski","id":"38548382000"},{"name":"Arnab Ghoshal","affiliation":["Centre for Speech Technology Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Arnab","lastName":"Ghoshal","id":"37626764400"},{"name":"Steve Renals","affiliation":["Centre for Speech Technology Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Renals","id":"37284865700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707744","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":428},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Microphones","Speech","Training","Arrays","Array signal processing","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","hidden Markov models","microphone arrays","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid acoustic model","distant speech recognition","multichannel speech recognition","large vocabulary speech recognition","deep neural network","DNN","hidden Markov model","HMM","far field speech recognition","microphone array","Gaussian mixture model","GMM","word error rate reduction","WER reduction","single distant microphone"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distant Speech Recognition","Deep Neural Networks","Microphone Arrays","Beamforming","Meeting recognition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707744","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707744.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid acoustic models for distant and multichannel large vocabulary speech recognition","abstract":"We investigate the application of deep neural network (DNN)-hidden Markov model (HMM) hybrid acoustic models for far-field speech recognition of meetings recorded using microphone arrays.

While features derived from mel-filter banks are quite popular, we argue that this filter bank is not really an appropriate choice as it is not learned for the objective at hand, i.e. speech recognition. In this paper, we explore replacing the filter bank with a filter bank layer that is learned jointly with the rest of a deep neural network. Thus, the filter bank is learned to minimize cross-entropy, which is more closely tied to the speech recognition objective. On a 50-hour English Broadcast News task, we show that we can achieve a 5% relative improvement in word error rate (WER) using the filter bank learning approach, compared to having a fixed set of filters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029354","htmlLink":"/document/6707746/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Learning filter banks within a deep neural network framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning filter banks within a deep neural network framework","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054421S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707747,"authors":[{"name":"Tara N.

This study aims at speeding up Hessian-free training, both by means of decreasing the amount of data used for training, as well as through reduction of the number of Krylov subspace solver iterations used for implicit estimation of the Hessian. In this paper, we develop an L-BFGS based preconditioning scheme that avoids the need to access the Hessian explicitly. Since L-BFGS cannot be regarded as a fixed-point iteration, we further propose the employment of flexible Krylov subspace solvers that retain the desired theoretical convergence guarantees of their conventional counterparts. Second, we propose a new sampling algorithm, which geometrically increases the amount of data utilized for gradient and Krylov subspace iteration calculations. On a 50-hr English Broadcast News task, we find that these methodologies provide roughly a 1.5\u00d7 speed-up, whereas, on a 300-hr Switchboard task, these techniques provide over a 2.3\u00d7 speedup, with no loss in WER. These results suggest that even further speed-up is expected, as problems scale and complexity grows.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating Hessian-free optimization for Deep Neural Networks by implicit preconditioning and sampling","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707747","startPage":"303","endPage":"308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707747.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating Hessian-free optimization for Deep Neural Networks by implicit preconditioning and sampling","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707747/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029423","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating Hessian-free optimization for Deep Neural Networks by implicit preconditioning and sampling","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083699S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707748,"authors":[{"name":"Naoyuki Kanda","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Kokubunji-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Naoyuki","lastName":"Kanda","id":"37566611300"},{"name":"Ryu Takeda","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Kokubunji-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryu","lastName":"Takeda","id":"37542752000"},{"name":"Yasunari Obuchi","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Kokubunji-shi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yasunari","lastName":"Obuchi","id":"37429047400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707748","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":34,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":651},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Accuracy","Acoustic distortion","Speech","Hidden Markov models","Acoustics","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","hidden Markov models","neural nets","spectral analysis","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low resource speech recognition","deep neural networks","acoustic model","hidden Markov models","elastic spectral distortion method","artificially training sample augmentation","vocal tract length distortion","speech rate distortion","frequency-axis random distortion","Japanese lecture recordings","vocabulary continuous speech recognition task","normally trained DNN-HMM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep neural network","speech recognition","elastic distortion"]}],"abstract":"An acoustic model based on hidden Markov models with deep neural networks (DNN-HMM) has recently been proposed and achieved high recognition accuracy.

Fourth, we introduce an effective strategy to use dropout during Hessian-free sequence training. We find that with these improvements, particularly with fMLLR and dropout, we are able to achieve an additional 2-3% relative improvement in WER on a 50-hour Broadcast News task over our previous best CNN baseline.

This training is often carried out using a Hessian-free (HF) quasi-Newton approach, although other methods such as stochastic gradient descent have also been applied successfully. In this paper we present a novel stochastic approach to HF sequence training inspired by recently proposed stochastic average gradient (SAG) method. SAG reuses gradient information from past updates, and consequently simulates the presence of more training data than is really observed for each model update. We extend SAG by dynamically weighting the contribution of previous gradients, and by combining it to a stochastic HF optimization. We term the resulting procedure DSAG-HF. Experimental results for training DNNs on 1500h of audio data show that compared to baseline HF training, DSAG-HF leads to better held-out MPE loss after each model parameter update, and converges to an overall better loss value. Furthermore, since each update in DSAG-HF takes place over smaller amount of data, this procedure converges in about half the time as baseline HF sequence training.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Stochastic processes","Hafnium","Training data","Optimization","Data models","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","neural nets","Newton method","optimisation","speech recognition","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combining stochastic average gradient","Hessian-free optimization","deep neural networks","sequence training","minimum phone error","MPE","DNN","word error rate","automatic speech recognition","quasi-Newton approach","HF","stochastic average gradient","SAG method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Neural Network","Sequence Training","Stochastic Training","Hessian-free Optimization","Stochastic Average Gradient"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707750","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707750","startPage":"321","endPage":"325","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707750.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707750","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707750/","displayDocTitle":"Combining stochastic average gradient and Hessian-free optimization for sequence training of deep neural networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14029394","htmlLink":"/document/6707750/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining stochastic average gradient and Hessian-free optimization for sequence training of deep neural networks","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043264S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707751,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiheng Huang","affiliation":["Speech at Microsoft, Mountain View, CA"],"firstName":"Zhiheng","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086651406"},{"name":"Geoffrey Zweig","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA"],"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Zweig","id":"37298983000"},{"name":"Michael Levit","affiliation":["Speech at Microsoft, Mountain View, CA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Levit","id":"37313636100"},{"name":"Benoit Dumoulin","affiliation":["Speech at Microsoft, Mountain View, CA"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Dumoulin","id":"37085622899"},{"name":"Barlas Oguz","affiliation":["Speech at Microsoft, Mountain View, CA"],"firstName":"Barlas","lastName":"Oguz","id":"38571661600"},{"name":"Shawn Chang","affiliation":["Speech at Microsoft, Mountain View, CA"],"firstName":"Shawn","lastName":"Chang","id":"37677974200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707751","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":420},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707751","abstract":"Recurrent neural network (RNN) language models have proven to be successful to lower the perplexity and word error rate in automatic speech recognition (ASR).

The best performing system, a bilingual KL-HMM based on a deep MLP, jointly trained on Afrikaans and Dutch data, performs 13% better than a hybrid system using the same bilingual MLP and 26% better than a subspace Gaussian mixture system only trained on Afrikaans data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14040391","htmlLink":"/document/6707752/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Impact of deep MLP architecture on different acoustic modeling techniques for under-resourced speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of deep MLP architecture on different acoustic modeling techniques for under-resourced speech recognition","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045875S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6707753,"authors":[{"name":"Guangsen Wang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Guangsen","lastName":"Wang","id":"38469510200"},{"name":"Khe Chai Sim","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Khe Chai","lastName":"Sim","id":"38240429000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707753","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Context-dependent modelling of deep neural network using logistic regression","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707753.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"343","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707753","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Context","Training","Detectors","Context modeling","Vectors","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","neural nets","pattern clustering","regression analysis","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logistic regression","data sparsity problem","context dependent acoustic modelling","automatic speech recognition","decision tree state clusters","standard context dependent deep neural network","broad phone DNN systems","decoding","clustering problem","canonical state modelling","biphones","triphone state output probability","model complexity","acoustic scores","triphones","broadcast news transcription task","regression based CD DNN","absolute WER reduction","standard CD DNN system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Context-Dependent Modelling","Deep Neural Network","Logistic Regression","Canonical State Modelling","Articulatory Features"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707753","abstract":"The data sparsity problem of context-dependent acoustic modelling in automatic speech recognition is addressed by using the decision tree state clusters as the training targets in the standard context-dependent (CD) deep neural network (DNN) systems. As a result, the CD states within a cluster cannot be distinguished during decoding. This problem, referred to as the clustering problem, is not explicitly addressed in the current literature. In this paper, we formulate the CD DNN as an instance of the canonical state modelling technique based on a set of broad phone classes to address both the data sparsity and the clustering problems. The triphone is clustered into multiple sets of shorter biphones using broad phone contexts to address the data sparsity issue. A DNN is trained to discriminate the biphones within each set. The canonical states are represented by the concatenated log posteriors of all the broad phone DNNs. Logistic regression is used to transform the canonical states into the triphone state output probability. Clustering of the regression parameters is used to reduce model complexity while still achieving unique acoustic scores for all possible triphones. The experimental results on a broadcast news transcription task reveal that the proposed regression-based CD DNN significantly outperforms the standard CD DNN. The best system provides a 2.7% absolute WER reduction compared to the best standard CD DNN system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029360","htmlLink":"/document/6707753/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Context-dependent modelling of deep neural network using logistic regression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Context-dependent modelling of deep neural network using logistic regression","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054867S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707754,"authors":[{"name":"Jonas Gehring","affiliation":["Interactive Systems Lab, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Gehring","id":"37077571400"},{"name":"Quoc Bao Nguyen","affiliation":["Interactive Systems Lab, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Quoc Bao","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37086654913"},{"name":"Florian Metze","affiliation":["Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Metze","id":"37284940200"},{"name":"Alex Waibel","affiliation":["Interactive Systems Lab, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Waibel","id":"37284492500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707754","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Feature extraction","Training","Hidden Markov models","Data models","Neural networks","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","natural language processing","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DNN acoustic modeling","modular multilingual feature extraction network","deep neural network","training network","phoneme state posterior","single language system","multilingual network","monolingual network","language specific acoustic features","Vietnamese languge","acoustic model training","Pashto languge","Tagalog languge","Turkish languge","Cantonese languge"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep Neural Networks","Multi-Lingual Acoustic Modeling","Large-Vocabulary Speech Recognition","Low-Resource Acoustic Modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707754","abstract":"In this work, we propose several deep neural network architectures that are able to leverage data from multiple languages.

This approach has been shown to achieve superior performance for single-language systems, and here we demonstrate that feature extractors benefit significantly from being trained as multi-lingual networks with shared hidden representations. We also show that existing mono-lingual networks can be re-used in a modular fashion to achieve a similar level of performance without having to train new networks on multi-lingual data. Furthermore, we investigate in extending these architectures to make use of language-specific acoustic features.

Stereo-based piecewise linear compensation for environments (SPLICE), which is a powerful statistical approach for feature enhancement, models the probabilistic distribution of input noisy features as a mixture of Gaussians. However, soft assignment of an input vector to divided regions is sometimes done inadequately and the vector comes to go through inadequate conversion. Especially when conversion has to be linear, the conversion performance will be easily degraded. Feature enhancement using neural networks is another powerful approach which can directly model a non-linear relationship between noisy and clean feature spaces. In this case, however, it tends to suffer from over-fitting problems. In this paper, we attempt to mitigate this problem by reducing the number of model parameters to estimate. Our neural network is trained whose output layer is associated with the states in the clean feature space, not in the noisy feature space. This strategy makes the size of the output layer independent of the kind of a given noisy environment. Firstly, we characterize the distribution of clean features as a Gaussian mixture model and then, by using deep neural networks, estimate discriminatively the state in the clean space that an input noisy feature corresponds to. Experimental evaluations using the Aurora 2 dataset demonstrate that our proposed method has the best performance compared to conventional methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Signal to noise ratio","Speech","Neural networks","Training","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian noise","learning (artificial intelligence)","mixture models","neural nets","piecewise linear techniques","speech enhancement","speech recognition","state estimation","statistical analysis","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminative piecewise linear transformation","deep learning","noise robust automatic speech recognition","deep neural networks","statistical feature enhancement","stereo-based piecewise linear compensation for environments","SPLICE","statistical approach","probabilistic distribution","input noisy feature","input vector soft assignment","over-fitting problem","parameter estimation","neural network training","clean feature space","noisy feature space","Gaussian mixture model","state estimation","Aurora 2 dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic speech recognition","Noise robustness","feature enhancement","Deep learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707755","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707755.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707755","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative piecewise linear transformation based on deep learning for noise robust automatic speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative piecewise linear transformation based on deep learning for noise robust automatic speech recognition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707755/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707755/","accessionNumber":"14029361","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative piecewise linear transformation based on deep learning for noise robust automatic speech recognition","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061799S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6707756,"authors":[{"name":"Kris Demuynck","affiliation":["ELIS, Ghent University, Belgium"],"firstName":"Kris","lastName":"Demuynck","id":"37284539300"},{"name":"Fabian Triefenbach","affiliation":["ELIS, Ghent University, Belgium"],"firstName":"Fabian","lastName":"Triefenbach","id":"38235184400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707756","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Acoustics","Training","Speech","Adaptation models","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","maximum likelihood estimation","mixture models","neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["porting concepts","deep neural networks","Gaussian mixture models","speech recognition benchmarks","DNN-based modeling","GMM-based system","TIMIT database","maximum-likelihood trained Gaussians","deep GMM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["speech recognition","Gaussian mixture models","GMM","deep neural networks","DNN","deep structures"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707756","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707756.pdf","startPage":"356","endPage":"361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707756","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Porting concepts from DNNs back to GMMs","abstract":"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to outperform Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks.

Improving accessibility to these videos for the hearing impaired and for search and indexing purposes is an excellent application of automatic speech recognition. However, YouTube videos are extremely challenging for automatic speech recognition systems. Standard adapted Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based acoustic models can have word error rates above 50%, making this one of the most difficult reported tasks. Since 2009, YouTube has provided automatic generation of closed captions for videos detected to have English speech; the service now supports ten different languages.

Applying an \u201cisland of confidence\u201d filtering heuristic to select useful training segments, and increasing the model size by using 44,526 context dependent states with a low-rank final layer weight matrix approximation, improved performance by about 13% relative compared to previously reported sequence trained DNN results for this task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029409","htmlLink":"/document/6707758/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Large scale deep neural network acoustic modeling with semi-supervised training data for YouTube video transcription","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large scale deep neural network acoustic modeling with semi-supervised training data for YouTube video transcription","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109466S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707759,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Lu","affiliation":["Centre for Speech Technology Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Lu","id":"38066791000"},{"name":"Arnab Ghoshal","affiliation":["Centre for Speech Technology Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Arnab","lastName":"Ghoshal","id":"37626764400"},{"name":"Steve Renals","affiliation":["Centre for Speech Technology Research, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Renals","id":"37284865700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707759","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Training","Training data","Speech recognition","Viterbi algorithm","Transducers","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic transducers","approximation theory","expectation-maximisation algorithm","learning (artificial intelligence)","linguistics","reliability","speech recognition","vocabulary"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic data-driven pronunciation lexicon","large vocabulary speech recognition system","handcrafted pronunciation lexicon","linguistic expert","small seed lexicon availability","expectation maximization algorithm","EM algorithm","weighted finite state transducer","WFST","Viterbi approximation","switchboard corpus","conversational telephone speech","lexicon learning method","grapheme-to-phoneme transformation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lexical modelling","Probabilistic pronunciation model","Automatic speech recognition"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707759","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707759.pdf","startPage":"374","endPage":"379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic data-driven pronunciation lexicon for large vocabulary speech recognition","abstract":"Speech recognition systems normally use handcrafted pronunciation lexicons designed by linguistic experts. Building and maintaining such a lexicon is expensive and time consuming. This paper concerns automatically learning a pronunciation lexicon for speech recognition. We assume the availability of a small seed lexicon and then learn the pronunciations of new words directly from speech that is transcribed at word-level. We present two implementations for refining the putative pronunciations of new words based on acoustic evidence. The first one is an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm based on weighted finite state transducers (WFSTs) and the other is its Viterbi approximation. We carried out experiments on the Switchboard corpus of conversational telephone speech. The expert lexicon has a size of more than 30,000 words, from which we randomly selected 5,000 words to form the seed lexicon. By using the proposed lexicon learning method, we have significantly improved the accuracy compared with a lexicon learned using a grapheme-to-phoneme transformation, and have obtained a word error rate that approaches that achieved using a fully handcrafted lexicon.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6707759/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029396","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic data-driven pronunciation lexicon for large vocabulary speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic data-driven pronunciation lexicon for large vocabulary speech recognition","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.176846S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707759","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6707761,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Walter","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Walter","id":"38274442600"},{"name":"Timo Korthals","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Korthals","id":"37086064814"},{"name":"Reinhold Haeb-Umbach","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Reinhold","lastName":"Haeb-Umbach","id":"38271693200"},{"name":"Bhiksha Raj","affiliation":["Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States"],"firstName":"Bhiksha","lastName":"Raj","id":"37274448400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707761","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Training","Acoustics","Speech","Silicon","Iterative decoding","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","natural language processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical system","word discovery","DTW based initialization","linguistic structure","lexical discovery","phonetic discovery","hidden Markov model","emission probabilities","word pronunciations","dynamic time warping","acoustic pattern discovery system","temporal sequences","digit recognition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unsupervised","word discovery","acoustic units"]}],"abstract":"Discovering the linguistic structure of a language solely from spoken input asks for two steps: phonetic and lexical discovery. The first is concerned with identifying the categorical subword unit inventory and relating it to the underlying acoustics, while the second aims at discovering words as repeated patterns of subword units. The hierarchical approach presented here accounts for classification errors in the first stage by modelling the pronunciation of a word in terms of subword units probabilistically: a hidden Markov model with discrete emission probabilities, emitting the observed subword unit sequences. We describe how the system can be learned in a completely unsupervised fashion from spoken input. To improve the initialization of the training of the word pronunciations, the output of a dynamic time warping based acoustic pattern discovery system is used, as it is able to discover similar temporal sequences in the input data. This improved initialization, using only weak supervision, has led to a 40% reduction in word error rate on a digit recognition task.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707761","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707761.pdf","startPage":"386","endPage":"391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchical system for word discovery exploiting DTW-based initialization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707761/","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical system for word discovery exploiting DTW-based initialization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029418","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707761/","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical system for word discovery exploiting DTW-based initialization","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073719S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707763,"authors":[{"name":"Yajie Miao","affiliation":["Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Yajie","lastName":"Miao","id":"37077078700"},{"name":"Florian Metze","affiliation":["Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Metze","id":"37284940200"},{"name":"Shourabh Rawat","affiliation":["Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"],"firstName":"Shourabh","lastName":"Rawat","id":"37085508005"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707763","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":529},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Training","Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Speech","Acoustics","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","feedforward","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep maxout networks","low-resource speech recognition","feedforward architecture","computer vision datasets","large vocabulary continuous speech recognition","LVCSR tasks","limited transcribed speech","sparse feature extractors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep maxout networks","speech recognition","low-resource conditions","deep learning"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707763","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707763","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707763.pdf","startPage":"398","endPage":"403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep maxout networks for low-resource speech recognition","abstract":"As a feed-forward architecture, the recently proposed maxout networks integrate dropout naturally and show state-of-the-art results on various computer vision datasets.

Dynamic time warping (DTW) alignment cost has been the most commonly used measure, but it has well-known inadequacies. Some recently proposed alternatives require large amounts of training data. In the interest of finding more efficient, accurate, and low-resource alternatives, we consider the problem of embedding speech segments of arbitrary length into fixed-dimensional spaces in which simple distances (such as cosine or Euclidean) serve as a proxy for linguistically meaningful (phonetic, lexical, etc.) dissimilarities. Such embeddings would enable efficient audio indexing and permit application of standard distance learning techniques to segmental acoustic modeling. In this paper, we explore several supervised and unsupervised approaches to this problem and evaluate them on an acoustic word discrimination task. We identify several embedding algorithms that match or improve upon the DTW baseline in low-resource settings.","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707765","startPage":"410","endPage":"415","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707765.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fixed-dimensional acoustic embeddings of variable-length segments in low-resource settings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707765/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fixed-dimensional acoustic embeddings of variable-length segments in low-resource settings","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707765/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14029349","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed-dimensional acoustic embeddings of variable-length segments in low-resource settings","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067073S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":6707770,"authors":[{"name":"Roger Hsiao","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Hsiao","id":"37085732767"},{"name":"Tim Ng","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Ng","id":"37422790100"},{"name":"Franti\u0161ek Gr\u00e9zl","affiliation":["Speech@FIT, IT4I Center of Excellence, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Franti\u0161ek","lastName":"Gr\u00e9zl","id":"37064183800"},{"name":"Damianos Karakos","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Damianos","lastName":"Karakos","id":"37320573900"},{"name":"Stavros Tsakalidis","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Stavros","lastName":"Tsakalidis","id":"37374712400"},{"name":"Long Nguyen","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37276540000"},{"name":"Richard Schwartz","affiliation":["Raytheon BBN Technologies, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Schwartz","id":"37284932800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707770","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate semi-supervised training for low resource languages where the initial systems may have high error rate (\u2265 70.0% word eror rate).

Using a lattice at the input rather than a single string accounts for the uncertainty of the character/phoneme recognizer about the true label sequence. An example application is the discovery of lexical units from the output of an error-prone phoneme recognizer in a zero-resource setting, where neither the lexicon nor the language model is known. Recently a Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based approach has been published which we show to suffer from an issue: language model probabilities of known words are computed incorrectly. Fixing this issue leads to greatly improved precision and recall rates, however at the cost of increased computational complexity. It is therefore practical only for single input strings. To allow for a lattice input and thus for errors in the character/phoneme recognizer, we propose a computationally efficient suboptimal two-stage approach, which is shown to significantly improve the word segmentation performance compared to the earlier WFST approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707773.pdf","startPage":"458","endPage":"463","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707773","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707773","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised word segmentation from noisy input","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Probability","Computational modeling","Context","Transducers","Acoustics","Speech"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probability","speech recognition","unsupervised learning","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unsupervised word segmentation algorithm","phoneme lattice","character recognizer","label sequence","lexical unit discovery","error-prone phoneme recognizer","zero-resource setting","language model probabilities","computationally efficient suboptimal two-stage approach","word segmentation performance","noisy input"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic speech recognition","Unsupervised learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707773/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised word segmentation from noisy input","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707773/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029398","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised word segmentation from noisy input","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052427S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707775,"authors":[{"name":"Frantiseli Gr\u00e9zl","affiliation":["Speech@FIT, IT4I Center of Excellence, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Frantiseli","lastName":"Gr\u00e9zl","id":"37064183800"},{"name":"Martin Karafi\u00e1t","affiliation":["Speech@FIT, IT4I Center of Excellence, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Karafi\u00e1t","id":"37697927900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2756-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707775","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":22,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":207},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Artificial neural networks","Hidden Markov models","Feature extraction","Accuracy","Training data","Labeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semisupervised bootstrapping approach","neural network feature extractor training","neural network training","bottle-neck feature extractor","GMM-HMM recognizer","transcription","confidence assignment","untranscribed data","supervised data","automatically transcribed segments"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semi-supervised training","bootstrapping","bottle-neck features"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents bootstrapping approach for neural network training.

With this approach, it is possible to recover 40-55% of the difference between partially and fully transcribed data (3 to 5% absolute improvement over NN trained on supervised data only). Using 70-85% of automatically transcribed segments with the highest confidence was found optimal to achieve this result.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-supervised bootstrapping approach for neural network feature extractor training","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","doi":"10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707775","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding","pdfPath":"/iel7/6695806/6707689/06707775.pdf","startPage":"470","endPage":"475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707689","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Semi-supervised bootstrapping approach for neural network feature extractor training","conferenceDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707775/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029358","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-supervised bootstrapping approach for neural network feature extractor training","confLoc":"Olomouc, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"0000470.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055808S","chronDate":"8-12 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6695806","isNumber":"6707689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6695806","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6707689","articleId":"6707775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6707796,"authors":[{"name":"Qia Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Qia","lastName":"Wang","id":"38195121100"},{"name":"Wenjun Zeng","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37286472700"},{"name":"Jun Tian","affiliation":["Puturewei Technologies, Bridgewater, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Tian","id":"37896840100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5593-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4766"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4774"}],"articleNumber":"6707796","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":472},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Manganese","Abstracts","Encryption","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","cryptographic protocols","data privacy","image coding","image watermarking","multimedia databases","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy preserving storage","compressive sensing domain","secure watermark detection techniques","secrecy protection","cloud","privacy protection","multimedia data storage","CS based framework","secure multiparty computation protocols","MPC protocols","secret watermark pattern","compressive sensing transformation","semihonest security model","compressive sensing matrix","watermark detection performance","collaborative secure signal processing","data-mining applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","secure watermark detection","secure signal processing","secure multiparty computation","privacy preserving"]}],"abstract":"Secure watermark detection techniques are important to protect the secrecy of the watermark pattern. In this paper, we identify an application scenario that requires performing secure watermark detection in the cloud, and in the meantime, supporting privacy preserving multimedia data storage using the cloud. We then propose a compressive sensing (CS) based framework using secure multiparty computation (MPC) protocols to address such a requirement. In our framework, the multimedia data and secret watermark pattern are presented to the cloud for secure watermark detection in a compressive sensing domain to protect the privacy. The compressive sensing transformation is executed by a MPC protocol under the semi-honest security model to protect the privacy of the compressive sensing matrix and the watermark pattern. We derive the lower bound of the expected watermark detection performance in the compressive sensing domain, given the original image, watermark pattern and only the size of the compressive sensing matrix. The lower bound has been validated by our experiments. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that secure watermark detection in the compressive sensing domain is feasible. Our framework can also be extended to other collaborative secure signal processing and data-mining applications in the cloud.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Integrated secure watermark detection and privacy preserving storage in the compressive sensing domain","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","doi":"10.1109/WIFS.2013.6707796","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693295/6707777/06707796.pdf","startPage":"67","endPage":"72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIFS.2013.6707796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707777","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707796","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707796/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Integrated secure watermark detection and privacy preserving storage in the compressive sensing domain","conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707796/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14028187","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrated secure watermark detection and privacy preserving storage in the compressive sensing domain","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"00067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106508S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693295","isNumber":"6707777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693295","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6707777","articleId":"6707796","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707809,"authors":[{"name":"Khosro Bahrami","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronic Engineering School, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Khosro","lastName":"Bahrami","id":"37699042000"},{"name":"Alex C.

Firstly, the blur kernels of image blocks (local blur kernels) are estimated. Next, a multi-step reblurring technique is used to measure the relative blur degrees of the local blur kernels. The relative blur degrees are used as a feature to classify the image blocks based on the blur degrees. Furthermore, block-based and pixel-based techniques are incorporated for a fine segmentation of the regions with different blur degrees. Finally, the consistency in the blur degree and depth information of the regions are analyzed. Any inconsistency in the blur degree and depth information can be used as an evidence of image splicing. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can discriminate a wide range of blur degrees in natural and artificial blurred images which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, our proposed approach has been evaluated for image splicing detection. The result shows that it can be used successfully for detection of image splicing.","doi":"10.1109/WIFS.2013.6707809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WIFS.2013.6707809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707777","startPage":"144","endPage":"149","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6693295/6707777/06707809.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Workshop on Information Forensics and Security (WIFS)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707809","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Splicing","Kernel","Image segmentation","Forgery","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multistep reblurring technique","relative blur degrees","image block classification","block-based technique","pixel-based technique","natural blurred image","artificial blurred image","image segmentation","local blur kernels","depth information","image splicing detection","out-of-focus blurred images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Splicing detection in out-of-focus blurred images","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Nov. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-21 Nov. 2013","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14028167","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6707809/","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707809/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Splicing detection in out-of-focus blurred images","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"00144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069121S","chronDate":"18-21 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6693295","isNumber":"6707777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6693295","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6707777","articleId":"6707809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6707826,"authors":[{"name":"Yutao Zhu","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yutao","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38107314700"},{"name":"Tian Kang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Kang","id":"38529231300"},{"name":"Tiankui Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiankui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288850400"},{"name":"Zhimin Zeng","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Network System Architecture and Convergence, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhimin","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37288929900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0122-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707826","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":455},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Telecommunication traffic","Switches","Power demand","Load modeling","Conferences","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","energy conservation","heuristic programming","iterative methods","matrix algebra","optimisation","quality of service","telecommunication power management","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS-aware user association","cell zooming","energy efficiency","cellular networks","traffic load variation","energy saving","sleep mode","quality of service","QoS","UAS","cell association","optimization problem","user association matrix","network weight matrix","heuristic iteration algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["energy efficiency","user association","cell zooming"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707826","abstract":"In cellular networks, cell zooming with the variation of the traffic load is considered as one of promising technologies for energy saving.

In this paper, based on the cell zooming, we propose a quality of service (QoS) aware user association scheme (UAS) to reconfigure the cell association for energy saving. In the UAS, we consider the tradeoff between QoS guarantee and energy saving of the networks. The optimization problem of UAS is derived from the network weight matrix and user association matrix. A heuristic iteration algorithm is provided to solve this optimization problem, and then the cells without associated users can be turned off for energy saving. Simulation results show that the proposed UAS can significantly reduce energy consumption and improve the energy efficiency without degrading QoS, especially under the low traffic load.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707826","startPage":"6","endPage":"10","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6698268/6707820/06707826.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-aware user association based on cell zooming for energy efficiency in cellular networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"QoS-aware user association based on cell zooming for energy efficiency in cellular networks","conferenceDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707826/","accessionNumber":"14029889","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707826/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-aware user association based on cell zooming for energy efficiency in cellular networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p6zhu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066001S","chronDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6698268","isNumber":"6707820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6698268","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6707820","articleId":"6707826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707827,"authors":[{"name":"Vineeth S Varma","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Issy Les Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Vineeth S","lastName":"Varma","id":"38524583200"},{"name":"Salah Eddine Elayoubi","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Issy Les Moulineaux, France"],"firstName":"Salah Eddine","lastName":"Elayoubi","id":"37282413700"},{"name":"Merouane Debbah","affiliation":["Alcatel Lucent Chair, SUPELEC, Gif sur Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Merouane","lastName":"Debbah","id":"37284195000"},{"name":"Samson Lasaulce","affiliation":["LSS, SUPELEC, Gif sur Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Samson","lastName":"Lasaulce","id":"37284485800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0122-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707827","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Measurement","Interference","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio links","receiving antennas","telecommunication power management","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual MIMO system","sleep mode","power level strategy","small cell cluster","virtual multiple input multiple output","base station","receiving antenna","downlink energy efficiency metric","sleep mode scheme","zero-forcing scheme","OFDMA","transmitting antenna"]}],"abstract":"The major motivation behind this work is to optimize the sleep mode and transmit power level strategies in a small cell cluster in order to maximize the proposed energy efficiency metric.

For WUSNs, the goal is to establish an efficient wireless communication in the underground medium. A magnetic induction (MI) based transmission technique was proposed to overcome the very harsh conditions of the soil environment. In this paper, we investigate the potential of the MI-WUSNs if, in contrast to some previous proposals, no relays are used. Our main focus is on the throughput of the bottleneck link of the network, which corresponds to the overall network capacity. In order to reduce the number of relevant interferers and maximize the network throughput, we exploit the polarization of the used magnetic antennas (coils) by optimizing their orientation. Additional optimization of the system parameters improves the channel capacity of the bottleneck link. In addition, we consider a special case of the network deployment in mines and tunnels and propose a frequency switching scheme for better propagation conditions.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707839","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6698268/6707820/06707839.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707839","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","startPage":"71","endPage":"75","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference polarization in magnetic induction based Wireless Underground Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Interference polarization in magnetic induction based Wireless Underground Sensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707839/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707839/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029896","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference polarization in magnetic induction based Wireless Underground Sensor Networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p71kisseleff.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056198S","chronDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6698268","isNumber":"6707820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6698268","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6707820","articleId":"6707839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707847,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Galindo-Serrano","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Galindo-Serrano","id":"38277739800"},{"name":"Lorenza Giupponi","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Lorenza","lastName":"Giupponi","id":"37281677900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0122-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707847","dbTime":"34 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Interference","Macrocell networks","Signal to noise ratio","Interpolation","OFDM","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["femtocellular radio","learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov processes","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organized femto-to-macro interference coordination","intercell interference coordination","femtocell","3GPP Releases 10","distributed learning approach","reinforcement learning","RL","partially observable Markov decision process","POMDP","spatial interpolation theory","macrouser","transmission power policy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell network","interference management","multiagent system","POMDP","spatial interpolation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a self-organized method for Intercell Interference Coordination (ICIC) between femto and macro layers.

We propose a distributed learning approach, based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), for environments characterized by partial information, due to the lack of communication between femtos and macros. The theory behind this approach is funded in the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The POMDP requires to construct a set of beliefs about the environment. These beliefs are constructed following the spatial Interpolation theory, which allows to estimate the interference perceived by the macrousers. Simulation results show that, through the proposed methodology, femtocells can autonomously learn a transmission power policy to manage the aggregated interference at macrousers.

At the same time there are other spectrum usage authorization models for wireless communication, such as unlicensed spectrum or, as widely discussed currently but not yet implemented in practice, various forms of licensed shared spectrum. Hence, cellular technology as of today can only operate in a subset of the spectrum that is in principle available. Hence, a future wireless system may benefit from the ability to access also spectrum opportunities other than dedicated licensed spectrum. It is therefore important to identify which additional ways of authorizing spectrum usage are deemed to become relevant in the future and to analyze the resulting technical requirements. The implications of sharing spectrum between different technologies are analyzed in this paper, both from efficiency and technology neutrality perspective. Different known sharing techniques are outlined and their applicability to the relevant range of future spectrum regulatory regimes is discussed. Based on an assumed range of relevant (according to the views of the authors) future spectrum sharing scenarios, a toolbox of certain spectrum sharing techniques is proposed as the basis for the design of spectrum sharing related functionality in future mobile broadband systems.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707850","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6698268/6707820/06707850.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707820","startPage":"127","endPage":"132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sharing scenarios and resulting technical requirements for 5G systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707850","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sharing scenarios and resulting technical requirements for 5G systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707850/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029908","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6707850/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sharing scenarios and resulting technical requirements for 5G systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p127irnich.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044776S","chronDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6698268","isNumber":"6707820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6698268","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"6707820","articleId":"6707850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707855,"authors":[{"name":"B.

We assume also that the stations may have varying parameters of, for example, the link layer performance (SINR threshold, etc). By studying the propagation processes of signals received by the typical user from all antennas marked by the corresponding antenna parameters, we show that seemingly different heterogeneous networks based on Poisson point processes can be equivalent from the point of view a typical user. These neworks can be replaced with a model where all the previously varying propagation parameters (including path-loss exponents) are set to constants while the only trade-off being the introduction of an isotropic base station density. This allows one to perform analytic comparisons of different network models via their isotropic representations. In the case of a constant path-loss exponent, the isotropic representation simplifies to a homogeneous modification of the constant intensity of the original network, thus generalizing a previous result showing that the propagation processes only depend on one moment of the emitted power and propagation effects. We give examples and applications to motivate these results and highlight an interesting observation regarding random path-loss exponents.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equivalence and comparison of heterogeneous cellular networks","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","doi":"10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707855","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6698268/6707820/06707855.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707820","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707855","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707855/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Equivalence and comparison of heterogeneous cellular networks","conferenceDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707855/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029900","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equivalence and comparison of heterogeneous cellular networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p153blaszczyszyn.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078172S","chronDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6698268","isNumber":"6707820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6698268","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6707820","articleId":"6707855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6707858,"authors":[{"name":"Jiamo Jiang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiamo","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38521006700"},{"name":"Mugen Peng","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Mugen","lastName":"Peng","id":"37269684700"},{"name":"Kecheng Zhang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kecheng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085361451"},{"name":"Lei Li","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Laboratory Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Li","id":"37085354098"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0122-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707858","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":456},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Optimization","Interference constraints","Power demand","Quality of service","Iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","energy conservation","interference","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","power consumption","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient resource allocation problem","heterogeneous network","cross-tier interference constraint","HetNet","power consumption","green communications","nonconvex optimization problem","minimum data rate requirement","practical power model","iterative algorithm","dual decomposition method","pico base station","quality of service requirement","macro users","transmit power consumption"]}],"abstract":"Heterogeneous network (HetNet) has been investigated as a promising technique for enhancing the coverage and reducing the transmit power consumption, which has emerged as a candidate for green communications.

The problem is transformed into an equivalent form which can be solved by an iterative algorithm. The dual decomposition method is utilized in each iteration to obtain the closed-form solution for the optimal power and resource block allocation. The energy efficiency of the pico base station can be maximized by the proposed algorithm, although the constraint on the cross-tier interference restricts the transmit power on each resource block to fulfill the quality of service (QoS) requirement of the macro users.

From recent research and engineering efforts, achieving this goal relies on two promising technologies of cognitive radio (CR) to fully utilize the time-frequency domain radio resources, and stochastic geometry to capture physical distances among nodes (and thus the power domain radio resources). To fully exploit radio resources in all domains of time, frequency, and power, existing schemes impose a strong assumption on the availability of node densities for autonomous resource allocations. To practically validate this assumption, femtocells need to estimate densities of femtocell base stations. However, subject to limited coverage ranges of femtocells, each femtocell can only acquire limited samples insufficient for an accurate estimation. As a result, femtocells need to cooperate with each other. One possible cooperation scheme is selecting a femtocell as fusion center to collect partial information of node densities from all femtocells. This scheme is, however, vulnerable to the fusion center failure and is costly. To provide a robust and efficient scheme, in this paper, we integrate technical merits of CR and stochastic geometry to propose a stochastic network topology cognition framework for femtocells. Our scheme adopts a local processes/estimations of partial information to achieve a competitive performance as compared with that of a unrealistic fusion center, to practically enable a full radio resource utilization in all domains.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707820","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707863","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6698268/6707820/06707863.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"199","doi":"10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707863","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic topology cognition in heterogeneous networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic topology cognition in heterogeneous networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6707863/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029886","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707863/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic topology cognition in heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p194hung.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115224S","chronDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6698268","isNumber":"6707820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6698268","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6707820","articleId":"6707863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6707866,"authors":[{"name":"Shinobu Nanba","affiliation":["KDDI R&D Laboratories Inc., Fujimino-shi, Saitama, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Shinobu","lastName":"Nanba","id":"37284433700"},{"name":"Akira Agata","affiliation":["KDDI R&D Laboratories Inc., Fujimino-shi, Saitama, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Agata","id":"37281604800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0122-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707866","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":11,"totalDownloads":1415},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data compression","Bit rate","Baseband","Computer architecture","Mobile communication","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","mobile computing","optical fibres","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile data traffic","performance evaluation","common lossless audio compression scheme","bit width reduction","compression ratio","CPRI protocol","optical fibers","RRH","remote radio heads","BBU","baseband units","C-RAN","centralized-RAN","front-haul link","IQ data compression scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Centralized-RAN","IQ data compression","compression ratio","IQ bit width","FLAC"]}],"abstract":"In the Centralized-RAN (C-RAN), some baseband units (BBUs) are centralized in the same location, which is typically less than 20 km away from remote radio heads (RRHs) locally distributed.

By applying the proposed scheme to the front-haul link, the installation cost of optical fibers can be reduced by half.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707866","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6698268/6707820/06707866.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new IQ data compression scheme for front-haul link in Centralized RAN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707866","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707866/","displayDocTitle":"A new IQ data compression scheme for front-haul link in Centralized RAN","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029871","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707866/","conferenceDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new IQ data compression scheme for front-haul link in Centralized RAN","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p210nanba.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070046S","chronDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6698268","isNumber":"6707820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6698268","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6707820","articleId":"6707866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6707867,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Jin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology"],"firstName":"Jin","lastName":"Jin","id":"37085584638"},{"name":"Xiangchuan Gao","affiliation":["Zhengzhou University"],"firstName":"Xiangchuan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37596006600"},{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086777415"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0122-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707867","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antennas","Interference","MIMO","Transceivers","Closed-form solutions","Downlink","Macrocell networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","iterative methods","MIMO communication","picocellular radio","radio links","radio spectrum management","radio transceivers","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference alignment scheme","downlink MIMO heterogeneous network","HetNet","picocellular radio","radio spectrum management","macrocellular radio","multiple-input multiple-output network","degrees of freedom","DoF","data streaming","minimum antenna utilization constraint","zero-forcing based transceiver design","IA","iterative computation","CSI feedback overhead"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interference alignment","heterogeneous network","transceiver design","antenna resources"]}],"abstract":"We consider a downlink heterogeneous network (HetNet), where several picocells coexist in the same spectrum as a macrocell. For a general framework of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network consisting of arbitrary number of picocells and macro users within the macrocell, designing a closed-form solution to achieve the degrees of freedom (DoF) of (C + K)d while guaranteeing the minimum overall antenna usage is an open problem, where C, K and d are the number of picocells, marco users within the macro cell and data streams per user, respectively. Therefore, by relaxing the minimum antenna utilization constraint, we present a zero-forcing based transceiver design at first, which outperforms the existing closed-form solution based on interference alignment (IA) in terms of antenna usage in most cases. That is to say, alignment processing is not necessary in most cases for the existing scheme because simple zero-forcing scheme with efficient antenna utilization can also attain the same DoF. Besides, we propose two IA schemes without any iterative computations, which have the same antenna configuration but different CSI feedback overhead. Also, our proposed IA schemes require lower usage of antennas compared to the zero-forcing scheme and existing IA scheme.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707867","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6698268/6707820/06707867.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New interference alignment schemes for downlink MIMO heterogeneous networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707867/","displayDocTitle":"New interference alignment schemes for downlink MIMO heterogeneous networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029907","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6707867/","conferenceDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New interference alignment schemes for downlink MIMO heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p215jin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055825S","chronDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6698268","isNumber":"6707820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6698268","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6707820","articleId":"6707867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6707868,"authors":[{"name":"Jarkko Kaleva","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarkko","lastName":"Kaleva","id":"38229960800"},{"name":"Antti T\u00f6lli","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"T\u00f6lli","id":"37284723300"},{"name":"Markku Juntti","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Juntti","id":"37269762200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0122-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6707868","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Convergence","MIMO","Receivers","Quality of service","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","broadcast channels","convex programming","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","minimisation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weighted sum rate maximization","decentralized beamformer design","specific rate constraints","multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel","MIMO-BC","transmit beamformer generation","receive beamformer generation","successive convex approximation","mean-squared error minimization","MSE minimization","spatial data stream specific weighting factors","inter-stream interference costs","Lagrangian relaxation","TDD based systems","over-the-air signaling overhead"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6707868","doi":"10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707868","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","abstract":"A novel decentralized beamformer design for weighted sum rate maximization with user specific rate constraints is proposed for interfering multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel (BC). In order to reduce the inherent complexity of the rate maximizing beamformer design, alternating receive and transmit beamformer generation together with successive convex approximation are applied. The rate maximization problem is reduced to mean-squared error (MSE) minimization with spatial data stream specific weighting factors that imply the inter-stream interference costs, where the weights depend additionally on the violation of the rate constraints. The iterative process is based on the Lagrangian relaxation of the rate constraints, and, thus, each intermediate beamformer solution is not required to be strictly feasible in terms of the rate constraints but rather steers the algorithm towards a solution with feasible rate constraints. Exchange of the weighting factors among the adjacent cells provides decentralized problem formulation for TDD based systems with a very low over-the-air signaling overhead.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRCW.2013.6707868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707820","startPage":"220","endPage":"224","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC Workshops)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6698268/6707820/06707868.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized beamforming for weighted sum rate maximization with rate constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6707868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6707868/","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized beamforming for weighted sum rate maximization with rate constraints","conferenceDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14029870","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decentralized beamforming for weighted sum rate maximization with rate constraints","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"p220kaleva.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077419S","chronDate":"8-9 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6698268","isNumber":"6707820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6698268","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6707820","articleId":"6707868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6707898,"authors":[{"name":"Amir H.

In this work, we explore a novel Low-dimensional Manifold Learning (LDML) approach to overcome high dimensional search space of human model. Low-dimensional demonstration not only delivers a compact tractable search space, but it is efficient to capture general human pose variations. The key contribution of this work is an algorithm of Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) for pose optimization in latent space of human motion. Firstly, we learn the human motion model in low-dimensional latent space using nonlinear dimension reduction technique charting based on hierarchical strategy. Increased dependence provision is carried out using hierarchy strategic measures in charting, which improves accuracy in higher flexibility and adaptation. Then we applied QPSO algorithm to estimate the human poses in low-dimensional latent space. Preliminary experimental tracking results show that our approach is able to give good accuracy as compared to conventional state-of-the-arts methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6708014/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026757","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Human pose tracking in low-dimensional subspace using manifold learning by charting","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Human pose tracking in low-dimensional subspace using manifold learning by charting","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"48Day2OTM24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067245S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690583","isNumber":"6707955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690583","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6707955","articleId":"6708014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6708016,"authors":[{"name":"Husam Ahmed Al Hamad","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Qassim University, Qassim, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Husam Ahmed","lastName":"Al Hamad","id":"37085721549"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0269-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0267-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6708016","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708016","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Training","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Accuracy","Mathematical model","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["handwriting recognition","image fusion","image recognition","image segmentation","natural language processing","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Arabic handwriting recognition","image recognition","image segmentation","artificial neural network","neural-segmentation","fusion equation","prospective segmentation points","PSP","CPU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Arabic recognition","segmentation","neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICSIPA.2013.6708016","endPage":"274","startPage":"269","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6690583/6707955/06708016.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIPA.2013.6708016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use an efficient neural network to improve the Arabic handwriting recognition","abstract":"Using an efficient neural network for recognition and segmentation will definitely improve the performance and accuracy of the results; in addition to reduce the efforts and costs.

Experiments that were performed of classifiers will be compared with each other and with the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708016/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6708016/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14026806","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Use an efficient neural network to improve the Arabic handwriting recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use an efficient neural network to improve the Arabic handwriting recognition","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"50Day2SCA11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123119S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690583","isNumber":"6707955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690583","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6707955","articleId":"6708016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6708018,"authors":[{"name":"Ismail M.

This paper proposes a new method to solve this problem. Unlike the published studies, in which the prediction of exons locations depends on hard decisions from a single classifier, the proposed prediction approach depends on fusion of soft decisions from two classifiers. In the proposed approach we utilize the sliding window discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which is normally used to detect exons 3-base periodicity feature, in a different manner. The novelty here depends on obtaining soft decisions, rather than hard decisions, from two classifiers using different numerical mapping schemes, and fuses them in a decision fusion center to obtain a final global decision about the prediction of exons locations. Simulation results based on real data performed on the HMR195 dataset showed that the proposed soft decisions fusion method achieves better prediction performance compared to the traditional hard decision single classifier method. Moreover the proposed method can easily be extended to more than two classifiers.","doi":"10.1109/ICSIPA.2013.6708018","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6690583/6707955/06708018.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIPA.2013.6708018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707955","startPage":"281","endPage":"286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new multiple classifiers soft decisions fusion approach for exons prediction in DNA sequences","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new multiple classifiers soft decisions fusion approach for exons prediction in DNA sequences","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708018/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026766","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6708018/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new multiple classifiers soft decisions fusion approach for exons prediction in DNA sequences","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"52Day2SCA13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076929S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690583","isNumber":"6707955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690583","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6707955","articleId":"6708018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6708020,"authors":[{"name":"Amar Mezache","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement d'Electronique, Universit\u00e9 de Constantine 1, Constantine, Algeria"],"firstName":"Amar","lastName":"Mezache","id":"37658855400"},{"name":"Izzeddine Chalabi","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement d'Electronique, Universit\u00e9 de M'sila,, M'sila, Algeria"],"firstName":"Izzeddine","lastName":"Chalabi","id":"37073615400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0269-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0267-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6708020","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Estimation","Clutter","Radar","Conferences","Image processing","Fitting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","Gaussian processes","genetic algorithms","inverse problems","iterative methods","mathematics computing","mean square error methods","neural nets","parameter estimation","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RiIG-distribution parameter estimation","Rician inverse Gaussian model parameters","inverse function","RiIG CDF","cumulative distributed function","ANN technique","artificial neural network technique","nonlinear complexity","recorded sea-clutter data","real CDF regressions","ANN estimator","genetic algorithm tool","GA tool","mean square error of estimate criterion","MSE criterion","probability density function","iterative maximum likelihood method estimator","IMLM estimator","real PDF"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708020","abstract":"In order to improve the estimation of the RiIG (Rician Inverse Gaussian) model parameters, the authors attempt to achieve the parameter estimates using the inverse function of the RiIG CDF (Cumulative Distributed Function) which the latter can not be obtained in a closed form.

It is shown that the purpose of improving the accuracy of parameter estimation is achieved by using the Hanning window which reduces the long-range leakage and by frequency domain interpolation which eliminates the short-range leakage. The sensitivity analysis of changing of the parameters, noise effect and sampling length show that, both the noise effect and spectrum interference are considered, proving the reliability and high accuracy parameter estimation in a number of engineering applications.

However, the communication quality is greatly compromised by the low resolution of the imaging sensor which produces blurred images of the LEDs at long distances. On the other hand, the images recorded at high frame rates possess particular features that can be used to improve the reception. This paper suggests image processing techniques to detect and decode the optical signals of an array of LEDs. For the case of blurred images, detection of the LED's is reinforced by a k-means clustering algorithm based on distance measurements derived from the linear correlation among pixel intensities along the time dimension. Experiments with a prototype show that the proposed algorithms can improve the bit error rate (BER) of the decoded signal. Furthermore, partial implementation on a General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) is also addressed, and processing times are demonstrated.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6690583/6707955/06708038.pdf","startPage":"384","endPage":"389","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications","doi":"10.1109/ICSIPA.2013.6708038","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIPA.2013.6708038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707955","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image processing techniques for high speed camera-based free-field optical communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Optical transmitters","Arrays","Image processing","Cameras","Optical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","graphics processing units","image processing","light emitting diodes","optical communication","optical signal detection","pattern clustering","video cameras"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing technique","high speed camera-based free-field optical communication","light-emitting diode","video camera","communication quality","imaging sensor","optical signal decoding","optical signal detection","LED array","k-means clustering algorithm","distance measurement","bit error rate","BER","general purpose graphics processing unit","GPGPU"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708038/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Image processing techniques for high speed camera-based free-field optical communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6708038/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026822","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image processing techniques for high speed camera-based free-field optical communication","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"72Day3INVSM12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077626S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690583","isNumber":"6707955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690583","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6707955","articleId":"6708038","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6708040,"authors":[{"name":"Housam Khalifa Bashier","affiliation":["Jalan Ayer Keroh Lama, Multimedia University, Melaka, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Housam Khalifa","lastName":"Bashier","id":"37061844500"},{"name":"Lau Siong Hoe","affiliation":["Multimedia University, Melaka, Melaka, MY"],"firstName":"Lau Siong","lastName":"Hoe","id":"37544360900"},{"name":"Pang Ying Han","affiliation":["Multimedia University, Melaka, Melaka, MY"],"firstName":"Pang Ying","lastName":"Han","id":"38647894500"},{"name":"Liew Yee Ping","affiliation":["Multimedia University, Melaka, Melaka, MY"],"firstName":"Liew Yee","lastName":"Ping","id":"37086716444"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0269-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0267-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6708040","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image recognition","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","face recognition","feature extraction","lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["novel illumination normalization algorithm","face recognition systems","local trapezoid feature","LTF","trapezoid rule","Yale face database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Local Trapezoid Feature","image processing","pattern recognition","Illumination variation","face recognition"]}],"abstract":"Face recognitions systems suffer from the problem associated with illumination variation.

That is in PSO; initially the populations are generated in random manner. Due to this random process, the population results may also be in random. Thus, it is not certain that this method will produce precise result. Hence to avoid this drawback, a modified face recognition method is proposed in this paper. Here, a new face recognition method based on Opposition based PSO with SVM (OPSO-SVM) is introduced. To accomplish the face recognition with our proposed OPSO-SVM, initially feature extraction process is carried out on the image database. In the feature extraction process, the efficient features are extracted and then given to the SVM training and testing process. In OPSO, the populations are generated in two ways: one is random population as same as the normal PSO technique and the other is opposition population, which is based on the random population values. The optimized parameters in SVM by OPSO efficiently perform the face recognition process. Two human face databases FERET and YALE are utilized to analyze the performance of our proposed OPSO-SVM technique and also this OPSO-SVM is compared with PSO-SVM and standard SVM techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708043/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14026775","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6708043/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Face recognition based on opposition particle swarm optimization and support vector machine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition based on opposition particle swarm optimization and support vector machine","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"78Day3ODRM25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091541S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690583","isNumber":"6707955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690583","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6707955","articleId":"6708043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6708044,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Lu","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, PLA University of Science & Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Lu","id":"38183969500"},{"name":"Bangning Zhang","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, PLA University of Science & Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bangning","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37069784500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0269-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-0267-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6708044","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":88},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Filtering","Particle swarm optimization","Signal to noise ratio","Conferences","Image processing","Communication symbols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","frequency modulation","interference (signal)","maximum likelihood estimation","particle filtering (numerical methods)","particle swarm optimisation","state-space methods","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single channel time-varying amplitude LFM interference blind separation","MHMPSO particle filtering","single channel blind signal separation","SCBSS problem","communication signal","Metropolis-Hastings mutation particle swarm optimized particle filtering","MHMPSOPF","maximum a posterior estimate","MAP estimate","communication code","state space model","interfered signal","resampling process","sequential estimation process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Single channel blind separation","LFM Interference","State space model","Mutation particle swarm optimized particle filtering","Intereference-Signal-Ratio"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708044","abstract":"A new approach is proposed for single channel blind signal separation(SCBSS) problem of communication signal and time-varying amplitude LFM interference based on Metropolis-Hastings mutation particle swarm optimized particle filtering (MHMPSOPF).

In literature, FFR has been analyzed mostly with cellular networks described by Hexagon Grid Model, which is neither tractable nor scalable to the dense deployment of next generation wireless networks. Moreover, the perfect geometry based grid model tends to overestimate the system performance and not able to reflect the reality. In this paper, we use the stochastic geometry approach, FFR is analyzed with cellular network modeled by homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP). A dynamic frequency allocation scheme is proposed which take into account the randomness of the cell coverage area describe by Voronoi tessellation.

Compressive sensing (CS) is a promising signal processing solution which can reduce the sampling requirements as well as avoid the narrowband interference (NBI) in UWB systems by utilizing the sparsity of the transmitted signal. In this paper, we investigate the BER performance for mitigation of multiple NBI in CS based UWB systems. Simulation shows that at high signal to interference ration (SIR), the performance enhances as the bandwidth of the NBI increases. As the UWB signal's bandwidth increases, the number of the notched measurements lessens and we preserve the important information about the transmitted pulse. Additionally, the bandwidth occupied by the NBI relative to the center frequency of the transmitted pulse determines the amount of the degradation in the performance. In addition, the paper studies the impact of the transmitted pulse shape.","doi":"10.1109/ICSIPA.2013.6708047","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE International Conference on Signal and Image Processing Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6690583/6707955/06708047.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSIPA.2013.6708047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707955","startPage":"441","endPage":"446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing for blind NBI mitigation in UWB systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing for blind NBI mitigation in UWB systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708047/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026812","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6708047/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing for blind NBI mitigation in UWB systems","confLoc":"Melaka, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"82Day3SPCM24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151949S","chronDate":"8-10 Oct. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6690583","isNumber":"6707955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6690583","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6707955","articleId":"6708047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6708048,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Its signalling load represents a main challenge for multi-carrier and multiuser systems, where its optimization is required. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) is a multi-carrier technique currently under consideration in several commercial standards, where the feedback over each one of its subcarriers induces a non-acceptable signalling load in the system. A tradeoff is obtained between the two conflicting objectives, where this paper studies the feedback effect and how it induces additional energy consumption in the system. Closed form expressions are obtained for the amount of wasted energy where the effect of all the involved parameters is shown.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-feedback tradeoff in the best-M OFDMA systems","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","doi":"10.1109/CAMAD.2013.6708088","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689791/6708074/06708088.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"57","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAD.2013.6708088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6708074","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Energy-feedback tradeoff in the best-M OFDMA systems","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6708088/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026281","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-feedback tradeoff in the best-M OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p53alyazidi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047504S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689791","isNumber":"6708074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689791","xplore-issue":"6708074","articleId":"6708088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":6708091,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios Stavridis","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications (IDCOM), The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Stavridis","id":"38260343100"},{"name":"Sandeep Narayanan","affiliation":["Center of Excellence for Research DEWS, University of L\u2019 Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Narayanan","id":"38490793500"},{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["Laboratory of Signals and Systems (L2S), UMR 8506 CNRS - SUPELEC - Univ Paris-Sud, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Di Renzo","id":"37391990500"},{"name":"Luis Alonso","affiliation":["Signal Theory and Communications Dept, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Alonso","id":"37268944200"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications (IDCOM), The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"},{"name":"Christos Verikoukis","affiliation":["Telecommunications Technological Center of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Verikoukis","id":"37272215400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4919-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-4865"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-4873"}],"articleNumber":"6708091","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","MIMO","Benchmark testing","Switches","Power demand","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","MIMO communication","modulation","quality of service","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-off algorithm","spatial modulation","rate adaptive base station","multiple-input multiple-output","channel state information","receiver","MIMO-CSIR","transmission modes","user terminals","quality-of-service","QoS","ergodic capacity","Shannon capacity"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a novel rate adaptive Base Station (BS) switch on-off algorithm that employs Spatial Modulation (SM) and traditional Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO). We consider a cluster of BSs and based on the required average data rate, our algorithm selects the most energy efficient scheme between SM and MIMO with only Channel State Information at the Receiver (MIMO-CSIR). In order to further increase the Energy Efficiency (EE) (in bits/J), we activate or deactivate BSs in conjunction to switching between different transmission modes (SM or MIMO-CSIR). In both cases, we ensure that the User Terminals (UTs) do not face a reduction in Quality-of-Service (QoS) in the sense of ergodic capacity. Using the fundamental limit of Shannon capacity and a BS power model, we show that the use of SM, in such an algorithm, offers significant EE improvements.

Data collection efficiency is of paramount importance as sensors are severe resource-constrained devices, and current protocol inefficiencies lead to significant packet loss. In this work, we minimize the necessary information sensors transmit by applying the compressed sensing principles. Moreover, missing information due to packet loss is efficiently recovered using the matrix completion theory. The performance evaluation shows that when these advanced signal processing techniques are jointly used, the reconstruction error is small for high compression ratios, and fairly high packet loss.

The modeling and design approach we follow considers two different dimensions, along with the corresponding constraints and properties that stem from each one of them: a) the two tier architecture, and b) the simultaneous support of both real-time and non-real time services with various and diverse Quality of Service (QoS) prerequisites. To treat the above problem under a common framework, network utility maximization theory is used, where each mobile user, either in a femtocell or in the macrocell, is associated with a properly defined QoS-aware utility function. To further mitigate the intercell and cross-tier interference and give higher priority to the macrocell users (MUs), the femtocell users (FUs) are also \u201cpenalized\u201d through a convex cost function with respect to uplink transmission power. Due to its nature, the overall resulting problem is formulated as a non-cooperative game, and is solved using the supermodularity theory towards determining a Nash equilibrium point. A distributed iterative algorithm is also proposed in order to obtain the game's equilibrium point. Finally, the operational effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated through modeling and simulation, while its superiority against other power control frameworks in two-tier femtocell networks proposed in the literature, is illustrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient uplink power control in multi-service two-tier femtocell networks via a game theoretic approach","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","doi":"10.1109/CAMAD.2013.6708098","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689791/6708074/06708098.pdf","startPage":"104","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAD.2013.6708098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6708074","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Efficient uplink power control in multi-service two-tier femtocell networks via a game theoretic approach","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6708098/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026293","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient uplink power control in multi-service two-tier femtocell networks via a game theoretic approach","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p104tsiropoulou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053944S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689791","isNumber":"6708074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689791","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6708074","articleId":"6708098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6708106,"authors":[{"name":"Xiping Wu","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Xiping","lastName":"Wu","id":"38490662900"},{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d'Electricit\u00e9 (SUPELEC), Gif-sur-Yvette (Paris), France"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Di Renzo","id":"37391990500"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4919-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-4865"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-4873"}],"articleNumber":"6708106","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Transmitting antennas","Throughput","MIMO","Estimation","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","MIMO communication","modulation","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot ratio","channel estimation","spatial modulation","single-stream multiple-input multiple-output technique","MIMO technique","transmit antenna","inter-channel interference","radio-frequency chain","multistream MIMO systems","MIMO channel","channel correlation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","pilot ratio","spatial modulation (SM)","single-stream","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"Spatial modulation (SM) is a single-stream multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique which only activates one transmit antenna at a time. Apart from the complete avoidance of inter-channel interference, SM also exhibits a great energy saving in the radio-frequency (RF) chain. However, in contrast to multi-stream MIMO systems, channel estimation (CE) for SM becomes a challenge since the MIMO channel cannot be estimated in one transmission step due to the single RF chain. Motivated by this fact, a novel CE scheme has been recently proposed which exploits the channel correlation and jointly estimates the channels for different transmit antennas. Without needing feedback, this new method achieves the same estimation period as multi-stream MIMO schemes. In this paper, a varying pilot ratio has been investigated in SM for both the conventional and the novel CE methods. Balancing the accuracy and the amount of data, an optimal pilot ratio can be achieved for the peak throughput. Simulation results present that the novel CE approach significantly outperforms the conventional method with a much lower optimal pilot ratio.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of pilot ratio on channel estimation for spatial modulation","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","doi":"10.1109/CAMAD.2013.6708106","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689791/6708074/06708106.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAD.2013.6708106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6708074","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708106","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708106/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Effect of pilot ratio on channel estimation for spatial modulation","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6708106/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026299","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of pilot ratio on channel estimation for spatial modulation","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p144wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065955S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689791","isNumber":"6708074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689791","xplore-issue":"6708074","articleId":"6708106","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6708108,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos Ntontin","affiliation":["Telecommunications Technological Centre of Catalonia (CTTC), Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Ntontin","id":"37712883700"},{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["L2S, University of Paris-Sud XI (UPS), Gif-sur-Yvette (Paris), France"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Di Renzo","id":"37391990500"},{"name":"Ana Perez-Neira","affiliation":["Telecommunications Technological Centre of Catalonia (CTTC), Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Ana","lastName":"Perez-Neira","id":"38273848200"},{"name":"Christos Verikoukis","affiliation":["Telecommunications Technological Centre of Catalonia (CTTC), Castelldefels, Spain"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Verikoukis","id":"37272215400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4919-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-4865"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-4873"}],"articleNumber":"6708108","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Receiving antennas","Gain","Euclidean distance","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","modulation","Monte Carlo methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space shift keying systems","closed-loop antenna subset selection","symbol error rate","Monte Carlo simulations","closed-loop scheme","open-loop SSK","signal-to-noise ratio region","transmit-diversity gains","energy gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spatial modulation","antenna selection","feedback channel"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708108","abstract":"In this paper, we provide a performance analysis of closed-loop antenna subset selection in Space Shift Keying (SSK) systems.

In addition, we provide the energy gain that the antenna selection scheme achieves over the open-loop SSK for a target SER.","doi":"10.1109/CAMAD.2013.6708108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAD.2013.6708108","startPage":"154","endPage":"158","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689791/6708074/06708108.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6708074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of antenna subset selection in Space Shift Keying systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of antenna subset selection in Space Shift Keying systems","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6708108/","accessionNumber":"14026295","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708108/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of antenna subset selection in Space Shift Keying systems","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p154ntontin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061095S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689791","isNumber":"6708074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689791","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6708074","articleId":"6708108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6708109,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Narayanan","affiliation":["University of L\u2019 Aquila, Center of Excellence for Research DEWS, L' Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Sandeep","lastName":"Narayanan","id":"38490793500"},{"name":"Athanasios Stavridis","affiliation":["The University of Edinburgh, Institute for Digital Communications (IDCOM), Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Stavridis","id":"38260343100"},{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["Laboratory of Signals and Systems (L2S), UMR 8506 CNRS-SUPELEC-Univ Paris-Sud, Gif-sur-Yvette (Paris), France"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Di Renzo","id":"37391990500"},{"name":"Fabio Graziosi","affiliation":["University of L\u2019 Aquila, Center of Excellence for Research DEWS, L' Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Graziosi","id":"37269560200"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["The University of Edinburgh, Institute for Digital Communications (IDCOM), Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-4919-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-4865"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-4873"}],"articleNumber":"6708109","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708109","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Demodulation","Protocols","MIMO","Wireless networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","demodulation","diversity reception","maximum likelihood estimation","Monte Carlo methods","protocols","radio networks","space-time block codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state-of-the-art relaying protocols","protocol outperforms","Monte Carlo simulations","error-aware maximum-likelihood demodulator","cooperative relay networks","time-instance","diversity-gain","relay nodes","wireless networks","energy-efficient protocol","distributed spatially-modulated space-time-block-codes"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a novel energy-efficient protocol, intended for wireless networks with large number of relay nodes, is proposed.

These systems would experience complex spectrum environment with multiple unknown coexisting cellular networks, which needs to be quickly adapted with cognitive radio techniques for rapid deployment. To this end, this paper proposes a spectrum awareness scheme considering initial spectrum sensing on RD-eNodeB, sensing using UE's measurement capability and the radio environment map (REM) during the roll-out and in-service phases of the system's operation. For the initial spectrum sensing, a novel scheme for detecting, classifying and measuring downlink signals from coexisting base stations with different radio access technologies (RATs) is presented, which is invulnerable to the noise uncertainty problem. Encouraging numerical results of effectively detecting and classifying coexisting UMTS signal and LTE signals with different physical layer identities have been obtained via simulation.","doi":"10.1109/CAMAD.2013.6708116","pdfPath":"/iel7/6689791/6708074/06708116.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"200","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","publicationTitle":"2013 IEEE 18th International Workshop on Computer Aided Modeling and Design of Communication Links and Networks (CAMAD)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMAD.2013.6708116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6708074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum awareness scheme of the rapidly deployable eNodeB for unexpected and temporary events","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum awareness scheme of the rapidly deployable eNodeB for unexpected and temporary events","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14026285","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6708116/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum awareness scheme of the rapidly deployable eNodeB for unexpected and temporary events","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p196cao.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049472S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689791","isNumber":"6708074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689791","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6708074","articleId":"6708116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6708117,"authors":[{"name":"Senthuran Arunthavanathan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Senthuran","lastName":"Arunthavanathan","id":"37085826138"},{"name":"Sithamparanathan Kandeepan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Sithamparanathan","lastName":"Kandeepan","id":"37294706400"},{"name":"Robin J.

Hence, we consider such a supplementary network operating as secondary user of the spectrum, which opportunistically utilizes the same spectral band as the incumbent regular network until the incumbent comes alive. When the incumbent network comes alive, it is important to vacate the corresponding spectral bands without interfering with its communications. In our work, we consider both the secondary and incumbent networks as LTE networks where the secondary network has an aerial base station with low altitude platform. In this paper, we propose a method to perform spectrum sensing at the aerial eNodeB for the secondary LTE network in order to detect the incumbent user equipments on ground to avoid interfering with them. A novel approach is presented to perform this task considering the 3GPP-LTE uplink transmission specifications. Moreover, we consider the energy based spectrum sensing for detecting the incumbent users on the ground by the aerial eNodeB, and extensive simulation results are presented in a Rice fading environment for the detection and the false alarm probabilities.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708117/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","accessionNumber":"14026284","htmlLink":"/document/6708117/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sensing and detection of incumbent-UEs in secondary-LTE based aerial-terrestrial networks for disaster recovery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sensing and detection of incumbent-UEs in secondary-LTE based aerial-terrestrial networks for disaster recovery","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p201arunthavanathan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072209S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689791","isNumber":"6708074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689791","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"6708074","articleId":"6708117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6708119,"authors":[{"name":"\u00c9verton A.

Clear channel assessment (CCA) mechanisms for CSMA-based Alamouti networks are also investigated regarding their impact on spatial reuse and throughput. Simulations of Alamouti-equipped IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks are showcased under topologies not fully-connected. The obtained results indicate that throughput gains may be achieved when CCA is based on the average energy received across all antennas, in which case robustness to errors is balanced with spatial reuse.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6708119/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2013","accessionNumber":"14026275","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An approach for discrete-event simulations of alamouti scheme in ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach for discrete-event simulations of alamouti scheme in ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"p212andrade.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057836S","chronDate":"25-27 Sept. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6689791","isNumber":"6708074","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6689791","xplore-issue":"6708074","articleId":"6708119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6708128,"authors":[{"name":"Bonik Koo","affiliation":["Agency for Defense Development, Inha University, Korea"],"firstName":"Bonik","lastName":"Koo","id":"38268548200"},{"name":"Daeyoung Park","affiliation":["Inha University, School of Information and Communication Engineering, Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Daeyoung","lastName":"Park","id":"37275454300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6708128","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1322},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper investigates simultaneous transfer of information and energy over wireless link in the multiuser MIMO systems in which interference is aligned at the reduced signal subspace at each receiver.

In this letter, we propose a new method that uses NNs trained on the active constellation extension (ACE) signals to reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals.

To avoid high interference to the scheduled macrocell users (MUs), femtocell base stations (BSs) sense and access the channel opportunistically. When massive MIMO is deployed at macrocell BS, we find that this cognitive behavior forms too many guard zones scattered over macrocell's coverage area and seriously degrades spatial reuse efficiency. In this work, we consider not only the inter-user channel orthogonality, but also geographic locations for massive MIMO user scheduling in cognitive two-tier networks. We propose to choose MUs not far from each other as receivers of the macrocell's downlink spatial multiplexing streams, such that guard zones can be aligned spatially and more SR opportunities can be provided to femtocells. Simulations show that our scheme can significantly improve femto-tier throughput while only slightly sacrificing macro-tier throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6747950/06708133.pdf","startPage":"229","endPage":"232","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.123113.131913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.123113.131913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708133","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aligning Guard Zones of Massive MIMO in Cognitive Femtocell Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","MIMO","Macrocell networks","Throughput","Fading","Multiuser detection","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","femtocellular radio","interference suppression","MIMO communication","radio direction-finding","radio receivers","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","scheduling","signal detection","space division multiplexing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["guard zone scattering alignment","cognitive femtocell network","spatial spectrum reuse improvement","SR","interference","MU","macrocell user","femtocell base station","BS","interuser channel","geographic locations","massive MIMO user scheduling","cognitive two-tier network","radio receiver","macrocell downlink spatial multiplexing stream"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","scheduling","massive MIMO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708133/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Aligning Guard Zones of Massive MIMO in Cognitive Femtocell Networks","volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6708133/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14128342","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aligning Guard Zones of Massive MIMO in Cognitive Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"229-cl1402-li.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047417S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6747950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6747950","articleId":"6708133","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6708134,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38468802400"},{"name":"Qian Yong","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Qian","lastName":"Yong","id":"37086630004"},{"name":"Jiayin Qin","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Jiayin","lastName":"Qin","id":"37272689000"},{"name":"A.

An example has been shown that in the time domain, if a minimum of three channel impulse responses (CIRs) out of a total of nine CIRs have at least two significant taps while the other CIRs only have one significant tap, the CJ-3U-IA scheme is still feasible.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Feasibility of the CJ Three-User Interference Alignment Scheme for SISO OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.123113.132440","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6747950/06708134.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.123113.132440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708134/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","displayDocTitle":"On the Feasibility of the CJ Three-User Interference Alignment Scheme for SISO OFDM Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6708134/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2014","publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14128311","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Feasibility of the CJ Three-User Interference Alignment Scheme for SISO OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"309-cl1402-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057113S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6747950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6747950","articleId":"6708134","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6708135,"authors":[{"name":"Tian Xia","affiliation":["Louisiana State University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Xia","id":"38547024900"},{"name":"Hsiao-Chun Wu","affiliation":["Louisiana State University, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Chun","lastName":"Wu","id":"37292236100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6708135","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":465},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708135","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Synchronization","Delay effects","Joints","Transmitters","Receivers","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","parity check codes","phase shift keying","probability","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint blind frame synchronization algorithm","encoder identification scheme","low-density parity-check codes","LDPC codes","binary phase-shift keyed signals","log-likelihood ratios","a posteriori probability","APP","two-stage search method","quasi-cyclic nature","parity-check matrix","Monte Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind encoder identification","blind frame synchronization","LDPC codes","multi-path channels"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the problem involving joint blind frame synchronization and encoder identification for binary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes of binary phase-shift keyed (BPSK) signals is tackled.

Also, the average feedback overhead is evaluated. Both analytical and numerical results show that no matter whether the channel state information (CSI) knowledge of the interference links is perfect or not, the proposed scheme incurs extremely low signaling overhead to achieve almost the same outage performance with that of the centralized scheme.

But the complexity of the conventional sphere decoder is still high, where the candidates in a target sphere are enumerated and the radius is decreased gradually until no available candidate is in the sphere. In order to reduce the complexity of SD, a stack SD (SSD) algorithm with an efficient enumeration is proposed in this paper. Based on a novel path metric, SSD can effectively narrow the search range when enumerating the candidates within a sphere. The proposed metric follows an exact ML rule and takes the full usage of the whole received sequence. Furthermore, another very simple metric is provided as an approximation of the ML metric in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. For short polar codes, simulation results over the additive white Gaussian noise channels show that the complexity of SSD based on the proposed metrics is up to 100 times lower than that of the conventional SD.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.010214.131826","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6747950/06708139.pdf","startPage":"332","endPage":"335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.010214.131826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Sphere Decoding of Polar Codes Based on Optimum Path Metric","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Sphere Decoding of Polar Codes Based on Optimum Path Metric","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6708139/","accessionNumber":"14128303","volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"February 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Sphere Decoding of Polar Codes Based on Optimum Path Metric","sourcePdf":"332-cl1402-niu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038289S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6747950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6747950","articleId":"6708139","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":6708140,"authors":[{"name":"Miroslav Hekrdla","affiliation":["Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Miroslav","lastName":"Hekrdla","id":"37936908100"},{"name":"Jan Sykora","affiliation":["Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Sykora","id":"37284752600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6708140","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":414},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network coding","Constellation diagram","Lattices","Adaptive systems","Relays","Artificial intelligence","Indexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network coding","quadrature amplitude modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hexagonal constellation","adaptive physical-layer network coding 2-way relaying","wireless 2-way relay channel","4QAM constellation","extended-cardinality network coding adaptation","multiple-access stage","4-ary constellation","hexagonal lattice","MA stage","3HEX constellation","7HEX constellation","4HEX constellation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical-layer network coding","constellation design","wireless two-way relaying"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708140","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.122713.132526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.122713.132526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747950","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6747950/06708140.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hexagonal Constellations for Adaptive Physical-Layer Network Coding 2-Way Relaying","abstract":"We focus on a constellation design for adaptive physical-layer network coding strategy in a wireless 2-way relay channel.

As a reward, the secondary system will be granted to use the remained subcarriers to transmit its own signal in both two phases. We study the joint optimization of subcarriers and power allocation in both two phases such that the transmission rate of the secondary system is maximized while the primary system can achieve its target transmission rate. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed spectrum sharing protocol as well as its benefit to both primary and secondary system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing Based on Full-Duplex Cooperative OFDM Relaying","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2013.122713.132038","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6747950/06708142.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2013.122713.132038","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6747950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708142/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"February  2014","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing Based on Full-Duplex Cooperative OFDM Relaying","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6708142/","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2014","publicationDate":"February 2014","accessionNumber":"14128339","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Spectrum Sharing Based on Full-Duplex Cooperative OFDM Relaying","sourcePdf":"241-cl1402-lu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058017S","chronDate":"February  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"6747950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6747950","articleId":"6708142","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6708144,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086766704"},{"name":"Yuhan Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Yuhan","lastName":"Dong","id":"37086106580"},{"name":"Xuedan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Xuedan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086653374"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5239-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5237-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5238-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6708144","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Optical polarization","Bandwidth","Adaptive optics","Optical modulation","Optical fiber communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","OFDM modulation","optical communication","optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OOK scheme","on-off keying scheme","DCO-OFDM","power efficiency","PolSK","polarized OFDM scheme","polarization shift keying","high data rate wireless optical communication","ACO-OFDM modulation scheme","asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM","DC biased optical OFDM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","PolSK","wireless optical communications"]}],"abstract":"DC biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) and asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) modulation schemes can be used for high data rate wireless optical communications.

It is due to their unique merits such as high efficiency, fast dynamic response, and low cost. However, considering the major requirements for traction applications such as high torque and power density, low torque ripple, wide speed range, proper size, and capability of meeting a specific torque envelope, this machine is still under investigation to be developed for traction applications. Since the choice of motor for traction is generally determined by manufacturers with respect to three dominant factors: cost, weight, and size, the SynRM can be considered a strong alternative due to its high efficiency and lower cost. Hence, the machine's proper size estimation is a major step of the design process before attempting the rotor geometry design. This is crucial in passenger vehicles in which compactness is a requirement and the size and weight are indeed the design limitations. This paper presents a methodology for sizing a SynRM. The electric and magnetic parameters of the proposed machine in conjunction with the core dimensions are calculated. Then, the proposed method's validity and evaluation are done using FE analysis.","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2014.2299235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/6783703/06708422.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2014.2299235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6783703","startPage":"329","endPage":"340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sizing Methodology of the Synchronous Reluctance Motor for Traction Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708422","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Sizing Methodology of the Synchronous Reluctance Motor for Traction Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708422/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14219994","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6708422/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sizing Methodology of the Synchronous Reluctance Motor for Traction Applications","sourcePdf":"jestpe-pillay-2299235-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086289S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"6783703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"97","xplore-issue":"6783703","articleId":"6708422","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6708430,"authors":[{"name":"Serkan Dusmez","affiliation":["Power Electronics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Serkan","lastName":"Dusmez","id":"37892379600"},{"name":"Alireza Khaligh","affiliation":["Power Electronics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Khaligh","id":"37297731800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-3203"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0050"}],"articleNumber":"6708430","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2208},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-smc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ies/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Propulsion","Fuzzy logic","Energy management","Energy storage","Electric vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery powered vehicles","electric propulsion","energy management systems","fuzzy control","hybrid electric vehicles","optimisation","power transmission (mechanical)","static electrification","supercapacitors","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["supervisory power splitting approach","ultracapacitor-battery vehicle","propulsion machine","electrification","deceleration","fuzzy logic","supervisory wavelet transform","frequency decoupling-based energy management strategy","powertrain","hybrid battery-ultracapacitor ESS","transient free power","state of charge","SOC","torque demand","unconstrained optimization problem","energy-power decoupling strategy","power density","battery lifetime","energy storage system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric vehicles","energy management","energy storage system (ESS)","fuzzy logic","load sharing","ultracapacitor (UC)","wavelet transform (WT)"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Supervisory Power-Splitting Approach for a New Ultracapacitor\u2013Battery Vehicle Deploying Two Propulsion Machines","doi":"10.1109/TII.2014.2299237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6866288","endPage":"1971","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/6866288/06708430.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2014.2299237","startPage":"1960","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708430","abstract":"Electrification of performance vehicles brings several challenges, such as the necessity of high-power sources, which can satisfy the power requirements during acceleration and efficiently retrieve energy during deceleration without performance and life cycle deterioration of such sources. In addition, the limited space under the hood for these vehicles eliminates the possibility of utilizing large volume high-power propulsion machines. This paper proposes a fuzzy logic supervisory wavelet-transform frequency decoupling-based energy management strategy implemented on a new powertrain deploying two propulsion machines rated at different powers with a hybrid battery/ultracapacitor (UC) energy storage system (ESS). The proposed control and energy management strategy guarantees that battery and UC provide the base and transient-free powers, respectively, while state of charge (SOC) of UC is maintained at an optimal value. The torque demand is split among the propulsion machines by solving the formulated unconstrained optimization problem. With the proposed hybrid ESS and energy/power decoupling strategy, power density of the ESS can be increased, vehicle performance can be improved, and battery lifetime can be prolonged.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"10","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2014","accessionNumber":"14513568","htmlLink":"/document/6708430/","displayDocTitle":"A Supervisory Power-Splitting Approach for a New Ultracapacitor\u2013Battery Vehicle Deploying Two Propulsion Machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Supervisory Power-Splitting Approach for a New Ultracapacitor\u2013Battery Vehicle Deploying Two Propulsion Machines","sourcePdf":"tii-khaligh-2299237-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043596S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","isNumber":"6866288","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"97","articleId":"6708430","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6708434,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Can Fan","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology, State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Wuhan, P.R.

More specifically, when the states of an agent are not fully measurable, a measurement output is thus defined. As a typical example, the measurement output is defined as the position of an agent while its velocity is unmeasurable. We propose a measurement output feedback controller with a dynamic observer for the unmeasurable states. Moreover, the proposed controller with sufficiently large but explicitly designed gains is able to deal with system nonlinearities when the region of attraction is semi-globally specified.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/6861468/06708434.pdf","startPage":"2222","endPage":"2227","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2014.2299351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2014.2299351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6861468","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Global Consensus of Nonlinear Second-Order Multi-Agent Systems With Measurement Output Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-agent systems","Artificial neural networks","Trajectory","Output feedback","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Observers","Velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control nonlinearities","feedback","multi-agent systems","nonlinear control systems","observers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiglobal consensus","nonlinear second-order multiagent systems","leader-follower consensus control problem","agent states","measurement output feedback controller","dynamic observer","system nonlinearities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Consensus","cooperative control","nonlinear systems","output feedback"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708434/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Global Consensus of Nonlinear Second-Order Multi-Agent Systems With Measurement Output Feedback","volume":"59","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6708434/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14469439","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61322304 and 51328501"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP130103039"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Global Consensus of Nonlinear Second-Order Multi-Agent Systems With Measurement Output Feedback","sourcePdf":"tac-chen-2299351-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07321S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6861468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6861468","articleId":"6708434","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6708443,"authors":[{"name":"Yashan Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/6783703/6708443/hu-2299240-small.gif","p":["Yashan Hu received the B.Eng. and M.Sc. degrees in electronic and electrical engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.

Consequently, the full compensation of current unbalance can be achieved, by which both the current unbalance between two sets and current unbalance between phase windings in each set are eliminated. Meanwhile, the fifth and seventh current harmonics caused by nonsinusoidal back electromotive force and inverter nonlinearity can also be fully compensated. The effectiveness of proposed method is verified by a set of comparative experiments on a prototype dual three-phase PM machine system. It shows that fully balanced currents without the fifth and seventh current harmonics at the steady state of operation can be achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6708443/","dateOfInsertion":"04 April 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14210656","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Current Control for Dual Three-Phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors Accounting for Current Unbalance and Harmonics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current Control for Dual Three-Phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors Accounting for Current Unbalance and Harmonics","sourcePdf":"jestpe-hu-2299240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162855S","chronDate":"June  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"6783703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"6783703","articleId":"6708443","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":6708452,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00e9rome Euzi\u00e8re","affiliation":["Supelec, SONDRA, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"J\u00e9rome","lastName":"Euzi\u00e8re","id":"38498526200"},{"name":"R\u00e9gis Guinvarc'h","affiliation":["Supelec, SONDRA, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"R\u00e9gis","lastName":"Guinvarc'h","id":"37542250300"},{"name":"Bernard Uguen","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Institute of Rennes IETR, University of Rennes 1, Rennes, Brittany, France"],"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Uguen","id":"37265956500"},{"name":"Rapha\u00ebl Gillard","affiliation":["INSA of Rennes, Electronics and Telecommunications Institute of Rennes IETR, Rennes, Brittany, France"],"firstName":"Rapha\u00ebl","lastName":"Gillard","id":"37295953600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"6708452","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":798},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Interference","Radar applications","Chebyshev approximation","Antennas","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","genetic algorithms","interference suppression","radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse time-modulated array optimization","genetic algorithm","radar applications","STMA","radiation patterns","radar application","weighting coefficients","interference rejection","antenna arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antenna arrays","antenna patterns synthesis","genetic algorithm","radar","time modulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2014.2299285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2014.2299285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6719497","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/6719497/06708452.pdf","startPage":"161","endPage":"164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Sparse Time-Modulated Array by Genetic Algorithm for Radar Applications","abstract":"This letter investigates sparse time-modulated arrays (STMAs).

This paper proposes coordinated use of PV and battery energy storage (BES) to address voltage rise and/or dip problems. The reactive capability of PV inverter combined with droop-based BES system is evaluated for rural and urban scenarios (having different \\mbi R/X ratios). Results show that reactive compensation from PV inverters alone is sufficient to maintain acceptable voltage profile in an urban scenario (low-resistance feeder), whereas coordinated PV and BES support is required for the rural scenario (high-resistance feeder). Constant, as well as variable, droop-based BES schemes are analyzed. The required BES sizing and associated cost to maintain the acceptable voltage profile under both schemes are presented. Uncertainties in PV generation and load are considered, with probabilistic estimation of PV generation and randomness in load modeled to characterize the effective utilization of BES. Actual PV generation data and distribution system network data are used to verify the efficacy of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2014.2299336","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/6809862/06708466.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2014.2299336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6809862","startPage":"967","endPage":"977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Control of Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Reactive Power and Battery Energy Storage Systems to Improve the Voltage Profile of a Residential Distribution Feeder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708466","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Control of Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Reactive Power and Battery Energy Storage Systems to Improve the Voltage Profile of a Residential Distribution Feeder","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708466/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2014","accessionNumber":"14267610","dateOfInsertion":"02 May 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6708466/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordinated Control of Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Reactive Power and Battery Energy Storage Systems to Improve the Voltage Profile of a Residential Distribution Feeder","sourcePdf":"tii-mishra-2299336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080876S","chronDate":"May  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6809862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"234","xplore-issue":"6809862","articleId":"6708466","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6708467,"authors":[{"name":"Alenka G.

Through a simple intuitive analysis, the basic operation of the technique is explained. By mathematical analysis the optimum negative conductance value is derived and related to feedback theory. In- and out-of-band linearity, stability and Noise Figure are also analyzed. The technique is applied to linearize an RF receiver, and a prototype is implemented in 65 nm technology.

To ensure effectiveness of the massively distributed but relatively small-sized RAN caches, unlike Internet content delivery networks (CDNs) that can store millions of videos in a relatively few large-sized caches, we propose RAN-aware reactive and proactive caching policies that utilize User Preference Profiles (UPPs) of active users in a cell. Furthermore, we propose video-aware backhaul and wireless channel scheduling techniques that, in conjunction with edge caching, ensure maximizing the number of concurrent video sessions that can be supported by the end-to-end network while satisfying their initial delay requirements and minimize stalling. To evaluate our proposed techniques, we developed a statistical simulation framework using MATLAB and performed extensive simulations under various cache sizes, video popularity and UPP distributions, user dynamics, and wireless channel conditions. Our simulation results show that RAN caches using UPP-based caching policies, together with video-aware backhaul scheduling, can improve capacity by 300% compared to having no RAN caches, and by more than 50% compared to RAN caches using conventional caching policies. The results also demonstrate that using UPP-based RAN caches can significantly improve the probability that video requests experience low initial delays. In networks where the wireless channel bandwidth may be constrained, application of our video-aware wireless channel scheduler results in significantly (up to 250%) higher video capacity with very low stalling probability.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2013.2294111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6922183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2013.2294111","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/6922183/06708492.pdf","startPage":"1444","endPage":"1462","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Video-Aware Scheduling and Caching in the Radio Access Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"09 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Video-Aware Scheduling and Caching in the Radio Access Network","volume":"22","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6708492/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665381","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708492/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Video-Aware Scheduling and Caching in the Radio Access Network","sourcePdf":"tnet-ahlehagh-2294111-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127039S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6922183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"188","xplore-issue":"6922183","articleId":"6708492","onlineDate":"09 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6708495,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Esquius-Morote","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Laboratoire d'Electromagn\u00e9tisme et d'Acoustique (LEMA), Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503871/6716106/6708495/6708495-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marc Esquius-Morote (S'13) was born in Barcelona, Spain, in 1986.

In order to create a leaky-mode, the graphene surface reactance is sinusoidally modulated via graphene's field effect by applying adequate DC bias voltages to the different gating pads. The pointing angle and leakage rate can be dynamically controlled by adjusting the applied voltages, providing versatile beamscanning capabilities.

A small number of anomalous sensor readings, however, lead to misinterpretations and false conclusions. Hence, detecting and eliminating anomalies in sensor network deployments play a major role during the decision making process by assuring sensor data quality, integrity, and trustworthiness. A sensor network should be able to accurately identify malicious and faulty observations in a timely manner while maintaining a low communication overhead. In this work, we first perform an analysis of anomalies prevalent in sensor network deployments and then propose a distributed data-centric anomaly detection framework for sensor networks where each node in the collection tree is asked to maintain a statistical data summary over a specified period of time. Rather than transmitting raw sensory data, each node only communicates the behavioral summary to the base station. The base station, in turn, learns the behavior of each sensor node and instructs parent `intermediate' nodes in the tree to stop forwarding readings of misbehaving nodes. Given the summaries obtained from all sensor nodes, learning can be performed using existing machine learning techniques. We show that boosting is a good candidate for data classification in sensor networks over a short period of time compared to SVM.","doi":"10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514","publicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS 2012)","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Sensor Systems (MASS 2012)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6493538/6708501/06708514.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASS.2012.6708514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6708501","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-centric anomalies in sensor network deployments: analysis and detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708514","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Data-centric anomalies in sensor network deployments: analysis and detection","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Oct. 2012","xploreNote":"Due to a production error this article was mistakenly excluded from the original submission to Xplore.","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708514/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Oct. 2012","isConference":true,"volume":"Supplement","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"14040564","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6708514/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-centric anomalies in sensor network deployments: analysis and detection","confLoc":"Las Vegas, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"5-WSN9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098798S","chronDate":"8-11 Oct. 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6493538","isNumber":"6708501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6493538","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6708501","articleId":"6708514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6708549,"authors":[{"name":"Josep Miquel Jornet","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6704980/6708549/6708549-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Josep Miquel Jornet received the engineering degree in telecommunications engineering and the master of science in information and communication technologies from the Universitat Polit\u00e9cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain, in 2008.

For the time being, the size and power constraints of nano-devices limit the applicability of classical wireless communication in nanonetworks. Alternatively, nanomaterials can be used to enable electromagnetic (EM) communication among nano-devices. In this paper, a novel graphene-based nano-antenna, which exploits the behavior of Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) waves in semi-finite size Graphene Nanoribbons (GNRs), is proposed, modeled and analyzed. First, the conductivity of GNRs is analytically and numerically studied by starting from the Kubo formalism to capture the impact of the electron lateral confinement in GNRs. Second, the propagation of SPP waves in GNRs is analytically and numerically investigated, and the SPP wave vector and propagation length are computed. Finally, the nano-antenna is modeled as a resonant plasmonic cavity, and its frequency response is determined. The results show that, by exploiting the high mode compression factor of SPP waves in GNRs, graphene-based plasmonic nano-antennas are able to operate at much lower frequencies than their metallic counterparts, e.g., the Terahertz Band for a one-micrometer-long ten-nanometers-wide antenna. This result has the potential to enable EM communication in nanonetworks.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.1213001","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6704980/06708549.pdf","startPage":"685","endPage":"694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.1213001","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graphene-based Plasmonic Nano-Antenna for Terahertz Band Communication in Nanonetworks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","displayDocTitle":"Graphene-based Plasmonic Nano-Antenna for Terahertz Band Communication in Nanonetworks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708549/","publicationDate":"December 2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14030351","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6708549/","volume":"31","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graphene-based Plasmonic Nano-Antenna for Terahertz Band Communication in Nanonetworks","sourcePdf":"01-JSAC-SUPP-2-02.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096769S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6704980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"228","xplore-issue":"6704980","articleId":"6708549","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6708550,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Mesiti","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6704980/6708550/6708550-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fabio Mesiti received his M.Sc. degree in telecommunication engineering in 2005, and the Ph.D. in electronics and communications engineering in 2009 from Politecnico di Torino (Italy), where he worked as a Post-doc researcher from 2010 to 2011.

The stimulation of the cerebral cortex to assist the treatment of brain diseases have been investigated with growing interest in the past, where nanotechnology offers a dramatic breakthrough. In this paper, we discuss the feasibility of a nanomachine-to-neuron interface to design a nanoscale stimulator device called synaptic nanomachine (SnM), compatible with the neuronal communication paradigm. An equivalent neuron-nanomachine model (EqNN) is proposed to describe the behavior of neurons excited by a network of SnMs. Sample populations of neurons are simulated under different stimulation scenarios. The assessment of the existing correlation between SnM stimulus and response, as well as between neurons and clusters of neurons, has been performed using statistical methods. The obtained results reveal that a controlled nanoscale stimulation induces apparently an oscillatory behavior in the neuronal activity and localized synchronization between neurons. Both effects are expected to have the basis of important cognitive and behavioral functions such as learning and brain plasticity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nanomachine-to-Neuron Communication Interfaces for Neuronal Stimulation at Nanoscale","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.1213002","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6704980/06708550.pdf","startPage":"695","endPage":"704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.1213002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704980","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708550/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","displayDocTitle":"Nanomachine-to-Neuron Communication Interfaces for Neuronal Stimulation at Nanoscale","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6708550/","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2014","publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"14030344","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nanomachine-to-Neuron Communication Interfaces for Neuronal Stimulation at Nanoscale","sourcePdf":"02-JSAC-SUPP-2-01.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13659S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6704980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6704980","articleId":"6708550","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6708551,"authors":[{"name":"Deniz Kilinc","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ko\u00e7 University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6704980/6708551/6708551-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Deniz Kilinc (S'12) received his B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2011.

Transmission of the information is achieved by means of diffusion of molecules and the information is recovered based on the molecule concentration variations at the receiver location. The MC is very prone to intersymbol interference (ISI) due to residual molecules emitted previously. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of the molecule movements adds noise to the MC. For the first time, we propose four methods for a receiver in the MC to recover the transmitted information distorted by both ISI and noise. We introduce sequence detection methods based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood (ML) criterions, a linear equalizer based on minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion, and a decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) which is a nonlinear equalizer. We present a channel estimator to estimate time varying MC channel at the receiver. The performances of the proposed methods based on bit error rates are evaluated. The sequence detection methods reveal the best performance at the expense of computational complexity. However, the MMSE equalizer has the lowest performance with the lowest computational complexity. The results show that using these methods significantly increases the information transmission rate in the MC.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.1213003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.1213003","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6704980/06708551.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receiver Design for Molecular Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2013","displayDocTitle":"Receiver Design for Molecular Communication","volume":"31","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6708551/","publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"14030345","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708551/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receiver Design for Molecular Communication","sourcePdf":"03-JSAC-SUPP-2-05.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092301S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6704980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"184","xplore-issue":"6704980","articleId":"6708551","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6708552,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Kuscu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6704980/6708552/6708552-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Murat Kuscu (S'11) received his B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in July 2011.

In this study, we propose a novel nanoscale communication method based on multi-step FRET using identical fluorophores as relay nodes between communicating nanomachines, and utilizing multi-exciton transmission scheme in order to improve the limited range of the communication and achievable transmission rate over the nanoscale channel. We investigate two communication scenarios: immobile nanomachines communicating through a channel in a host material with linearly located relay nodes, and mobile nanomachines communicating through a channel in a 3-dimensional aqueous environment with randomly deployed relay nodes. We simulate the communication over these channels with realistic algorithms considering the high degree of randomness intrinsic to FRET phenomenon. Using the simulation results and following a Monte Carlo approach, we evaluate the performance of the channels by means of information theoretical capacity and interference probability. We show that multi-step FRET-based communication significantly outperforms the other biologically inspired nanocommunication techniques proposed so far in terms of maximum achievable data transmission rates. The results underline the compatibility and practicality of the FRET-based communication for several applications ranging from molecular computers to nanosensor networks.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.1213004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6704980/06708552.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.1213004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704980","startPage":"715","endPage":"725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Step FRET-Based Long-Range Nanoscale Communication Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708552","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Step FRET-Based Long-Range Nanoscale Communication Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708552/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2013","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"12","publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"14030354","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6708552/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Step FRET-Based Long-Range Nanoscale Communication Channel","sourcePdf":"04-JSAC-SUPP-2-03.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059991S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6704980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6704980","articleId":"6708552","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6708553,"authors":[{"name":"Ignacio Llatser","affiliation":["Nanonetworking Center in Catalunya (N3Cat), Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6704980/6708553/6708553-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ignacio Llatser graduated with a double degree in telecommunication engineering and computer science from the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) in 2008, where he also received a M.Sc. in computer architecture, networks, and systems in 2011.

However, it is still not clear how these nanosystems will communicate among them. This work considers a scenario of Diffusion-based Molecular Communication (DMC), a promising paradigm that has been recently proposed to implement nanonetworks. In a DMC network, transmitters encode information by the emission of molecules which diffuse throughout the medium, eventually reaching the receiver locations. In this scenario, a pulse-based modulation scheme is proposed and two techniques for the detection of the molecular pulses, namely, amplitude detection and energy detection, are compared. In order to evaluate the performance of DMC using both detection schemes, the most important communication metrics in each case are identified. Their analytical expressions are obtained and validated by simulation. Finally, the scalability of the obtained performance evaluation metrics in both detection techniques is compared in order to determine their suitability to particular DMC scenarios. Energy detection is found to be more suitable when the transmission distance constitutes a bottleneck in the performance of the network, whereas amplitude detection will allow achieving a higher transmission rate in the cases where the transmission distance is not a limitation. These results provide interesting insights which may serve designers as a guide to implement future DMC networks.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.1213005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.1213005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6704980/06708553.pdf","startPage":"726","endPage":"734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection Techniques for Diffusion-based Molecular Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2013","displayDocTitle":"Detection Techniques for Diffusion-based Molecular Communication","volume":"31","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6708553/","publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"14030353","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708553/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection Techniques for Diffusion-based Molecular Communication","sourcePdf":"05-JSAC-SUPP-2-04.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10998S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6704980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"114","xplore-issue":"6704980","articleId":"6708553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6708558,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-Hung Ho","affiliation":["Corning Incorporated"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6704980/6708558/6708558-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chun-Hung Ho (S'11) was born in Taipei City, Taiwan, in 1987.

In this paper, we propose a flexible multi-block OFDM (MB-OFDM) transmission scheme to simultaneously solve those problems. First, one guard interval is shared by multiple blocks by exploiting the slow time-varying property of the fiber-wireless channel, so the spectral efficiency could be typically improved by about 10%. Second, the proposed scheme further divides every data block into multiple small sub-blocks, whereby each sub-block is generated by an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) of smaller size accordingly. It thus provides a flexible compromise between the multi-carrier and single-carrier transmissions, and reduces the PAPR and the sensitivity to CFO. In addition, a hybrid-domain channel equalization method is proposed to detect the MB-OFDM signal by utilizing the single-carrier and multi-carrier transmission formats successively. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed scheme.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6704980/06708559.pdf","startPage":"788","endPage":"796","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.12130011","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.12130011","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704980","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6708559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible Multi-Block OFDM Transmission for High-Speed Fiber-Wireless Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Peak to average power ratio","Time-domain analysis","Frequency-domain analysis","Optical fiber networks","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","fast Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","time-varying channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible multiblock OFDM transmission","high-speed fiber-wireless networks","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","FiWi networks","carrier frequency offset","MB-OFDM transmission","time-varying property","fiber-wireless channel","inverse fast Fourier transform","IFFT","multicarrier transmissions","single-carrier transmissions","hybrid-domain channel equalization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber-wireless (FiWi) networks","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","spectral efficiency","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","carrier frequency offset (CFO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2013","displayDocTitle":"Flexible Multi-Block OFDM Transmission for High-Speed Fiber-Wireless Networks","volume":"31","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6708559/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"14030347","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Multi-Block OFDM Transmission for High-Speed Fiber-Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"11-JSAC-SUPP2-dai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074981S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6704980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6704980","articleId":"6708559","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6708564,"authors":[{"name":"Tadashi Nakano","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6704980/6708564/6708564-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tadashi Nakano received his Ph.D. degree in information systems engineering from Osaka University in 2002.

In molecular communication, a group of bio-nanomachines acting as senders transmit molecules, the molecules propagate in the environment, and another group of bio-nanomachines acting as receivers chemically react to the molecules propagating in the environment. In the model of molecular communication considered in this paper, senders may transmit molecules at a high rate to accelerate the receiver reactions or to increase the throughput. However, if the senders transmit molecules faster than the receivers react, the excess molecules remain in the environment and eventually degrade or diffuse away, which results in loss of molecules or degradation in efficiency. Such a potential issue associated with throughput and efficiency is in this paper discussed as an optimization problem. A mathematical expression for an upper-bound on the throughput and efficiency is first derived to provide an insight into the impact of model parameters. The optimal transmission rates that maximize the throughput and efficiency are then numerically calculated and presented, and throughput and efficiency are shown to be in trade-off relationships in a wide range of transmission rates. Further, two classes of feedback-based transmission rate control schemes are designed for autonomous bio-nanomachines to dynamically control their transmission rates, respectively based on negative and positive feedback from the receivers. The numerical evaluation of the two transmission rate control schemes is then shown to provide useful guidelines for application developers to satisfy their design goals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708564/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2013","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","volume":"31","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14030360","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2014","publicationDate":"December 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6708564/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transmission Rate Control for Molecular Communication among Biological Nanomachines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission Rate Control for Molecular Communication among Biological Nanomachines","sourcePdf":"16-jsacsupp2-nakano.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114126S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6704980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"6704980","articleId":"6708564","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6708565,"authors":[{"name":"Na-Rae Kim","affiliation":["School of Integrated Technology, Yonsei University, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6704980/6708565/6708565-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Na-Rae Kim (S'12) received her B.S. degree in chemical engineering from Yonsei University, Korea, in 2011.

In diffusion-based molecular communications, molecules as information symbols diffusing in the fluid environments suffer from molecule crossovers, i.e., the arriving order of molecules is different from their transmission order, leading to intersymbol interference (ISI). In this paper, we introduce a new family of channel codes, called ISI-free codes, which improve the communication reliability while keeping the decoding complexity fairly low in the diffusion environment modeled by the Brownian motion. We propose general encoding/decoding schemes for the ISI-free codes, working upon the modulation schemes of transmitting a fixed number of identical molecules at a time. In addition, the bit error rate (BER) approximation function of the ISI-free codes is derived mathematically as an analytical tool to decide key factors in the BER performance. Compared with the uncoded systems, the proposed ISI-free codes offer good performance with reasonably low complexity for diffusion-based molecular communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.12130018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6704980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP2.12130018","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/6704980/06708566.pdf","startPage":"857","endPage":"867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Codes for Reliability Enhancement in Molecular Communication","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"December  2013","displayDocTitle":"Channel Codes for Reliability Enhancement in Molecular Communication","volume":"31","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2013","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6708566/","publicationDate":"December 2013","accessionNumber":"14030355","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6708566/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Codes for Reliability Enhancement in Molecular Communication","sourcePdf":"18-jsacsupp2-shih.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084445S","chronDate":"December  2013","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"6704980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6704980","articleId":"6708566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6708567,"authors":[{"name":"Guopeng Wei","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/6704980/6708567/6708567-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guopeng Wei received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from the University of Electronics Science and Technology of China.

Moreover, we show how this platform can be used to model synthetic bacterial consortia which implement a XOR function and aggregate nearby bacteria using light communication.

However, traditional Von Neumann architecture and the limited signal connections have severely constrained the scalability and performance of such hardware implementations. Recently, many research efforts have been investigated in utilizing the latest discovered memristors in neuromorphic systems due to the similarity of memristors to biological synapses. In this paper, we explore the potential of a memristor crossbar array that functions as an autoassociative memory and apply it to brain-state-in-a-box (BSB) neural networks. Especially, the recall and training functions of a multianswer character recognition process based on the BSB model are studied. The robustness of the BSB circuit is analyzed and evaluated based on extensive Monte Carlo simulations, considering input defects, process variations, and electrical fluctuations. The results show that the hardware-based training scheme proposed in the paper can alleviate and even cancel out the majority of the noise issue.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2296777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2296777","startPage":"1864","endPage":"1878","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6914636/06709674.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6914636","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memristor Crossbar-Based Neuromorphic Computing System: A Case Study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Memristor Crossbar-Based Neuromorphic Computing System: A Case Study","volume":"25","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14633763","pubMedId":"25291739","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6709674/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"DARPA","grantNumber":"D13AP00042"},{"fundingName":"NSF EECS-1311747"},{"fundingName":"CNS","grantNumber":"1253424 and 1116684"},{"fundingName":"AFRL","grantNumber":"88ABW-2013-3869"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memristor Crossbar-Based Neuromorphic Computing System: A Case Study","sourcePdf":"tnnls-hu-2296777-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120145S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6914636","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"216","xplore-issue":"6914636","articleId":"6709674","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":6709676,"authors":[{"name":"Liangjun Ke","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xian Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/6898047/6709676/ke-2295886-small.gif","p":["Liangjun Ke received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in mathematics from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in systems engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China, in 2008.","He is currently an Associate Professor with Xi'an Jiaotong University, China.

It decomposes a combinatorial multiobjective problem into a number of single objective optimization problems using an aggregation method. MOMAD evolves three populations: 1) population P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</sub>\n for recording the current solution to each subproblem; 2) population P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</sub>\n for storing starting solutions for Pareto local search; and 3) an external population P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E</sub>\n for maintaining all the nondominated solutions found so far during the search. A problem-specific single objective heuristic can be applied to these subproblems to initialize the three populations. At each generation, a Pareto local search method is first applied to search a neighborhood of each solution in P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</sub>\n to update P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</sub>\n and P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E</sub>\n. Then a single objective local search is applied to each perturbed solution in P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</sub>\n for improving P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">L</sub>\n and P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E</sub>\n, and reinitializing P\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</sub>\n. The procedure is repeated until a stopping condition is met. MOMAD provides a generic hybrid multiobjective algorithmic framework in which problem specific knowledge, well developed single objective local search and heuristics and Pareto local search methods can be hybridized. It is a population based iterative method and thus an anytime algorithm. Extensive experiments have been conducted in this paper to study MOMAD and compare it with some other state-of-the-art algorithms on the multiobjective traveling salesman problem and the multiobjective knapsack problem. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms or performs similarly to the best so far heuristics on these two problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and

In particular, we consider three scenarios, including a static single-hop secondary network, a static multihop secondary network, and a mobile secondary network. For these cases, with the consideration of general mobility and interference models, we design efficient scheduling and channel allocation algorithms based on the concept of Lyapunov drift and give the corresponding performance bound. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithms can achieve a flexible tradeoff between network throughput and average backlogs by using the Lyapunov optimization technique. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed algorithms is verified by the numerical simulations.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2299550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6895341","startPage":"3351","endPage":"3368","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6895341/06709745.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Scheduling and Channel Allocation in MC-MR Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6709745/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Scheduling and Channel Allocation in MC-MR Cognitive Radio Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14581670","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"7","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61325012, 61271219, 61221001, 61 202373 and 61102052"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars (State Education Ministry)"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Basic Research Key Project","grantNumber":"13510711300, 12JC1405200 and 11JC1405100"},{"fundingName":"Chinese Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NCET-10-0580"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2012T50417"},{"fundingName":"National Key Project of China","grantNumber":"2012ZX03001009"},{"fundingName":"Doctoral Fund of the Chinese Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"13005160"},{"fundingName":"Southeastern University SKL Project","grantNumber":"2012D13"},{"fundingName":"Open Foundation of the State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications","grantNumber":"SKLNST-2013-1-16"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Data Storage and Transmission Technology, Hangzhou Dianzi University","grantNumber":"201306"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Scheduling and Channel Allocation in MC-MR Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2299550-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165483S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6895341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6895341","articleId":"6709745","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6709746,"authors":[{"name":"Sanguhn Cha","affiliation":["Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/6755472/6709746/6709746-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sanguhn Cha was born in Busan, Korea, in 1982.

Simultaneous testing of data bit and check bit arrays eliminates the test time and hardware overheads required for separate check bit array tests. In order to test data bit and check bit arrays simultaneously, the proposed SEC-DAEC code generates the identical data background patterns for data bit and check bit arrays. The testable faults using the proposed SEC-DAEC code are the most general memory fault models such as single-cell faults and interword and intraword coupling faults. Simultaneous testing of data bit and check bit arrays using the proposed SEC-DAEC codes brings significant decreases of about 27.3%, 17.9%, and 11.1% in the time required for memory array tests for 16, 32, and 64 data bits per word, respectively.

subcategory-aware object detection framework to detect generic object classes with high intra-class variance. Motivated by the observation that the object appearance demonstrates some clustering property, we split the training data into subcategories and train a detector for each subcategory. Since the proposed ensemble of detectors relies heavily on subcategory clustering, we propose an effective subcategories generation method that is tuned for the detection task. More specifically, we first initialize subcategories by constrained spectral clustering based on mid-level image features used in object recognition. Then we jointly learn the ensemble detectors and the latent subcategories in an alternative manner. Our performance on the PASCAL VOC 2007 detection challenges and INRIA Person dataset is comparable with state-of-the-art, even with much less computational cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6709751/","accessionNumber":"14979290","displayDocTitle":"Subcategory-Aware Object Detection","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"DBI 10-6235"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcategory-Aware Object Detection","sourcePdf":"lsp-wang-2299571-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061239S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7017605","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7017605","articleId":"6709751","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6709752,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron D.

The orbit is furthermore assumed to be exponentially stable within the hybrid zero dynamics. Prior results on the stabilization of such periodic orbits with respect to the full-order dynamics of the system with impulse effects have relied on input-output linearization of the dynamics transverse to the zero dynamics manifold. The principal result of this paper demonstrates that a variant of control Lyapunov functions that enforce rapid exponential convergence to the zero dynamics surface, Z, can be used to achieve exponential stability of the periodic orbit in the full-order dynamics, thereby significantly extending the class of stabilizing controllers. The main result is illustrated on a hybrid model of a bipedal walking robot through simulations and is utilized to experimentally achieve bipedal locomotion via control Lyapunov functions.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2014.2299335","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/6776438/06709752.pdf","startPage":"876","endPage":"891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2014.2299335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6776438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapidly Exponentially Stabilizing Control Lyapunov Functions and Hybrid Zero Dynamics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6709752","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709752/","displayDocTitle":"Rapidly Exponentially Stabilizing Control Lyapunov Functions and Hybrid Zero Dynamics","volume":"59","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14182311","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6709752/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapidly Exponentially Stabilizing Control Lyapunov Functions and Hybrid Zero Dynamics","sourcePdf":"tac-ames-2299335-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126291S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6776438","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"6776438","articleId":"6709752","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6709760,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Kheirkhahi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/6730973/6709760/6709760-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alireza Kheirkhahi (S'96\u2013M'00) received the Bachelor's and Master's degrees in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology and University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, in 1996 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California at San Diego (UCSD), La Jolla, CA, USA, in 2013.","From 1999 to 2003, he was a Senior Design Engineer with Valence Semiconductor, Irvine, CA, USA, where he designed CMOS RF and mixed-signal integrated circuits (ICs) for GPS and wireless local area network (WLAN) systems.

A new method for designing the transmit beamspace matrix that enables the use of search-free DOA estimation techniques at the receiver is introduced. The essence of the proposed method is to design the transmit beamspace matrix based on minimizing the difference between a desired transmit beampattern and the actual one while enforcing the constraint of uniform power distribution across the transmit array elements. The desired transmit beampattern can be of arbitrary shape and is allowed to consist of one or more spatial sectors. The number of transmit waveforms is even but otherwise arbitrary. To allow for simple search-free DOA estimation algorithms at the receive array, the rotational invariance property is established at the transmit array by imposing a specific structure on the beamspace matrix. Semidefinite programming relaxation is used to approximate the proposed formulation by a convex problem that can be solved efficiently. We also propose a spatial-division based design (SDD) by dividing the spatial domain into several subsectors and assigning a subset of the transmit beams to each subsector. The transmit beams associated with each subsector are designed separately. Simulation results demonstrate the improvement in the DOA estimation performance offered by using the proposed joint and SDD transmit beamspace design methods as compared to the traditional MIMO radar technique.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2299513","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6744712/06709762.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2299513","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6744712","startPage":"1490","endPage":"1500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Transmit Beamspace Design for Search-Free Based DOA Estimation in MIMO Radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6709762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Transmit Beamspace Design for Search-Free Based DOA Estimation in MIMO Radar","chronOrPublicationDate":"March15,  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709762/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"6","publicationDate":"March15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14126920","dateOfInsertion":"26 February 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6709762/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Transmit Beamspace Design for Search-Free Based DOA Estimation in MIMO Radar","sourcePdf":"tsp-vorobyov-2299513-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10181S","chronDate":"March15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6744712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"6744712","articleId":"6709762","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6709764,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Power","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin\u2014Madison, Madison, WI"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Power","id":"37085591841"},{"name":"Joel Hestness","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sciences, University of Wisconsin\u2014Madison, Madison, WI"],"firstName":"Joel","lastName":"Hestness","id":"38480735700"},{"name":"Marc S.

Bonded to a structure, the sheet thus enables strain sensing scalable to high spatial resolutions. In order to combine the two technologies in a correspondingly scalable manner, non-contact interfaces are used. Inductive and capacitive antennas are patterned on the LAE sheet and on the IC packages, so that system assembly is achieved via low-cost sheet lamination without metallurgical bonds. The LAE sheet integrates thin-film strain gauges, thin-film transistors, and long interconnects on a 50-\u03bcm-thick polyimide sheet, and the CMOS ICs integrate subsystems for sensor readout, control, and communication over the distributed sheet in a 130 nm process.

The amplified output is `folded' into a predefined range of voltages by using comparison and reset circuits along with the core amplifier. After this output signal is digitized and transmitted, a reconstruction algorithm can be applied in the digital domain to recover the amplified signal from the folded waveform. This scheme enables the use of an analog-to-digital convertor with less number of bits for the same effective dynamic range. It also reduces the transmission data rate of the recording chip. Both of these features allow power and area savings at the system level. Other advantages of the proposed topology are increased reliability due to the removal of pseudo-resistors, lower harmonic distortion and low-voltage operation. An analysis of the reconstruction error introduced by this scheme is presented along with a behavioral model to provide a quick estimate of the post reconstruction dynamic range. Measurement results from two different core amplifier designs in 65 nm and 180 nm CMOS processes are presented to prove the generality of the proposed scheme in the neural recording applications. Operating from a 1 V power supply, the amplifier in 180 nm CMOS has a gain of 54.2 dB, bandwidth of 5.7 kHz, input referred noise of 3.8 \u03bcV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rms</sub>\n and power dissipation of 2.52 \u03bcW leading to a NEF of 3.1 in spike band.

This paper introduces a new context-dependent classification algorithm to address and exploit this phenomenon. Within the proposed framework, an ensemble of classifiers is constructed, each associated with a particular environment. The key to the method is that the relative importance of each object (i.e., data point) during the learning phase for a given classifier is controlled via a modulating factor based on the similarity of auxiliary environment features. Importantly, the number of classifiers to learn and all other associated model parameters are inferred automatically from the training data. The promise of the proposed method is demonstrated on classification tasks seeking to distinguish underwater targets from clutter in synthetic aperture sonar imagery. The measured data were collected with an autonomous underwater vehicle during several large experiments, conducted at sea between 2008 and 2012, in different geographical locations with diverse environmental conditions. For these data, the environment was quantified by features (extracted from the imagery directly) measuring the anisotropy and the complexity of the seabed. Experimental results suggest that the classification performance of the proposed approach compares favorably to conventional classification algorithms as well as state-of-the-art context-dependent methods. Results also reveal the object features that are salient for performing target classification in different underwater environments.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2013.2295843","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/6819879/06709770.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6819879","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2013.2295843","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"6284","endPage":"6297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Environmental Information for Improved Underwater Target Classification in Sonar Imagery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6709770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Environmental Information for Improved Underwater Target Classification in Sonar Imagery","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709770/","volume":"52","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6709770/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14331715","dateOfInsertion":"22 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Environmental Information for Improved Underwater Target Classification in Sonar Imagery","sourcePdf":"tgrs-williams-2295843-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079307S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6819879","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6819879","articleId":"6709770","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6709775,"authors":[{"name":"Wu He","affiliation":["Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6809862/6709775/6709775-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wu He received the B.S. degree in computer science from DongHua University, Shanghai, China, in 1998, and the Ph.D. degree in information science from the University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA, in 2006.","His research interests include enterprise applications, data mining, cyber security, and knowledge management."]},"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"He","id":"37085350269"},{"name":"Gongjun Yan","affiliation":["University of Southern Indiana, Evansville, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6809862/6709775/6709775-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Gongjun Yan received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA, in 2010.","Currently, he is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science with the University of Southern Indiana, Evansville, IN, USA.

The introduced technique fully eliminates the effect of sneak paths by reading the stored data using multiple access points and evaluating a simple addition/subtraction on the different readings. The new method requires fewer reading steps compared to previously reported techniques, and has a very small impact on the memory density. To verify the underlying theory, the proposed system is simulated using Synopsys HSPICE showing the ability to achieve a 100% sneak-path error-free memory. In addition, the effect of quantization bits on the system performance is studied.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709781/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","volume":"13","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14156268","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6709781/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Memristor Multiport Readout: A Closed-Form Solution for Sneak Paths","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memristor Multiport Readout: A Closed-Form Solution for Sneak Paths","sourcePdf":"tnano-zidan-2299558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159913S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6758434","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"6758434","articleId":"6709781","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6709782,"authors":[{"name":"Tarik Taleb","affiliation":["NEC Europe, Ltd., Heidelberg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6895341/6709782/taleb-2299633-small.gif","p":["\nTarik Taleb (SM'10) received the B.E. degree in information engineering\n(with distinction) and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in information science from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in\n2001, 2003, and 2005, respectively.","From October 2005 to March 2006, he was a Research Fellow with the Intelligent Cosmos Research Institute, Sendai.\nThen, until March 2009, he was an Assistant Professor with the Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku\nUniversity, in a laboratory fully funded by KDDI: the second largest network operator in Japan.

Mobile network decentralization will not be efficient without rethinking mobility management schemes, particularly for users moving for a long distance and/or at a high speed (e.g., vehicles and bullet trains). To support such highly mobile users, this paper introduces: 1) a data anchor gateway (GW) relocation method based on user mobility, history information, and user activity patterns, and 2) a handover management policy that selects a target base station or evolved Node B (eNB) in a way to minimize mobility anchor GW relocation. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated via Markov model-based analysis and through simulations. Encouraging results are obtained, validating the design objectives of the scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2299633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/6895341/06709782.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2299633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6895341","startPage":"3381","endPage":"3396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supporting Highly Mobile Users in Cost-Effective Decentralized Mobile Operator Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6709782","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Supporting Highly Mobile Users in Cost-Effective Decentralized Mobile Operator Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709782/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14581700","dateOfInsertion":"11 September 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6709782/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supporting Highly Mobile Users in Cost-Effective Decentralized Mobile Operator Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-ksentini-2299633-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095749S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6895341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"6895341","articleId":"6709782","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6709785,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhang","affiliation":["Nankai University, Chern Institute of Mathematics, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"p":["Jun Zhang was born in Jiangsu, China, on March 30, 1986.

Then, the stopping sets, the stopping set distribution, and the stopping distance of the AG code from an elliptic curve are reduced to the search, counting, and decision versions of the subset sum problem in the group of rational points of the elliptic curve, respectively. Finally, for some special cases, we determine the stopping set distributions of the AG codes from elliptic curves.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2299545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2299545","startPage":"1488","endPage":"1495","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6739111/06709785.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6739111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stopping Sets of Algebraic Geometry Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Stopping Sets of Algebraic Geometry Codes","volume":"60","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 February 2014","accessionNumber":"14096817","publicationDate":"March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6709785/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stopping Sets of Algebraic Geometry Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-fu-2299545-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084649S","chronDate":"March  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6739111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6739111","articleId":"6709785","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6709794,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron D.

Beginning with human walking data, outputs-or functions of the kinematics-are determined that result in a low-dimensional representation of human locomotion. These same outputs can be considered on a robot, and human-inspired control is used to drive the outputs of the robot to the outputs of the human. The main results of this paper are that, in the case of both under and full actuation, the parameters of this controller can be determined through a human-inspired optimization problem that provides the best fit of the human data while simultaneously provably guaranteeing stable robotic walking for which the initial condition can be computed in closed form. These formal results are demonstrated in simulation by considering two bipedal robots-an underactuated 2-D bipedal robot, AMBER, and fully actuated 3-D bipedal robot, NAO-for which stable robotic walking is automatically obtained using only human data.

The problems are the k-shortest time path problems with any combination of three constraints: time, hop, and label constraints, and the graphs can be directed, undirected, or bidirected with symmetric and/or asymmetric traversal time, which can be real and time dependent. Isomorphic to the graph where the SP is to be sought, the network is activated by generating autowave at source neuron and the autowave travels automatically along the paths with the speed of a hop in an iteration. Properties of the network are studied, algorithms are presented, and computation complexity is analyzed. The framework guarantees globally optimal solutions of a series of problems during the iteration process of the network, which provides insight into why even the SP is still too long to be satisfied. The network facilitates very large scale integrated circuit implementation and adapt to very large scale problems due to its massively parallel processing and minimum resource utilization. When implemented in a sequentially processing computer, experiments on synthetic graphs, road maps of cities of the USA, and vehicle routing with time windows indicate that the MRNN is especially efficient for large scale sparse graphs and even dense graphs with some constraints, e.g., the CPU time taken and the iteration number used for the road maps of cities of the USA is even less than ~2% and 0.5% that of the Dijkstra's algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2293775","startPage":"1566","endPage":"1582","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2293775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6855384","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/6855384/06709796.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Minimum Resource Neural Network Framework for Solving Multiconstraint Shortest Path Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709796/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Minimum Resource Neural Network Framework for Solving Multiconstraint Shortest Path Problems","volume":"25","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6709796/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14466249","pubMedId":"25050952","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Chinese National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"61070137, 91130006 and 61201312"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Minimum Resource Neural Network Framework for Solving Multiconstraint Shortest Path Problems","sourcePdf":"tnnls-zhang-2293775-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146824S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"6855384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6855384","articleId":"6709796","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6709802,"authors":[{"name":"Luciano Mescia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Information Engineering, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Luciano Mescia received the Master's degree in electronic engineering in 2000 and the Ph.D. degree in electromagnetic fields in 2003.

The proposed simulator consists of a simulation kernel, a software compiler, a system profiler providing performance, area and power information for the desired architectures, and a system debugger supporting inspecting and modification of the internal state of the RPU. Object-oriented hierarchical and parameterized architecture modeling techniques are proposed to satisfy the requirements for a fast and comprehensive evaluation. Cycle-accurate simulation mechanisms are developed to improve the accuracy of the profiled performance data. Compared with the traditional register transfer level (RTL) based simulation scheme, the proposed simulator could achieve an average speedup of 18.5\u00d7 with only 3.5% reduction on performance estimation accuracy. One reconfigurable processor targeted at high-definition multimedia decoding applications (such as H.264, MPEG2, AVS, etc.) is implemented with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company 65-nm process using the proposed exploration and design flow. The measured results show that the implemented architecture has obvious advantages in terms of both performance and power consumption than the reference designs in multimedia decoding applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709803/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6709803/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","accessionNumber":"14762500","volume":"22","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"SimRPU: A Simulation Environment for Reconfigurable Architecture Exploration","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China National High Technologies Research Program","grantNumber":"2012AA012701"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61274131 and 61106022"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SimRPU: A Simulation Environment for Reconfigurable Architecture Exploration","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-liu-2295622-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110296S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6963544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6963544","articleId":"6709803","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6709807,"authors":[{"name":"Cem Tekin","affiliation":["UCLA, Department of Electrical Engineering, Los Angeles, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4200690/6856242/6709807/6709807-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Cem Tekin is a Postdoctoral Scholar at University of California, Los Angeles.

In contrast to centralized recommender systems, in which there is a single centralized seller who has access to the complete inventory of items as well as the complete record of sales and user information, in decentralized recommender systems each seller/learner only has access to the inventory of items and user information for its own products and not the products and user information of other sellers, but can get commission if it sells an item of another seller. Therefore, the sellers must distributedly find out for an incoming user which items to recommend (from the set of own items or items of another seller), in order to maximize the revenue from own sales and commissions. We formulate this problem as a cooperative contextual bandit problem, analytically bound the performance of the sellers compared to the best recommendation strategy given the complete realization of user arrivals and the inventory of items, as well as the context-dependent purchase probabilities of each item, and verify our results via numerical examples on a distributed data set adapted based on Amazon data. We evaluate the dependence of the performance of a seller on the inventory of items the seller has, the number of connections it has with the other sellers, and the commissions which the seller gets by selling items of other sellers to its users.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Online Learning in Social Recommender Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2299517","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4200690/6856242/06709807.pdf","startPage":"638","endPage":"652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2299517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6856242","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6709807","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709807/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Online Learning in Social Recommender Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6709807/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14450744","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Online Learning in Social Recommender Systems","sourcePdf":"jstsp-tekin-2299517-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096236S","chronDate":"Aug.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6856242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6856242","articleId":"6709807","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6709808,"authors":[{"name":"Luke T.

Prior work on virtual network embedding has primarily focused on maximizing the revenue of the Internet service provider and did not consider the energy cost in accommodating such requests. As energy cost is more than half of the operating cost of the substrate networks, while trying to accommodate more virtual network requests, minimizing energy cost is critical for infrastructure providers. In this paper, we make the first effort toward energy-aware virtual network embedding. We first propose an energy cost model and formulate the energy-aware virtual network embedding problem as an integer linear programming problem. We then propose two efficient energy-aware virtual network embedding algorithms: a heuristic-based algorithm and a particle-swarm-optimization-technique-based algorithm. We implemented our algorithms in C++ and performed side-by-side comparison with prior algorithms. The simulation results show that our algorithms significantly reduce the energy cost by up to 50% over the existing algorithm for accommodating the same sequence of virtual network requests.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/6922183/06709811.pdf","startPage":"1607","endPage":"1620","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2013.2286156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2013.2286156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6922183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6709811","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Virtual Network Embedding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Substrates","Electricity","Bandwidth","Tin","Power demand","Algorithm design and analysis","Heuristic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["C++ language","computer networks","integer programming","Internet","linear programming","particle swarm optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-aware virtual network embedding problem","shared substrate network","Internet service provider","virtual network requests","energy cost","infrastructure providers","integer linear programming problem","heuristic-based algorithm","particle swarm optimization","C++ algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Network virtualization","virtual network embedding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Virtual Network Embedding","volume":"22","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6709811/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665396","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61170274, 61370226, 61375066, 61105127 and 61321491"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware Virtual Network Embedding","sourcePdf":"tnet-liu-2286156-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107008S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"6922183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"6922183","articleId":"6709811","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6709819,"authors":[{"name":"Shenghua Gao","affiliation":["Advanced Digital Sciences Center, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/6766693/6709819/6709819-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shenghua Gao received the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore in 2013, and received the B.E. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2008.

By leveraging the dependency between image class label and tags, we introduce a multi-layer group sparse structure of the reconstruction coefficients. Such structure fully encodes the mutual dependency between the class label, which describes image content as a whole, and tags, which describe the components of the image content. Therefore we propose a multi-layer group based tag propagation method, which combines the class label and subgroups of instances with similar tag distribution to annotate test images. To make our model more suitable for nonlinear separable features, we also extend our multi-layer group sparse coding in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which further improves performances of image classification and annotation. Moreover, we also integrate our multi-layer group sparse coding with kNN strategy, which greatly improves the computational efficiency. Experimental results on the LabelMe, UIUC-Sports and NUS-WIDE-Object databases show that our method outperforms the baseline methods, and achieves excellent performances in both image classification and annotation tasks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709819/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14159299","htmlLink":"/document/6709819/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Concurrent Single-Label Image Classification and Annotation via Efficient Multi-Layer Group Sparse Coding","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Agency for Science Technology and Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concurrent Single-Label Image Classification and Annotation via Efficient Multi-Layer Group Sparse Coding","sourcePdf":"tmm-gao-2299516-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089769S","chronDate":"April  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"6766693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6766693","articleId":"6709819","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6709823,"authors":[{"name":"Juri Ranieri","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6732988/6709823/6709823-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Juri Ranieri (S'11) received both his M.S. and B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering in 2009 and 2007, respectively, from Universit\u00e1 di Bologna, Italy.

The number of sensors is often limited by physical or economical constraints and their placement is of fundamental importance to obtain accurate estimates. Unfortunately, the selection of the optimal sensor locations is intrinsically combinatorial and the available approximation algorithms are not guaranteed to generate good solutions in all cases of interest. We propose FrameSense, a greedy algorithm for the selection of optimal sensor locations. The core cost function of the algorithm is the frame potential, a scalar property of matrices that measures the orthogonality of its rows. Notably, FrameSense is the first algorithm that is near-optimal in terms of mean square error, meaning that its solution is always guaranteed to be close to the optimal one. Moreover, we show with an extensive set of numerical experiments that FrameSense achieves state-of-the-art performance while having the lowest computational cost, when compared to other greedy methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Optimal Sensor Placement for Linear Inverse Problems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2299518","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6732988/06709823.pdf","startPage":"1135","endPage":"1146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2299518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6732988","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6709823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"10 January 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1,  2014","displayDocTitle":"Near-Optimal Sensor Placement for Linear Inverse Problems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6709823/","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2014","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"March1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14078303","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Near-Optimal Sensor Placement for Linear Inverse Problems","sourcePdf":"tsp-ranieri-2299518-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078493S","chronDate":"March1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6732988","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"109","xplore-issue":"6732988","articleId":"6709823","onlineDate":"10 January 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":6709856,"authors":[{"name":"Christophe Veaux","affiliation":["Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR), University of Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Veaux","id":"37434761400"},{"name":"Junichi Yamagishi","affiliation":["Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR), University of Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Junichi","lastName":"Yamagishi","id":"37284459700"},{"name":"Simon King","affiliation":["Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR), University of Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"King","id":"37271607900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2378-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2379-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6709856","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":53,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1152},"abstract":"The University of Edinburgh has started the development of a new speech database, the Voice Bank corpus, specifically designed for the creation of personalised synthetic voices for individuals with speech disorders.

First, a high quality articulatory speech corpus including speech and 3D articulatory data of lips, tongue and jaw movements is collected through Electro-Magnetic Articulograph; second, the 3D articulatory modeling including shape design and motion synthesis is conducted. The articulatory shape is obtained by designing a precise 3D facial model including internal and external articulators. The articulatory motion synthesis is obtained combining parameterized model and anatomical model. The system can thus illustrate the slight differences among phonemes by synthesizing both internal and external articulatory movements. The perceptual evaluation shows the suitability of the system for instructing language learners to articulate.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6709843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSDA.2013.6709888","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference Oriental COCOSDA held jointly with 2013 Conference on Asian Spoken Language Research and Evaluation (O-COCOSDA/CASLRE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference Oriental COCOSDA held jointly with 2013 Conference on Asian Spoken Language Research and Evaluation (O-COCOSDA/CASLRE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6697947/6709843/06709888.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICSDA.2013.6709888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven 3D visual pronunciation of Chinese IPA for language learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven 3D visual pronunciation of Chinese IPA for language learning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Nov. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6709888/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14031337","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709888/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven 3D visual pronunciation of Chinese IPA for language learning","confLoc":"Gurgaon, India","sourcePdf":"OCOCOSDADataDriven3DVisualPronunciation.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112399S","chronDate":"25-27 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6697947","isNumber":"6709843","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6697947","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6709843","articleId":"6709888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":6709922,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjun Lv","affiliation":["The Faculty of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Lv","id":"37086716360"},{"name":"Xiaoli Xi","affiliation":["The Faculty of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoli","lastName":"Xi","id":"37605455600"},{"name":"Yongxing Du","affiliation":["The Faculty of Automation and Information Engineering, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yongxing","lastName":"Du","id":"37085510748"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2877-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2876-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6709922","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"abstract":"CDMA communication system has a certain anti-interference performance, but when the interference is stronger, the performance and stability of system will descend obviously.

Hardware experiments show that the algorithm can improve the performance of narrow-band interference suppression for the ordinary CDMA mobile phone about 25dB.","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Information Technology and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709838/6709913/06709922.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Information Technology and Applications","doi":"10.1109/ITA.2013.6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2013.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6709913","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6709922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Algorithm for Narrow-Band Interference Suppression in CDMA Communication System Based on Probability and Statistics Search","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference suppression","Probability","Frequency-domain analysis","Multiaccess communication","Hardware","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","electromagnetic interference","fast Fourier transforms","mobile handsets","probability","statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrow-band interference suppression","CDMA communication system","probability","statistics search","FFT transform","mobile phone"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["narrow-band interference suppression","CDMA","probability and statistics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Nov. 2013","displayDocTitle":"An Algorithm for Narrow-Band Interference Suppression in CDMA Communication System Based on Probability and Statistics Search","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6709922/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","accessionNumber":"14031408","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2014","conferenceDate":"16-17 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Algorithm for Narrow-Band Interference Suppression in CDMA Communication System Based on Probability and Statistics Search","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"2876a001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040571S","chronDate":"16-17 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709838","isNumber":"6709913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709838","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6709913","articleId":"6709922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6709993,"authors":[{"name":"Li Han","affiliation":["College of Physics and Electronic Information Engineering, Wenzhou University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Han","id":"37086789052"},{"name":"Ruan Xiu-Kai","affiliation":["College of Physics and Electronic Information Engineering, Wenzhou University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Ruan","lastName":"Xiu-Kai","id":"38274807300"},{"name":"Zhu Xiang-Ou","affiliation":["College of Physics and Electronic Information Engineering, Wenzhou University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Xiang-Ou","id":"37086787283"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2877-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2876-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6709993","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6709993","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Power harmonic filters","Artificial neural networks","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","neural nets","power engineering computing","power system harmonics","power system reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct weight determination neural network","harmonic detection algorithm","electric power system","ANN structure","real-time harmonic detection capability","sine base function","long weight training","phase information","amplitude information","simulation computation","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["harmonic detection","artificial neural network","weight computation","electric power system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITA.2013.77","pdfPath":"/iel7/6709838/6709913/06709993.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Information Technology and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 International Conference on Information Technology and Applications","startPage":"300","endPage":"303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6709913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITA.2013.77","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harmonic Detection Using the Direct Weight Determination Neural Network","abstract":"This paper presents a novel harmonic detection algorithm using the direct weight determination neural network for the electric power system. A new ANN structure is designed to strengthen the real-time capability of harmonic detection. The proposed algorithm employs the weight computation with sine base function to address the problem of harmonic detection. The optimal weight of this ANN with sine base function can be achieved by direct computation. This ANN can avoid the tediously long weight training and get the proper weight including the information of phase and amplitude of harmonic detection. The simulation computation demonstrates this algorithm has high precision and low computational complexity, and it has value in the harmonic detection of electric power system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-17 Nov. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6709993/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14031454","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6709993/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2014","conferenceDate":"16-17 Nov. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Harmonic Detection Using the Direct Weight Determination Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harmonic Detection Using the Direct Weight Determination Neural Network","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"2876a300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056122S","chronDate":"16-17 Nov. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6709838","isNumber":"6709913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6709838","xplore-issue":"6709913","articleId":"6709993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"}]
