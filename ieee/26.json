Computer and communications systems continue to proliferate in the office and home. Systems are varied and complex, involving wireless networks and mobile computers. However, systems are underused because the choices of control mechanisms and application interfaces are too diverse. It is therefore pertinent to consider which mechanisms might allow the user to manipulate systems in simple and ubiquitous ways, and how computers can be made more aware of the facilities in their surroundings. Knowledge of the location of people and equipment within an organization is such a mechanism. Annotating a resource database with location information allows location-based heuristics for control and interaction to be constructed. This approach is particularly attractive because location techniques can be devised that are physically unobtrusive and do not rely on explicit user action. The article describes the technology of a system for locating people and equipment, and the design of a distributed system service supporting access to that information. The application interfaces made possible by or that benefit from this facility are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed location system for the active office","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","doi":"10.1109/65.260080","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel3/65/6572/00260080.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"70","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/65.260080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260080/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1994","displayDocTitle":"A distributed location system for the active office","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4645709","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed location system for the active office","sourcePdf":"00260080.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030116S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1994","isNumber":"6572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"225","articleId":"260080","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":260196,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Simulated traffic from several video teleconferences is fed into a buffer and multiplexed onto a higher-speed output line. The cell loss resulting from buffer overflow is observed. The major results are as follows: (1) the spacing between cells has a large role in determining the aggregate cell loss rate seen by a collection of calls. The cell loss rate is reduced when either the frame start times are evenly spaced or cells are evenly distributed in the video frame. (2) After the cell loss rate becomes nonnegligible, it grows rapidly as a function of the number of access lines. (3) The cell losses are not distributed uniformly over time but are clustered. A consequence is that the average time between clusters of cell loss and the time to first loss is greater than if the losses were spaced uniformly. (4) A simple model is found to describe when a cluster of cell losses occurs, the duration of the cluster, and how many cells are lost in the cluster.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Teleconferencing","Intelligent networks","Asynchronous transfer mode","Traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Encoding","Gain","Bit rate","Buffer overflow","Aggregates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","image coding","multiplexing","packet switching","telecommunication networks","telecommunication traffic","teleconferencing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video teleconferencing","ATM networks","simulation study","potential multiplexing gains","variable-bit-rate encoding","multiplex video teleconferencing traffic","asynchronous transfer mode network","buffer","output line","cell loss","cell spacing","aggregate cell loss rate","frame start times","video frame","access lines","cell losses cluster"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.260197","startPage":"408","endPage":"420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/6578/00260197.pdf","doi":"10.1109/76.260197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance modeling of video teleconferencing in ATM networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Performance modeling of video teleconferencing in ATM networks","accessionNumber":"4646513","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","volume":"3","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance modeling of video teleconferencing in ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00260197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032142S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"31","articleId":"260197","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":260198,"authors":[{"name":"Yongyi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Yongyi Yang","id":"37280591700"},{"name":"N.P.

The problem is formulated as one of regularized image recovery. According to this formulation, the image in the decoder is reconstructed by using not only the transmitted data but also prior knowledge about the smoothness of the original image, which complements the transmitted data. Two methods are proposed for solving this regularized recovery problem. The first is based on the theory of projections onto convex sets (POCS) while the second is based on the constrained least squares (CLS) approach. For the POCS-based method, a new constraint set is defined that conveys smoothness information not captured by the transmitted BDCT coefficients, and the projection onto it is computed. For the CLS method an objective function is proposed that captures the smoothness properties of the original image. Iterative algorithms are introduced for its minimization.

It makes use of a natural processing concept called genetic algorithm (GA).

Experimental results demonstrate that GMS is more robust than other algorithms in locating the global optimum and is computationally simpler than the full search algorithm. GMS is also suitable for VLSI implementation because of its regularity and high architectural parallelism.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic motion search algorithm for video compression","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/76.260203","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/76/6578/00260203.pdf","startPage":"440","endPage":"445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/76.260203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6578","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260203","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260203/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Genetic motion search algorithm for video compression","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4646518","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic motion search algorithm for video compression","sourcePdf":"00260203.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030202S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"88","articleId":"260203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":260215,"authors":[{"name":"C.K.

It is found that a special kind of randomness, arising from the ability of the system to change its configuration in more than one predefined pattern, constitutes a unique feature of the chaotic dynamics of switched-mode converter circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/6579/00260215.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"23","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","doi":"10.1109/81.260215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.260215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6579","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flip bifurcation and chaos in three-state boost switching regulators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bifurcation","Chaos","Regulators","Switching circuits","Switches","Inductance","Feedback","Computer simulation","Switching converters","Power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bifurcation","chaos","voltage regulators","switching circuits","power supply circuits","nonlinear network analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flip bifurcation","chaos","three-state boost switching regulators","first-order iterative map","discontinuous mode","feedback factor","computer simulations","period-doubling route","chaotic dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","displayDocTitle":"Flip bifurcation and chaos in three-state boost switching regulators","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646646","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flip bifurcation and chaos in three-state boost switching regulators","sourcePdf":"00260215.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024787S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"209","articleId":"260215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":260216,"authors":[{"name":"Kaining Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"lastName":"Kaining Wang","id":"37086867347"},{"name":"N.

As with class A opamps, we identify nonlinear and linear regions of operation corresponding to slewing and settling periods in the transient response. But in contrast with class A opamps, it is shown that the feedback configuration should be considered for the entire duration of the transient response. It is shown that doublets (pole-zero pairs) have significant impact on the transient response of the class AB opamps in both nonlinear and linear regions of operation. One result is that in order to prevent overshoot in the transient response due to the doublets, the pole of the double should be located at a frequency higher than about four times the unity-gain bandwidth. The proposed analytical model is valid for any location of the doublets. It agrees well with the results of HSPICE computer simulations, and has the advantage over the latter of providing circuit designers with a clear relationship between the design goals and the device parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260220/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646651","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An analytical model for the transient response of CMOS class AB operational amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analytical model for the transient response of CMOS class AB operational amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00260220.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025545S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"6","articleId":"260220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":260224,"authors":[{"name":"I.W.

Unlike conventional look-ahead, relaxed look-ahead does not attempt to maintain the input-output (I/O) mapping between the serial and pipelined architectures but preserves the adaptation characteristics, resulting in a small hardware overhead. Relaxed look-ahead is employed to develop fine-grained pipelined architectures for least-mean-square (LMS) adaptive filtering. The proposed architecture achieves the desired speed-up, with little or no degradation in the convergence behavior. Simulation results verifying the convergence analysis results for the pipelined LMS filter are presented. The filter is then employed to develop a high-speed adaptive differential pulse-code-modulation (ADPCM) codec. The new architecture has a negligible hardware overhead which is independent of the number of quantizer levels, the predictor order and the pipelining level. Additionally, the pipelined codec has a much lower output latency than the level of pipelining. Simulations with image data indicate that speed-ups of up to 43 can be achieved with less than 1-dB loss in SNR.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260240/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4634593","isJournal":true,"volume":"40","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Relaxed look-ahead pipelined LMS adaptive filters and their application to ADPCM coder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relaxed look-ahead pipelined LMS adaptive filters and their application to ADPCM coder","sourcePdf":"00260240.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042372S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"44","articleId":"260240","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":260242,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The optimum residual-stress-compensation scheme for maximizing microphone sensitivity produces a slightly buckled microphone diaphragm. A model for the sensitivity dependence of device operation to residual stress is confirmed by applying external strain. The packaged microphone has a resonant frequency of 18 kHz, a quality factor Q approximately=40, and an unamplified sensitivity of 0.92 mV/Pa.

The scheme is based on the back-error-propagation algorithm and uses neural net emulators and controllers. The neural network models are trained using only the input-output characteristics of the plant without the need for using any initial conventional controller or knowledge regarding dynamics. The scheme allows online learning of the neural net emulators and controllers whereby their performance can be further improved. The approach is applicable to a wide variety of open-loop stable systems. Experiments are conducted to see how well the neurocontrol scheme compares with two established control schemes implemented for the same process. Comparisons are made with respect to set-point changes, load disturbance rejection, parameter variations, and controller saturations. The experimental results show that the neurocontrol scheme has considerable robustness and performs better than the other two controllers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/87.260269","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/87/6582/00260269.pdf","startPage":"238","endPage":"245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/87.260269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO furnace control with neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260269","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260269/","displayDocTitle":"MIMO furnace control with neural networks","volume":"1","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4647448","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO furnace control with neural networks","sourcePdf":"00260269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055746S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"49","articleId":"260269","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":260295,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

They model the excitation vector by a linear combination of K signals, which are issued from K codebooks and multiplied by K associated gains. They demonstrate that this generalized form incorporates several particular coders such as code excited linear predictive coders, multipulse coders, self excited vocoders, etc. The least squares minimization problem is presented afterwards. In the case of orthogonal codebooks, they show that the optimal solution of this least squares problem is equivalent to orthogonal transform coding. They use the Karhunen-Loeve transform to design the corresponding orthogonal codebooks. In the case of nonorthogonal codebooks, they are restricted to suboptimal iterative algorithms for index selection and gain computation. They present some new algorithms based on orthogonalization procedures and QR factorizations that attempt to reduce this suboptimality. In a particular case, when the excitation is modeled using one gain coefficient (for example, ternary excitation or concatenation of short codebook vectors), an iterative angle minimization algorithm is proposed for index selection.

This approach allows them to remove the need for using speech preprocessors, which conventionally serve a role of converting speech waveforms into frame-based speech data subject to a subsequent modeling process. Central to their method is the representation of the speech waveforms as the output of a time-varying filter excited by a Gaussian source time-varying in its power. In order to formulate a speech recognition algorithm based on this representation, the time variation in the characteristics of the filter and of the excitation source is described in a compact and parametric form of the Markov chain. They analyze in detail the comparative roles played by the filter modeling and by the source modeling in speech recognition performance. Based on the result of the analysis, they propose and evaluate a normalization procedure intended to remove the sensitivity of speech recognition accuracy to often uncontrollable speech power variations. The effectiveness of the proposed speech-waveform modeling approach is demonstrated in a speaker-dependent, discrete-utterance speech recognition task involving 18 highly confusable stop consonant-vowel syllables. The high accuracy obtained shows promising potentials of the proposed time-domain waveform modeling technique for speech recognition.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260337/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4647430","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"2","issue":"1","displayDocTitle":"Waveform-based speech recognition using hidden filter models: parameter selection and sensitivity to power normalization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Waveform-based speech recognition using hidden filter models: parameter selection and sensitivity to power normalization","sourcePdf":"00260337.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037836S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"7929814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"35","articleId":"260337","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":260341,"authors":[{"name":"B.A. Carlson","affiliation":["Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lexington, MA, USA","School of Electrical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"B.A.","lastName":"Carlson","id":"37341584500"},{"name":"M.A. Clements","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Clements","id":"37272395500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6676"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2353"}],"articleNumber":"260341","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":66},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Noise measurement","Additive noise","Density measurement","Hidden Markov models","Weight measurement","Colored noise","Automatic speech recognition","Speech enhancement","White noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic noise","hidden Markov models","interference suppression","random noise","speech analysis and processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["projection-based likelihood measure","speech recognition","automatic speech recognition performance","additive broadband noise","continuous Gaussian density hidden Markov models","weighted projection measure","cepstral-based parameters","normal speech","multistyle speech","noise signals","white noise","jittering white noise","broadband colored noise","speaker-dependent isolated word recognition","weighted Euclidean distance","WED"]}],"abstract":"Investigates a projection-based likelihood measure that significantly improves automatic speech recognition performance in the presence of additive broadband noise.

Saving bits in speech coders, for example, relies on a perceptual tolerance to acoustic deviations from the original speech. Perceptual invariance to adverse signal conditions (noise, microphone and channel distortions, room reverberations) and to phonemic variability (due to nonuniqueness of articulatory gestures) may provide a basis for robust speech recognition. A state-of-the-art auditory model that simulates, in considerable detail, the outer parts of the auditory periphery up through the auditory nerve level is described. Speech information is extracted from the simulated auditory nerve firings, and used in place of the conventional input to several speech coding and recognition systems. The performance of these systems improves as a result of this replacement, but is still short of achieving human performance. The shortcomings occur, in particular, in tasks related to low bit-rate coding and to speech recognition. Since schemes for low bit-rate coding rely on signal manipulations that spread over durations of several tens of ms, and since schemes for speech recognition rely on phonemic/articulatory information that extend over similar time intervals, it is concluded that the shortcomings are due mainly to perceptually related rules over durations of 50-100 ms. These observations suggest a need for a study aimed at understanding how auditory nerve activity is integrated over time intervals of that duration. The author discusses preliminary experimental results that confirm human usage of such integration, with different integration rules for different time-frequency regions depending on the phoneme-discrimination task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260357/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4647436","isJournal":true,"volume":"2","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Auditory models and human performance in tasks related to speech coding and speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Auditory models and human performance in tasks related to speech coding and speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00260357.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130045S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"114","articleId":"260357","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":260358,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The use of the hybrid system with the neural vector quantizer results in a 25% error reduction compared with the same HMM system using a standard k-means vector quantizer. The training algorithm can be further refined by using a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms.

Instead of using MLPs as probability generators for HMMs, the authors propose to use MLPs as labelers for discrete parameter HMM's. Compared with the probabilistic interpretation of MLPs, this gives them the advantage of flexibility in system design (e.g., the use of word models instead of phonetic models while using the same MLPs). Moreover, since they do not need to reach a global minimum, they can do with MLPs with fewer hidden nodes, which can be trained faster. In addition, they do not need to retrain the MLPs with segmentations generated by a Viterbi alignment. Compared with Euclidean labeling, their method has the advantages of needing fewer HMM parameters per state and obtaining a higher recognition accuracy. Several improvements of the baseline MLP labeling are investigated. When using one MLP, the best results are obtained when giving the labels a fuzzy interpretation. It is also possible to use parallel MLPs where each is based on a different parameter set (e.g., basic parameters, their time derivatives, and their second-order time derivatives). This strategy increases the recognition results considerably. A final improvement is the training of MLPs for subphoneme classification.","doi":"10.1109/89.260361","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.260361","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/6584/00260361.pdf","startPage":"185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayer perceptrons as labelers for hidden Markov models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260361/","displayDocTitle":"Multilayer perceptrons as labelers for hidden Markov models","volume":"2","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4647441","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayer perceptrons as labelers for hidden Markov models","sourcePdf":"00260361.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06076S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"20","articleId":"260361","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":260362,"authors":[{"name":"K.R.

The MNTN differs from the standard NTN in both the new learning rule used and the pruning criteria. The MNTN is evaluated for several speaker recognition experiments. These include closed- and open-set speaker identification and speaker verification. The database used is a subset of the TIMIT database consisting of 38 speakers from the same dialect region. The MNTN is compared with nearest neighbor classifiers, full-search, and tree-structured vector quantization (VQ) classifiers, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and decision trees. For closed-set speaker identification experiments, the full-search VQ classifier and MNTN demonstrate comparable performance. Both methods perform significantly better than the other classifiers for this task. The MNTN and full-search VQ classifiers are also compared for several speaker verification and open-set speaker-identification experiments. The MNTN is found to perform better than full-search VQ classifiers for both of these applications. In addition to matching or exceeding the performance of the VQ classifier for these applications, the MNTN also provides a logarithmic saving for retrieval.","doi":"10.1109/89.260362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/6584/00260362.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.260362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speaker recognition using neural networks and conventional classifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260362/","displayDocTitle":"Speaker recognition using neural networks and conventional classifiers","volume":"2","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4647442","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker recognition using neural networks and conventional classifiers","sourcePdf":"00260362.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070085S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"167","articleId":"260362","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":260363,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Kuei Chen","affiliation":["Telecommunication Laboratories, Ministry of Communications, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jung-Kuei Chen","id":"37384648100"},{"name":"F.K.

The algorithm has two distinct features: N-best hypotheses are used for training discriminative models; and a new frame-level loss function is minimized to improve the separation between the correct and incorrect hypotheses. The N-best candidates are decoded based on their recently proposed tree-trellis fast search algorithm. The new frame-level loss function, which is defined as a halfwave rectified log-likelihood difference between the correct and competing hypotheses, is minimized over all training tokens. The minimization is carried out by adjusting the HMM parameters along a gradient descent direction. Two speech recognition applications have been tested, including a speaker independent, small vocabulary (ten Mandarin Chinese digits), continuous speech recognition, and a speaker-trained, large vocabulary (5000 commonly used Chinese words), isolated word recognition. Significant performance improvement over the traditional maximum likelihood trained HMMs has been obtained. In the connected Chinese digit recognition experiment, the string error rate is reduced from 17.0 to 10.8% for unknown length decoding and from 8.2 to 5.2% for known length decoding. In the large vocabulary, isolated word recognition experiment, the recognition error rate is reduced from 7.2 to 3.8%. Additionally, they have found that using more relaxed decoding constraints in preparing N-best hypotheses yields better recognition results.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/6584/00260363.pdf","startPage":"206","endPage":"216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An N-best candidates-based discriminative training for speech recognition applications","doi":"10.1109/89.260363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.260363","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260363/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","displayDocTitle":"An N-best candidates-based discriminative training for speech recognition applications","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4647443","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An N-best candidates-based discriminative training for speech recognition applications","sourcePdf":"00260363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037379S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"37","articleId":"260363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":260364,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This hybrid system, called the combined system, is based on a combination of normalized neural network output scores with hidden Markov model (HMM) emission probabilities. The neural network is trained under mean square error and the HMM is trained under maximum likelihood estimation. In theory, whatever criterion may be used, the same word error rate should be reached if enough training data is available. As this is never the case, the idea of combining two different criteria, each of them extracting complementary characteristics of the feature is interesting. A state-of-the-art HMM system will be combined with a time delay neural network (TDNN) integrated in a Viterbi framework. A hierarchical TDNN structure is described that splits training into subtasks corresponding to subsets of phonemes. This structure makes training of TDNNs on large-vocabulary tasks manageable on workstations. It will be shown that the combined system, despite the low accuracy of the hierarchical TDNN, achieves a word error rate reduction of 15% with respect to our state-of-the-art HMM system.

In particular, the present work focuses on the problem of spoken word acquisition, using the authors' proposed principles to motivate a method to govern the emergence of word symbols from the speech signal. The mechanism involves a connectionist network embedded in a feedback control system. The resulting system has two unique characteristics. First, no text is utilized by the device, in contrast to all other speech understanding systems. Second, the vocabulary and grammar is unconstrained, being acquired by the device during the course of performing its task. This is also in contrast to all other systems, in which the salient vocabulary and grammar are preprogrammed. A rudimentary baseline experiment is described, involving 1105 natural language utterances in an automated call routing application scenario.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6584","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.260365","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/6584/00260365.pdf","startPage":"224","endPage":"240","doi":"10.1109/89.260365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An experiment in spoken language acquisition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","displayDocTitle":"An experiment in spoken language acquisition","volume":"2","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4647445","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260365/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experiment in spoken language acquisition","sourcePdf":"00260365.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081371S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"24","articleId":"260365","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":260635,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The author presents a systematic study of soft-error related problems and discusses methodologies for correcting single-bit and double-bit memory-cell upsets by using on-chip error-correcting-code (ECC) circuits. By modifying the product code, an effective coding scheme has been designed that can be integrated within a DRAM chip to correct double-bit errors. It is demonstrated that the reliability of a memory chip can be improved by several million times by integrating the proposed circuit. The area and timing overhead are calculated and compared with those of memory chips without any ECC and chips with single-error-correcting (SEC) codes. The ability of the circuit to correct soft errors in the presence of multiple-bit errors is analyzed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Error correction","Error correction codes","Capacitors","Alpha particles","Plasmas","System-on-a-chip","Product codes","Integrated circuit reliability","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","error correction codes","fault tolerant computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant three-dimensional dynamic random-access memory","on-chip error-correcting circuit","storage capacitors","plasma shorts","double-bit soft errors","memory-cell upsets","error-correcting-code"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260635","doi":"10.1109/12.260635","startPage":"1453","endPage":"1468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/6587/00260635.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6587","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.260635","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260635/","displayDocTitle":"Design of a fault-tolerant three-dimensional dynamic random-access memory with on-chip error-correcting circuit","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","volume":"42","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4604413","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a fault-tolerant three-dimensional dynamic random-access memory with on-chip error-correcting circuit","sourcePdf":"00260635.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058504S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6587","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"16","articleId":"260635","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":260637,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

For such problems, exact algorithms that always find an optimal solution are only useful for small toy problems, so heuristic algorithms such as the genetic algorithm must be used in practice. In this paper, we apply the genetic algorithm to the NP-hard problem of multiple fault diagnosis (MFD). We compare a pure genetic algorithm with several variants that include local improvement operators. These operators, which are often domain-specific, are used to accelerate the genetic algorithm in converging on optimal solutions. Our empirical results indicate that by using the appropriate local improvement operator, the genetic algorithm is able to find an optimal solution in all but a tiny fraction of the cases and at a speed orders of magnitude faster than exact algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.260665","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/6588/00260665.pdf","startPage":"1340","endPage":"1351","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.260665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6588","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evaluation of local improvement operators for genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260665/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"An evaluation of local improvement operators for genetic algorithms","volume":"23","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4598866","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evaluation of local improvement operators for genetic algorithms","sourcePdf":"00260665.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032619S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1993","isNumber":"6588","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"103","articleId":"260665","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":260667,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.P.

The neural network computing captures the designer's design concept and self-organizes similar experienced designs. The CBAPM (CLIPS-based assembly planning module), a component of CAAPS, generates a task-level assembly plan automatically. The design concept is expressed by a standard pattern format representing components' 3D geometry. A feature-based model translates the conceptual design into a preliminary boundary representation (B-rep). Based on a refinement of the B-rep assembly representation, assembly plans are generated for practical use in a single-robot assembly workcell. A feasible assembly plan that minimizes tool changes and subassembly reorientations is generated from the system. The CBCAPM presented draws input relationships directly from the conceptual design and the geometry of the assembly.

This optimization strategy is the source of the ELEANNE 3, a second-order learning algorithm for training single-layered neural networks with binary output. A simplified version of this algorithm, called ELEANNE 4, is also derived on the basis of some simplifying but reasonable assumptions. The two algorithms developed for single-layered neural networks provide the basis for the derivation of ELEANNE 5 and ELEANNE 6, which are proposed for training multilayered neural networks with binary output.

Teletraffic models are required for cellular system layout and planning and to evaluate tradeoffs in system design issues. The paper begins with a study of handoff rates in evolving cellular systems. Using simple geometry, it shows that in macrocells with homogeneous traffic the handoff rate per call increases only as the square-root of the increase in the call density. The situation is different in microcells where individual traffic paths become important and the homogeneous traffic model does not apply. Under smooth flow, the handoff rate along a traffic path goes up linearly with the number of new boundaries intersecting the path. Hence, in urban and highway microcells the handoff rate per call increases linearly with increasing call density. It proposes a parametric model based on results from vehicular traffic theory, that applies to vehicles and pedestrians in urban, suburban, and highway cellular systems. The model helps quantify various design tradeoffs. With reasonable parameter values, it was found that microcells are unnecessary in urban environments if the pedestrian penetration is small and that an architecture with microcells and overlaid macrocells is required only if a majority of teletraffic is pedestrian generated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.260744","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/6590/00260744.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.260744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6590","startPage":"673","endPage":"682","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Teletraffic models for urban and suburban microcells: cell sizes and handoff rates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Teletraffic models for urban and suburban microcells: cell sizes and handoff rates","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260744/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4592824","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Teletraffic models for urban and suburban microcells: cell sizes and handoff rates","sourcePdf":"00260744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037662S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"93","articleId":"260744","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":260745,"authors":[{"name":"P.A.

Human driving involves reaction times, delays, and human errors that affect traffic flow adversely. One way to eliminate human errors and delays in vehicle following is to replace the human driver with a computer control system and sensors. The purpose of this paper is to develop an autonomous intelligent cruise control (AICC) system for automatic vehicle following, examine its effect on traffic flow, and compare its performance with that of the human driver models. The AICC system developed is not cooperative; i.e., it does not exchange information with other vehicles and yet is not susceptible to oscillations and \"slinky\" effects. The elimination of the \"slinky\" effect is achieved by using a safety distance separation rule that is proportional to the vehicle velocity (constant time headway) and by designing the control system appropriately. The performance of the AICC system is found to be superior to that of the human driver models considered. It has a faster and better transient response that leads to a much smoother and faster traffic flow. Computer simulations are used to study the performance of the proposed AICC system and analyze vehicle following in a single lane, without passing, under manual and automatic control. In addition, several emergency situations that include emergency stopping and cut-in cases were simulated. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the AICC system and its potentially beneficial effects on traffic flow.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/6590/00260745.pdf","startPage":"657","endPage":"672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/25.260745","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.260745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6590","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260745","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous intelligent cruise control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent control","Humans","Remotely operated vehicles","Automatic control","Traffic control","Delay","Computer errors","Vehicle driving","Control systems","Intelligent sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automotive electronics","detectors","road vehicles","transport computer control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic flow","computer control system","sensors","autonomous intelligent cruise control","automatic vehicle following","human driver models","safety distance separation rule","vehicle velocity","constant time headway","transient response","computer simulations","automatic control","emergency stopping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous intelligent cruise control","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4592823","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous intelligent cruise control","sourcePdf":"00260745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052869S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"412","articleId":"260745","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":260746,"authors":[{"name":"R.

By effecting the lowest interference environment, in meeting a required minimum signal-to-interference ratio of rho per user, channel reuse is maximized. Distributed procedures for doing this are of special interest, since the centrally administered alternative requires added infrastructure, latency, and network vulnerability. Successful distributed powering entails guiding the evolution of the transmitted power level of each of the signals, using only focal measurements, so that eventually all users meet the rho requirement. The local per channel power measurements include that of the intended signal as well as the undesired interference from other users (plus receiver noise). For a certain simple distributed type of algorithm, whenever power settings exist for which all users meet the rho requirement, the authors demonstrate exponentially fast convergence to these settings.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260747/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","volume":"42","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4592821","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A simple distributed autonomous power control algorithm and its convergence","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple distributed autonomous power control algorithm and its convergence","sourcePdf":"00260747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079465S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1262","articleId":"260747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":260749,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Each cell can use any channel, subject to the interference constraints. Channel allocation algorithms are executed by the network switch in a centralized way.

As a figure of merit of network performance, they consider the blocking probability in the network as a whole, and the maximum blocking probability in any particular cell of the network (\"hot-spot\" in the network). They designed three specific channel allocation policies, based on three different objective functions. Compared with two other benchmark policies, the approach shows significant improvement. Performance analysis of various channel allocation policies is virtually impossible without simulations, which are prohibitively time-consuming in the case of small blocking probabilities. The authors propose an original approximate method based on a short simulation and an analytic approximation.

The sampled baseband signal is passed through a nonlinearity and smoothed by a digital filter. The magnitude of the filter output directly drives the clock recovery process. The phase of the smoothed signal is an estimate of the carrier frequency offset and is used for offset compensation.

Delay spread, which causes frequency-selective fading, is a major cause of error floors in high-speed digital mobile radio systems. The authors propose a new class of nonlinear-phase intersymbol interference (ISI) free filters that lead to asymmetrical pulse shapes and are more robust against frequency-selective multipath fading. The nonlinear-phase filters do not require redundant signalling bandwidth in comparison to raised-cosine filters which are more robust against delay spread. A piece-wise linear-phase filter with cosine roll-off is designed to demonstrate the robustness of nonlinear-phase filters against delay spread. Coherent quarternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) modems and the two-ray Rayleigh fading model are assumed in the analyses. For the filter roll-off factor alpha =1, the delay tolerance increases from tau =0.5 T (where tau is the relative delay of two paths and T is the symbol duration) for the raised-cosine filter to 0.65 T for the nonlinear-phase filter if bit error rate floors (BERF)=3% is used as a benchmark and the equal-power two-ray Rayleigh fading model is assumed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse shaping methods","Delay","Filters","Robustness","Rayleigh channels","Frequency","Intersymbol interference","Filtering","Fading","Land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","digital filters","digital radio systems","fading","filtering and prediction theory","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","low-pass filters","mobile radio systems","pulse shaping circuits","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymmetrical pulse shaping technique","delay spread","residual error floors","frequency-selective fading","high-speed digital mobile radio systems","nonlinear-phase intersymbol interference free filters","multipath fading","nonlinear-phase filters","piece-wise linear-phase filter","cosine roll-off","robustness","coherent quarternary phase-shift keying modems","QPSK","two-ray Rayleigh fading model","filter roll-off factor","delay tolerance","raised-cosine filter","bit error rate floors","ISI","Nyquist filters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260770","doi":"10.1109/25.260770","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/6590/00260770.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.260770","startPage":"425","endPage":"433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6590","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An asymmetrical pulse shaping technique to combat delay spread","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An asymmetrical pulse shaping technique to combat delay spread","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260770/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4592798","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An asymmetrical pulse shaping technique to combat delay spread","sourcePdf":"00260770.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080448S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","articleId":"260770","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":260771,"authors":[{"name":"G.J.

This probability, p, is studied as a function of the originating call load, in Erlangs per cell, with the number of channels and user mobility treated as parameters. Using simulation, the authors demonstrate that a simple ad hoc Erlang-B formula, based on an equivalent traffic load, gives an excellent approximation to p. The approximation is good regardless of the nature of the user motion or whether the cellular arrays are linear or planar. By the \"cost of mobility\" the authors mean the additional channels (in percent) that are needed to meet a required p because the user is mobile. Using the ad hoc formula, they show that the cost of mobility is generally minor, becoming appreciable only for high mobility coupled with low traffic loads. Two of the high-mobility examples consider 105-kmph user movement with only 200 m traversed per cell. Calls are assumed to have a one-minute mean holding time, and the value of p is required to be 1%. For a traffic load of 50 Erlangs per cell, about 10% more channels are needed with mobility than when there is no mobility.

Furthermore, in order to use these modulations in hand-portable equipment, power efficiency is also requested for the power amplifiers. To obtain both power and spectrum efficiency, a LINC transmitter can be considered. The authors present an analysis of the effect of different types of imbalances between the parallel signal paths in a LINC transmitter. The system degradations are described in terms of adjacent channel rejection, (U/sub R/). Classical raised cosine (Nyquist filtered) 4, 16, and 64 QAM modulation patterns are taken into account, and in all cases, upper bounds for adjacent channel rejection as function of the gain and phase imbalances as well as of the guard band between adjacent channels are presented. Moreover, the impact of these imbalances in the system performance, characterized by means of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increment needed to maintain a fixed error rate, is also considered. The results show that gain and phase imbalance between both RF paths could be a serious limitation for the LINC transmitter performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.260773","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/6590/00260773.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.260773","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6590","startPage":"399","endPage":"406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of QAM modulations applied to the LINC transmitter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260773","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of QAM modulations applied to the LINC transmitter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260773/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4592795","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of QAM modulations applied to the LINC transmitter","sourcePdf":"00260773.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081315S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"37","articleId":"260773","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":260774,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

With an adaptive array, the signals received by multiple antennas are weighted and combined to suppress interference and combat desired signal fading. In these systems, the weight adaptation algorithm must acquire and track the weights even with rapid fading. The author considers the performance of the least-mean-square (LMS) and direct matrix inversion (DMI) algorithms in the North American digital mobile radio system IS-54. He shows that implementation of these algorithms permits the use of coherent detection, which improves performance by 1 dB over differential detection. Results for two base station antennas with flat Rayleigh fading show that the LMS algorithm has large tracking loss for vehicle speeds above 20 mph, but the DMI algorithm can acquire and track the weights to combat desired signal fading at vehicle speeds up to 60 mph with less than 0.2 dB degradation from ideal performance with differential detection. Similarly, interference is also suppressed with performance gains over maximal ratio combining within 0.5 dB of the predicted ideal gain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/25.260776","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/25.260776","endPage":"384","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/25/6590/00260776.pdf","startPage":"377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal acquisition and tracking with adaptive arrays in the digital mobile radio system IS-54 with flat fading","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260776/","displayDocTitle":"Signal acquisition and tracking with adaptive arrays in the digital mobile radio system IS-54 with flat fading","volume":"42","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4592792","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Signal acquisition and tracking with adaptive arrays in the digital mobile radio system IS-54 with flat fading","sourcePdf":"00260776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026366S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"187","articleId":"260776","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":260810,"authors":[{"name":"T.L.

A PMU placed at a bus measures the voltage as well as all the current phasors at that bus, requiring the extension of the topological observability theory. In particular, the concept of spanning tree is extended to that of spanning measurement subgraph with an actual or a pseudomeasurement assigned to each of its branches. The minimal PMU set is found through a dual search algorithm which uses both a modified bisecting search and a simulated-annealing-based method. The former fixes the number of PMUs while the latter looks for a placement set that leads to an observable network for a fixed number of PMUs. In order to accelerate the procedure, an initial PMU placement is provided by a graph-theoretic procedure which builds a spanning measurement subgraph according to a depth-first search. From computer simulation results for various test systems it appears that only one fourth to one third of the system buses need to be provided with PMUs in order to make the system observable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power system observability with minimal phasor measurement placement","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.260810","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/6592/00260810.pdf","startPage":"707","endPage":"715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.260810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6592","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260810","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260810/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1993","displayDocTitle":"Power system observability with minimal phasor measurement placement","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1993","accessionNumber":"4485494","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power system observability with minimal phasor measurement placement","sourcePdf":"00260810.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04754S","chronDate":"May  1993","isNumber":"6592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"552","articleId":"260810","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":260811,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The objectives are to minimize real power losses and improve the voltage profile of a given system. Transmission losses are expressed in terms of voltage increments by relating the control variables to the voltage increments in a modified Jacobian matrix. This formulation does not require Jacobian matrix inversion, and hence it will save computation time and memory space. The objective function and the constraints are modeled by fuzzy sets. Linear membership functions of the fuzzy sets are defined and the fuzzy linear optimization problem is formulated. The solution space is defined as the intersection of the fuzzy sets describing the constraints and the objective functions. Each solution is characterized by a parameter that determines the degree of satisfaction with the solution. The optimal solution is the one with the maximum value for the satisfaction parameter.

Some fundamental issues, such as the effect of SVCs on a power system, how to control an SVC to improve system damping, and the differences between continuous and discontinuous control of SVC reactive power to achieve the maximum damping improvement, are discussed. A discontinuous SVC reactive power output at discrete points is determined from the power deviation on a transmission line.

A more rigorous approach that considers four torque (or power) components instead of the conventional single component is discussed. Using a modal analysis, the significance of these other components is revealed, the more comprehensive treatment using a generalized multimachine representation is justified and a reliable means for optimizing the PSS parameters is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modal analysis","Torque","Power system dynamics","Tuning","Power system analysis computing","Power system modeling","Power system reliability","Frequency","Power system interconnection","Damping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system stability","torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimachine system","modal analysis","power system stabilizer","compensation","electrical torque component"]}],"doi":"10.1109/59.260822","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/6592/00260822.pdf","startPage":"598","endPage":"605","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.260822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Refinement of conventional PSS design in multimachine system by modal analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Refinement of conventional PSS design in multimachine system by modal analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260822/","volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4485481","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Refinement of conventional PSS design in multimachine system by modal analysis","sourcePdf":"00260822.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054226S","chronDate":"May  1993","isNumber":"6592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"41","articleId":"260822","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":260823,"authors":[{"name":"E.J.

A conventional model for short-term operation planning for a hydrothermal power system is supplemented with a wind power model. The wind power model includes the forecast of total wind power generation and the uncertainty of the forecast. The conventional hydro-thermal model is extended to take into account load forecast uncertainty and reserve margins of the generation units. The requirements of instantaneous, fast, and slow reserves, depending on possible forced outages of thermal units and uncertain load and wind speed forecasts etc., are calculated together with the available capacities of the corresponding reserve type. The results include an estimation of whether there is a deficit or excess of instantaneous, fast, or slow reserves during each hour of the planning period.

The algorithm combines features from knowledge-based and statistical techniques. It is based on a generalized model for the weather-load relationship which makes it site-independent. Weather variables are investigated, and their relative effect on the load is reported. The algorithm is also fairly robust and inherently updatable, and it provides a systematic method for operator intervention if necessary. This property makes it especially suitable for application in conjunction with demand side management (DSM) programs. The algorithm uses pairwise comparison to quantify categorical variables, and then utilizes regression to obtain the least-squares estimation of the load. The technique has been tested using data from four different sites in Virginia, Massachusetts, Florida, and Washington.

By using Lagrange multipliers to relax system-wide demand and reserve requirements, the problem is decomposed and converted into a two-level optimization problem. Given the sets of Lagrange multipliers, a hydro unit subproblem is solved by a merit order allocation method, and a thermal unit subproblem is solved by using dynamic programming without discretizing generation levels. A subgradient algorithm is used to update the Lagrange multipliers. Numerical results based on Northeast Utilities data show that this algorithm is efficient, and near-optimal solutions are obtained.

They consider the inclusion of ramping constraints in both unit commitment and economic dispatch. Since implementing ramp-rate constraints is a dynamic process, dynamic programming (DP) is a proper tool to treat this problem. To overcome the computational expense which is the main drawback of DP, this study initially employs artificial intelligence techniques to produce a unit commitment schedule which satisfies all system and unit operation constraints except unit ramp-rate limits. Then, a dynamic procedure is used to consider the ramp properties as units are started up and shut down. According to this adjustment, maximum generating capabilities of units will change the unit operation status instead of following a step function. Finally, a dynamic dispatch procedure is adopted to obtain a suitable power allocation which incorporates the unit generating capability information given by unit commitment and unit ramping constraints, as well as the economical considerations. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.260859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6593","startPage":"1341","endPage":"1350","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/6593/00260859.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of ramp-rate limits on unit commitment and economic dispatch","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260859/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Effects of ramp-rate limits on unit commitment and economic dispatch","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4581940","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"3","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of ramp-rate limits on unit commitment and economic dispatch","sourcePdf":"00260859.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031611S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"287","articleId":"260859","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":260861,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

This approach uses a linear adaptive neuron or adaptive linear combiner called Adaline. An energy spectrum is used to analyze the periodic components in a load sequence. The load sequence mainly consists of three components: base load component, and low and high frequency load components. Each load component has a unique frequency range. A load decomposition is made for the load sequence using digital filters with different passband frequencies. After load decomposition, each load component can be forecasted by an Adaline. Each Adaline has an input sequence, an output sequence, and a desired response-signal sequence. It also has a set of adjustable parameters called the weight vector. In load forecasting, the weight vector is designed to make the output sequence, the forecasted load, follow the actual load sequence; it also has a minimized least mean square error. This approach is useful in forecasting unit scheduling commitments. Mean absolute percentage errors of less than 3.4% are presented from five months of utility data, thus demonstrating the high degree of accuracy that can be obtained without dependence on weather forecasts.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/6593/00260877.pdf","startPage":"1195","endPage":"1203","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.260877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.260877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive neural network approach to one-week ahead load forecasting","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Neural networks","Load forecasting","Weather forecasting","Input variables","Frequency","Parameter estimation","Power system modeling","Predictive models","Digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","neural nets","power system analysis computing","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low frequency load component","adaptive neural network","one-week ahead load forecasting","linear adaptive neuron","adaptive linear combiner","Adaline","energy spectrum","load sequence","base load component","high frequency load components","digital filters","minimized least mean square error","unit scheduling commitments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive neural network approach to one-week ahead load forecasting","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4581922","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive neural network approach to one-week ahead load forecasting","sourcePdf":"00260877.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038846S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"78","articleId":"260877","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":260881,"authors":[{"name":"G.K.

The generalized shell mechanizes routines traditionally carried out by human experts and that are essential to power-system dynamic security analysis, thereby greatly accelerating the realization of complex processes. The shell semantics express high-level goals and tasks using a friendly, highly compact syntax which closely matches the language of operations planners. Typically, the shell will execute appropriate load-flow and transient-stability simulations, perform result analysis, make input changes, and repeat this process until a user-defined goal has been achieved. A working shell prototype for performing key algorithmic processes is described and results of a typical sensitivity study are presented using a 700-bus model of the Hydro-Quebec network. It is expected that the prototype will reduce study-cycle time, improve the accuracy of dynamic security limits, and transform the working environment of operations and system planners. Eventually, the approach should gravitate toward supporting online dynamic security analysis.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4581911","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A generalized shell for dynamic security analysis in operations planning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized shell for dynamic security analysis in operations planning","sourcePdf":"00260888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032001S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"27","articleId":"260888","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":260890,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

The authors describe this process in more detail, point out that the use of numerical data are often inefficient, examine techniques presently used to improve understanding, find them inadequate, and suggest that proper graphical representations should create a breakthrough in understanding. The general question is examined of when and why graphics improve understanding, and when numbers are better. General representational techniques are discussed. Existing graphical representational techniques are examined, and the current trends in user interface development are evaluated to identify the benefits and drawbacks of different characteristics of these techniques. The characteristics of an ideal graphical representation are described.

Through case studies, the possibility of the application of the Hopfield neural network to the economic load dispatch problem with general nonconvex cost functions was shown.

The result is achieved by using a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) minimal realization algorithm based on singular value decomposition (SVD), which can explicitly take into account the critical impact of the input interactions. The resulting parametric model is a reduced order representation of the underlying complex system, yet it is optimal (in the least-squares sense). Besides compact storage of damping information, the balanced state-space realization as such retains the principal components of the response signals, and could thus be useful for the tuning of static volt-ampere reactive (VAr) systems (SVSs) and power system stabilizers (PSSs). When it is transformed in the modal space, the model also provides insight into modal interaction mechanisms. Several examples are included for illustration purposes and other applications and improvements are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system modeling","Modal analysis","Power system analysis computing","Damping","Power system interconnection","Power system simulation","Frequency","Power system stability","Power system transients","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system stability","power system transients"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static VAr systems","minimal realization approach","reduced-order modelling","modal analysis","power system response signals","small signal electromechanical responses","multimachine power systems","transient stability programs","multi-input multi-output","singular value decomposition","damping","balanced state-space realization","power system stabilizers"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.260898","startPage":"1020","endPage":"1029","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/6593/00260898.pdf","doi":"10.1109/59.260898","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A minimal realization approach to reduced-order modelling and modal analysis for power system response signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","displayDocTitle":"A minimal realization approach to reduced-order modelling and modal analysis for power system response signals","accessionNumber":"4581901","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","volume":"8","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260898/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A minimal realization approach to reduced-order modelling and modal analysis for power system response signals","sourcePdf":"00260898.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053275S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"75","articleId":"260898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-22"},{"_id":260902,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-T.

Features distinguishing the proposed approach from many of the existing methods include that it allows a more realistic problem formulation, and that it can find the (global) optimal solution. The new problem formulation takes into consideration practical aspects of VAr sources and the load constraints and operational constraints at different load levels. This methodology based on simulated annealing determines the location to install VAr sources; the types and sizes of VAr sources to be installed; and the settings of VAr sources at different loading conditions. To speed up the solution algorithm, the authors make a slight modification of the fast decoupled load flow and incorporate it into the solution algorithm. This method is suitable for large-scale power systems and has been tested on several power systems with promising results. Simulation results on the IEEE 30-bus system and the Tai-power 358-bus system are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/6593/00260902.pdf","startPage":"988","endPage":"996","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/59.260902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.260902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=260902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach for optimal VAr sources planning in large scale electric power systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reactive power","Power system planning","Large-scale systems","Power system simulation","Load flow","Capacitors","Annealing","System testing","Cost function","Energy loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load flow","power system planning","reactive power","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal VAr sources planning","large scale electric power systems","contingency-constrained","simulated annealing","fast decoupled load flow","IEEE 30-bus system","Tai-power 358-bus system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","displayDocTitle":"A new approach for optimal VAr sources planning in large scale electric power systems","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4581897","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach for optimal VAr sources planning in large scale electric power systems","sourcePdf":"00260902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035093S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"61","articleId":"260902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":260905,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

These somewhat conflicting goals are achieved by adding the speed-based stabilizing signals of two compensation filters, which independently provide the phase of adjustment necessary for adequate damping torques at two widely separated center frequencies (i.e., 0.05 and 1 Hz). Modeling of the open-loop system via the Prony analysis of the multimachine pulse response, followed by a root-locus study, made it possible to determine analytically the supplementary damping provided by the new PSS in the two frequency ranges of interest. Simulations of large disturbances on a realistic Hydro-Quebec transmission network with more than 59 machines modeled in detail confirmed that on a fast responding hydro-plant with significant installed capacity, the new PSS can add considerable damping to the 3c/min system oscillation, without any direct supplementary control of the governor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260906/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4581893","volume":"8","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An approach to PSS design for transient stability improvement through supplementary damping of the common low-frequency","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to PSS design for transient stability improvement through supplementary damping of the common low-frequency","sourcePdf":"00260906.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036251S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"57","articleId":"260906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":260907,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The W-matrix method, originally developed for the solution of sparse sets of linear equations on multiple instruction/multiple data (MIMD) computers, can also be made effective for vector computers. The recurrence problem is overcome by reordering the addition operations required in a forward and backward solution. Matrix partitioning is employed to find the best tradeoff between the number of fill-ins added to the W matrix and the increased efficiency of vector operations achieved through a reduced number of partitions. The effect of different bus ordering algorithms on the partition number is also considered. Operation reordering is employed to make the bus power computation phase very fast in comparison to traditional bus-wise calculation.

The authors propose new iterative and direct methods to compute load powers at which bifurcation occurs and which are locally closest to the current operating load powers. The distance in load power parameter space to this locally closest bifurcation is an index of voltage collapse. The pattern of load power increase need not be predicted; instead the index is a worst case load power margin. The computations are illustrated in the six-dimensional load power parameter space of a five bus power system. The normal vector and curvature of a hypersurface of critical load powers at which bifurcation occurs are also computed.

The three examples show the ability of dynamic simulations to study in depth all the phenomena taking part in the voltage collapses. The first example considers the case of an infinite bus feeding a reactive load through a purely reactive line. With this simple example, it is possible to show the basics of voltage instability. The second example illustrates the operation of a system on the lower part of the V, P curve. A two bus system is considered. The third example shows transient phenomena merged with mid-term voltage dynamics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.260913","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","startPage":"894","endPage":"904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.260913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6593","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/6593/00260913.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system dynamics","Power system simulation","Stability","Reactive power","Voltage control","Testing","Power systems","Power generation","Power system transients","Load modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital simulation","power system analysis computing","power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient stability","mid-term stability","voltage collapses","dynamic simulations","general purpose stability program","EUROSTAG","long-term stability","infinite bus","reactive load","voltage instability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic simulation of voltage collapses","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260913/","volume":"8","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4581886","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic simulation of voltage collapses","sourcePdf":"00260913.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026577S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"41","articleId":"260913","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":260921,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

This creates a controller that can be realistically implemented using only local measurements, and whose performance is consistent with respect to changes in network configuration, loading and power transfer conditions. The control differs in this respect from linear constant-gain controllers such as power system stabilizers, whose characteristics can vary significantly with changes in operating conditions. The design is well-suited to a multimachine setting, in that it is not based on an infinite-bus approximation. Simulations were performed on a 38-bus reduced modelof the Northeast Power Coordinating Council system and benchmarked against simulations in which automatic voltage regulators with power system stabilizers were substituted in place of the nonlinear controls.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/260921/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4581878","volume":"8","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Stabilizing a multimachine power system via decentralized feedback linearizing excitation control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilizing a multimachine power system via decentralized feedback linearizing excitation control","sourcePdf":"00260921.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038339S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"285","articleId":"260921","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":260930,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This detector, termed the effective negative-sequence impedance, is computed from the voltage and current phasors at the motor terminals.

High di/dt, high-energy single-shot experiments were first done. Devices without the amplifying gate performed much better than the devices with the amplifying gate. A physical model is presented to describe the role of the amplifying gate in the turn-on process, thereby explaining the differences in the switching characteristics. The turn-on area for the failure of the devices was theoretically estimated and correlated with observations. This allowed calculation of the current density required for failure. Since the failure of these devices under high di/dt conditions was thermal in nature, a simulation using a finite-element method was performed to estimate the temperature rise in the devices. The results from this simulation showed that the temperature rise was significantly higher in the devices with the amplifying gate than in the devices without the amplifying gate. From these results, the safe operating frequencies for all the devices under high di/dt conditions was estimated. These estimates were confirmed by experimentally stressing the devices under high di/dt repetitive operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/6596/00261003.pdf","startPage":"347","endPage":"354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/63.261003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.261003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6596","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=261003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-energy pulse-switching characteristics of thyristors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Thyristors","Switches","Temperature distribution","Pulse amplifiers","Frequency estimation","Pulse measurements","Temperature measurement","Estimation theory","Current density","Finite element methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rectifying circuits","switching circuits","thermal analysis","thyristor applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-energy pulse-switching characteristics","thyristors","silicon controlled rectifiers","amplifying gate","high-energy single-shot experiments","turn-on process","current density","finite-element method","safe operating frequencies","thermal analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/261003/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1993","displayDocTitle":"High-energy pulse-switching characteristics of thyristors","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4633709","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-energy pulse-switching characteristics of thyristors","sourcePdf":"00261003.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04927S","chronDate":"Oct.  1993","isNumber":"6596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"18","articleId":"261003","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":261004,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Its greatest attribute, in comparison with the full-bridge (FB-ZVS-PWM) converter, is that the voltage across the switches is half of the input voltage, This property is achieved due to the use of a three-level leg in place of the conventional two-switch leg.

Different parameters that will affect the dynamic behavior of the network include decaying constant, synaptic weight, initial state of neuron, input to the system, and the activation function. The issues of stability, equilibrium state, and convergence time are explored. The convergence time is affected by the choice of decaying constant. In addition, the discontinuous activation function presents several favorable features over the continuous sigmoid function from the control point of view. Because of the discontinuity, equilibrium state can be separated into active region and inactive region. The active region can be triggered through the excitatory input, if the initial state is in the inactive region. The state of the equilibrium point is 'directly modulated by the input, which implies a unique input-output relationship.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1991.261276","startPage":"150","endPage":"155 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 30th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1991.261276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6597","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 30th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/607/6597/00261276.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of dynamic behavior of a recurrent neural network for control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/261276/","displayDocTitle":"A study of dynamic behavior of a recurrent neural network for control","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4314764","publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec 1991","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of dynamic behavior of a recurrent neural network for control","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00261276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045213S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec 1991","isNumber":"6597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"607","citationCount":"1","articleId":"261276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":261277,"authors":[{"name":"Fu-Chuang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fu-Chuang Chen","id":"37087310571"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-0450-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"261277","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Adaptive control","Neural networks","Convergence","Neurons","Control engineering","Computer errors","Error correction","Computer simulation","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","discrete time systems","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","self-adjusting systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self tuning control","dead-zone","nonlinear adaptive control","neural networks","feedback-linearizable discrete-time system","input-output model","convergence","nonlinear hidden neurons","tracking error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=261277","abstract":"Layered neural networks are used in a nonlinear self-tuning adaptive control problem.

The problem deals with the case where a nonlinear plant is suitably parameterized and each of the different configurations contains an unknown parameter which lies in a compact interval. In this case, it is assumed that a nominal plant in each configuration can be identified off-line using neural networks. A stabilizing controller is assumed to exist for all the plants belonging to a configuration and was designed off-line using neural networks. The fault detection problem was carried out at the higher level by a neural network used as a pattern recognizer. The simulation results shown illustrate the operation of the entire system when a fault is assumed to occur.

An approximate solution is sought by constraining control strategies to take on the structure of multilayer feedforward neural networks. The approximation properties of neural control strategies are discussed, the terminal control problem is extended to the state-tracking control problem, and a particular neural architecture is presented. The original function problem is then reduced to a nonlinear programming one, and backpropagation is applied to derive the optimal values of the synaptic weights. Recursive equations to compute the gradient components are presented, which generalize the classical adjoint system equations of N-stage optimal control theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1991.261282","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00261282.png","startPage":"174","endPage":"179 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 30th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/607/6597/00261282.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 30th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1991.261282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-layer neural networks for the solution of generalized nonlinear terminal control problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-layer neural network","Nonlinear equations","Control systems","Cost function","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Computer architecture","Functional programming","Backpropagation","Optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","feedforward neural nets","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear programming","optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear terminal control","closed-loop feedforward control","dynamic system","cost function","multilayer feedforward neural networks","neural control","state-tracking control","neural architecture","nonlinear programming","backpropagation","synaptic weights","adjoint system equations","N-stage optimal control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/261282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Multi-layer neural networks for the solution of generalized nonlinear terminal control problems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 1991","accessionNumber":"4314770","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-layer neural networks for the solution of generalized nonlinear terminal control problems","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00261282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061255S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec 1991","isNumber":"6597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"607","citationCount":"2","articleId":"261282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":261283,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The associative memories of a human expert were learned from teaching data acquired from the expert. A recursive least squares algorithm was applied to identify the process state. The stability analysis showed that the parameter estimation always converges to the true parameter values and the overall system is passive so that its response to any finite input is always stable.

A heuristic load-balancing procedure is used to distribute the dynamic equations of a robot arm over a network of parallel-processors. The dynamics are divided into different subtasks. Each inter-related group of subtasks is assigned to one processor. This helps in minimizing the communication time between different processors. In this case, each processor will spend its time on useful computations and number crunching, leading to better utilization of the resources. The efficiency of this approach lies in its simplicity, generality, and cost-effectiveness.

A neural network for computing the filter gain is proposed. The Riccati equation is reduced to a series of linear Lyapunov equations following the method of D.L. Kleinman (1968). The neural network was applied to obtain the solution of the Lyapunov equation that in turn gave the solution of the Riccati equation and the Kalman filter algorithm.

They then employ some switching logic to turn on and off the adaptation as the state of the system proceeds from one region of the deadzone to another. A significant feature of the adaptive controller is the presence of set uncertainty. Thus, conceptually, adaptation is not only for unknown parameters, but also for the regions of the piecewise smooth nonlinearity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 30th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/607/6597/00261510.pdf","startPage":"2111","endPage":"2115","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 30th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1991.261510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1991.261510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6597","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=261510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive nonlinear control of systems containing a deadzone","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Control nonlinearities","Logic","Sliding mode control","Hysteresis motors","Relays","Friction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control nonlinearities","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deadzone","adaptive nonlinear controller","nonsmooth nonlinearity","Lyapunov-based adaptation","switching logic","set uncertainty","piecewise smooth nonlinearity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/261510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive nonlinear control of systems containing a deadzone","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4330094","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive nonlinear control of systems containing a deadzone","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00261510.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047778S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec 1991","isNumber":"6597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"607","citationCount":"101","articleId":"261510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":261511,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

This construction and the guaranteed uniform bounds were shown to provide the basis for stable adaptive neurocontrol algorithms for a class of nonlinear plants. The authors detail and extend these ideas in three directions. First, some practical details of the construction are provided, explicitly illustrating the relation between the free parameters in the network design and the degree of approximation error on a particular set. Next, the original adaptive control algorithm is modified to permit incorporation of additional prior knowledge of the system dynamics, allowing the neurocontroller to operate in parallel with conventional fixed or adaptive controllers. Finally, it is shown how the Gaussian network construction may also be utilized in recursive identification algorithms with similar guarantees of stability and convergence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1991.261511","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 30th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 30th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/607/6597/00261511.pdf","startPage":"2116","endPage":"2123 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1991.261511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable adaptive control and recursive identification using radial Gaussian networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=261511","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/261511/","displayDocTitle":"Stable adaptive control and recursive identification using radial Gaussian networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4330095","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable adaptive control and recursive identification using radial Gaussian networks","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00261511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033522S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec 1991","isNumber":"6597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"607","citationCount":"63","articleId":"261511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":261521,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.

By noticing that this design involves implicitly at each step a matching condition which is known to hold not only for one integrator but also for two integrators, they propose an adaptive controller with, in general, half as many parameters to update. A significant aspect of these designs is that, together with an adaptive controller, they result in a corresponding control Lyapunov function.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative designs of adaptive controllers for systems with nonlinear integrators","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 30th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1991.261798","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 30th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel2/607/6597/00261798.pdf","startPage":"2482","endPage":"2487 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1991.261798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6597","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=261798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/261798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Iterative designs of adaptive controllers for systems with nonlinear integrators","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4330141","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative designs of adaptive controllers for systems with nonlinear integrators","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00261798.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095541S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec 1991","isNumber":"6597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"607","citationCount":"32","articleId":"261798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":261800,"authors":[{"name":"G.

If the plant is free from modeling uncertainties and disturbances and the control input is not saturated for a finite period of time, then the closed-loop adaptive control system is asymptotically characterized by the desired closed-loop poles within this time period.

Basic ingredients consisting of tapped delay lines and standard analog neurons (with backpropagation) are combined within a modular/hierarchical architecture to implement an MRAC scheme having rigorous stability and convergence properties. Control adaptation is carried out in the presence of unknown (and possibly persistent) plant disturbances and instrumentation noise and requires no built-in modeling information. The overall adaptive neural controller is composed of a system replicator network and the control adaptor network. With no prior information, the system replicator autonomously builds an internal model of the plant, effectively identifying the plant within the closed loop. Simultaneously, this internal model is used by the control adaptor to adapt the online dynamic compensation so that the closed-loop input/output characteristics match those of the ideal refractive system. The efficacy of the proposed approach is illustrated by several numerical examples involving vibration control for precision space structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1991.261813","pdfPath":"/iel2/607/6597/00261813.pdf","startPage":"2552","endPage":"2557 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 30th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","publicationTitle":"[1991] Proceedings of the 30th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1991.261813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6597","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network architecture for online system identification and adaptively optimized control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/261813/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec 1991","displayDocTitle":"Neural network architecture for online system identification and adaptively optimized control","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4330155","publicationDate":"1991","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 1991","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network architecture for online system identification and adaptively optimized control","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00261813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03892S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec 1991","isNumber":"6597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"607","citationCount":"10","articleId":"261813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":261827,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The die area is 9.3 mm*8.3 mm and operates on +or-4-V power supply with 1.8-W power dissipation. The ADC is fabricated in an 11-V, 4-GHz, 2.4- mu m BiCMOS process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.261994","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/6600/00261994.pdf","startPage":"1207","endPage":"1215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.261994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 15-b 1-Msample/s digitally self-calibrated pipeline ADC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=261994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"A 15-b 1-Msample/s digitally self-calibrated pipeline ADC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/261994/","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4660571","volume":"28","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 15-b 1-Msample/s digitally self-calibrated pipeline ADC","sourcePdf":"00261994.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042433S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"306","articleId":"261994","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":261995,"authors":[{"name":"J.W.

However, the use of a two-level D/A interface results in a large amount of out-of-band quantization noise that typically must be attenuated by a carefully designed analog reconstruction filter. This paper introduces a means of simplifying the reconstruction filter design through the use of a semidigital finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter. In particular, it describes an oversampling D/A converter wherein a current-mode semidigital reconstruction filter is used to implement a multilevel D/A interface that attenuates the out-of-band quantization noise without requiring precise component matching. An experimental implementation of the converter achieves a dynamic range of 94 dB and 72 dB attenuation of out-of-band quantization noise for a baseband of 20 kHz. The prototype converter, which consists of a linear interpolator, a second-order noise shaper, and a 128-tap semidigital FIR filter, dissipates 59 mW from a 5-V supply and occupies an active area of 3 mm/sup 2/ when integrated in a 1.2- mu m digital CMOS technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/261996/","volume":"28","issue":"12","accessionNumber":"4660573","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS oversampling D/A converter with a current-mode semidigital reconstruction filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS oversampling D/A converter with a current-mode semidigital reconstruction filter","sourcePdf":"00261996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036528S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"59","articleId":"261996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":261997,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

The filter's performance goals are achieved through the use of circuit design principles that capitalize on the strengths of BiCMOS technology. The integrator circuits composing the filter consist of a new wideband low-distortion transconductor circuit and a unique BiCMOS Miller-stage circuit. Integrator time constants are determined by stable RC products, enabling a simplified filter calibration scheme that is insensitive to temperature-induced variations and requires no phaselock circuits. The prototype filter IC, consisting of seven integrators assembled in an active-ladder configuration, was fabricated in a 10-V, 2- mu m 2.5-GHz BiCMOS technology that also features thin-film resistors and polysilicon-plate capacitors. Measured results from the calibrated filter show passband flatness of 0.2 dB, with aberrations of less than +or-1 dB over a 100 degrees C temperature range. Stopband attenuation meets its designed goal of 60 dB. Driven by 7-V/sub pp/, differential input signals, the filter exhibits less than -72-dBc third-order intermodulation distortion products at 1 MHz.

The transconductors for the filter are composed of Gilbert cell transconductors. Distortion has been improved by feedback circuits without increasing the supply voltage and without using p-n-p transistors. The filter is a gyrator-capacitor type third-order Butterworth low-pass filter with a nominal cutoff frequency of 192 kHz.

This proposed implementation relies on the linearity of the passive resistors and the tunability of the current-steering MOS transistors operating in the triode region to overcome the limited linearity performance in continuous-time electronically tunable filters. By using the existing systematic feedback loops in the active filters and placing the nonlinear elements inside the feedback, the distortion resulting from the nonlinear devices is greatly reduced by the filter loop gain.

Experimental results from a 2- mu m N-well CMOS implementation of the delay generator demonstrate that it can achieve an output delay resolution of 101 ps while operating at 141 MHz with a peak error of 58 ps.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.262000","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/6600/00262000.pdf","startPage":"1273","endPage":"1282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.262000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precise delay generation using coupled oscillators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=262000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Precise delay generation using coupled oscillators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/262000/","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4660578","volume":"28","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precise delay generation using coupled oscillators","sourcePdf":"00262000.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053505S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6600","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"224","articleId":"262000","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":262001,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Soo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Micro Linear Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Sang-Soo Lee","id":"37351509600"},{"name":"D.J.

The controller is dual-mode. In a neighborhood of the origin, the control action is generated by a linear feedback controller designed for the linearized system. Outside this neighborhood, receding horizon control is employed. Existing receding horizon controllers for nonlinear, continuous time systems, which are guaranteed to stabilize the nonlinear system to which they are applied, require the exact solution, at every instant, of an optimal control problem with terminal equality constraints. These requirements are considerably relaxed in the dual-mode receding horizon controller presented in this paper. Stability is achieved by imposing a terminal inequality, rather than an equality, constraint. Only approximate minimization is required. A variable time horizon is permitted. Robustness is achieved by employing conservative state and stability constraint sets, thereby permitting a margin of error. The resultant dual-mode controller requires considerably less online computation than existing receding horizon controllers for nonlinear, constrained systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/9.262032","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel4/9/6601/00262032.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/9.262032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6601","startPage":"1623","endPage":"1633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust receding horizon control of constrained nonlinear systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=262032","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust receding horizon control of constrained nonlinear systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/262032/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4609668","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust receding horizon control of constrained nonlinear systems","sourcePdf":"00262032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033016S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"767","articleId":"262032","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":262046,"authors":[{"name":"Runyi Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey"],"lastName":"Runyi Yu","id":"37087143715"},{"name":"O.

The journey must be completed within a given time and it is desirable to minimize fuel consumption. It is assumed that only certain discrete throttle settings are possible and that each setting determines a constant rate of fuel supply. During each phase of the journey the power developed by the locomotive is determined by the rate of fuel supply. For each given sequence of throttle settings it has been shown that fuel consumption is minimized by finding an optimal duration for each phase. This suboptimal strategy has been called a strategy of optimal type.

Several experiments using MFP are reviewed. One successfully demonstrated MFP at megameter ranges; this has important consequences for experiments in global tomography. Some unique applications of MFP, including how it can exploit ocean inhomogeneities and make tomographic measurements of environmental parameters, are considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/48.262292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.262292","endPage":"424","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/6606/00262292.pdf","startPage":"401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An overview of matched field methods in ocean acoustics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/262292/","displayDocTitle":"An overview of matched field methods in ocean acoustics","volume":"18","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4660826","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overview of matched field methods in ocean acoustics","sourcePdf":"00262292.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104028S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"537","articleId":"262292","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":262295,"authors":[{"name":"J.-P.

A model-based matched filter is generated by correlating the received signal with a reference channel that consists of the transmitted signal convolved with the impulse response of the medium. The channel impulse responses are predicted with a broadband propagation model using in situ sound speed measured data and archival bottom loss data. The relative performance of conventional and model-based matched filter processing is compared for large time-bandwidth-product linear-frequency-modulated signals propagating in a dispersive waveguide. From ducted propagation measurements conducted in an area west of Sardinia, the model-based matched filter localizes the depths of both the source and receiving array and the range between them. The peak signal-to-noise ratio for the model-based matched filter is always larger than that of the conventional filter.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/48.262295","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","startPage":"447","endPage":"465","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.262295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6606","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/6606/00262295.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Matched filters","Fading","Acoustic propagation","Sea measurements","Acoustic distortion","Oceans","Signal generators","Predictive models","Distortion measurement","Loss measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","fading","fermium","filtering and prediction theory","signal processing","underwater sound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic model-based matched filter processing","fading","time-dispersive ocean channels","reference channel","replica channel","received signal","channel impulse responses","broadband propagation model","in situ sound speed measured data","archival bottom loss data","time-bandwidth-product linear-frequency-modulated signals","dispersive waveguide","Sardinia","signal-to-noise ratio","model-based matched filter","adaptive processing","time dispersion","sonar","Mediterranean Sea","590 Hz","490 Hz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic model-based matched filter processing for fading time-dispersive ocean channels: theory and experiment","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/262295/","volume":"18","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4660829","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic model-based matched filter processing for fading time-dispersive ocean channels: theory and experiment","sourcePdf":"00262295.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102735S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"43","articleId":"262295","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":262301,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

By discretizing this equation in space and time a finite-dimensional state-space representation is obtained where the states are the transverse displacements of the array from linearity in either the horizontal or vertical plane. The form of the transition matrix in the state-space representation describes the propagation of transverse displacements down the array. The outputs of depth sensors and compasses located along the array are shown to be related in a simple, linear manner to the states. From this state-space representation a Kalman filter which recursively estimates the transverse displacements and hence the array shape is derived. It is shown how the properties of the Kalman filter reflect the physics of the propagation of motion down the array. Solutions of the Riccati equation are used to predict the mean square error of the Kalman filter estimates of the transverse displacements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/262304/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4660838","displayDocTitle":"Towed array shape estimation using Kalman filters-theoretical models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towed array shape estimation using Kalman filters-theoretical models","sourcePdf":"00262304.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051715S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"36","articleId":"262304","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":262385,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

All serious plans for such a base require the use of lunar soil as shielding material against the Sun's radiation. Plans rely on the use of a large bulldozer-like vehicle to be driven by an astronaut, either locally or under teleoperation control. Brooks and Flynn (89) proposed an alternate approach to a single large and complex robot based on many small totally autonomous robots which trade off time to achieve the task with lowered complexity and cost of the system. In this paper the authors describe an experimental system they are building with 20 small bulldozers, which work without explicit coordination or communication, but nevertheless cooperate to achieve tasks that will be useful in building a manned lunar base. In particular the authors believe such tasks as digging out trenches in which the habitation units will be placed, stockpiling a supply of loose lunar soil to cover the habitation units, and actually covering them when delivered, can all be carried out by such small bulldozers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1990.262415","publicationTitle":"EEE International Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems, Towards a New Frontier of Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"EEE International Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems, Towards a New Frontier of Applications","pdfPath":"/iel2/183/6609/00262415.pdf","startPage":"389","endPage":"392 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1990.262415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lunar base construction robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/262415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Jul 1990","displayDocTitle":"Lunar base construction robots","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4071983","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lunar base construction robots","confLoc":"Ibaraki, Japan","sourcePdf":"00262415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031152S","chronDate":"3-6 Jul 1990","isNumber":"6609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"183","citationCount":"66","articleId":"262415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":262453,"authors":[{"name":"A.W.

Motion planning is formulated as a classification problem in which class labels are uniquely mapped onto the set of maneuverable robot motions. The neural network motion planner is an implementation of the popular adaptive error backpropagation model. The motion planner learns to plan 'good', if not optimal, collision-free path from supervision in the form of training samples. A multi-scale representational scheme, as a consequence of a vision-based terrain sampling strategy, maps physical problem domains onto an arbitrarily chosen fixed size input layer of an error back propagation network. The mapping does not only reduce the size of the computation domain, but also ensures applicability of a trained network over a wide range of problem sizes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1990.262453","startPage":"593","endPage":"600 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"EEE International Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems, Towards a New Frontier of Applications","pdfPath":"/iel2/183/6609/00262453.pdf","publicationTitle":"EEE International Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems, Towards a New Frontier of Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1990.262453","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network near-optimal motion planning for a mobile robot on binary and varied terrains","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Motion planning","Mobile robots","Navigation","Robot sensing systems","Robot vision systems","Orbital robotics","Path planning","Concurrent computing","Tellurium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning systems","mobile robots","navigation","neural nets","pattern recognition","planning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision free path planning","multiscale representation","near-optimal motion planning","mobile robot","classification problem","neural network","adaptive error backpropagation model","vision-based terrain sampling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/262453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Jul 1990","displayDocTitle":"Neural network near-optimal motion planning for a mobile robot on binary and varied terrains","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 1990","accessionNumber":"4076981","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network near-optimal motion planning for a mobile robot on binary and varied terrains","confLoc":"Ibaraki, Japan","sourcePdf":"00262453.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038851S","chronDate":"3-6 Jul 1990","isNumber":"6609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"183","citationCount":"2","articleId":"262453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":262463,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In this method, an artificial neural network is used with a conventional inverse kinematics computation module in parallel. The network automatically learns the manipulator model errors. When a manipulator carries out tasks, both the network and the inverse kinematics computation module receive the commanded end effector location, described in a Cartesian coordinates. The network output is summed together with the inverse kinematics computation module output in a joint coordinate. Driving the manipulator joint by summed result, manipulator endpoint positioning accuracy is improved. The effectiveness of this method was investigated experimentally by using a 6 DOF (degrees-of-freedom) manipulator forward kinematic model with model error. Results show that the absolute positioning error has been reduced by 1/3. Also this method was effective in a work area which was not used for the network learning.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1990.262466","pdfPath":"/iel2/183/6609/00262466.pdf","startPage":"635","endPage":"640 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"EEE International Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems, Towards a New Frontier of Applications","publicationTitle":"EEE International Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems, Towards a New Frontier of Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1990.262466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"6 DOF manipulators absolute positioning accuracy improvement using a neural-network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/262466/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Jul 1990","displayDocTitle":"6 DOF manipulators absolute positioning accuracy improvement using a neural-network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4076986","publicationDate":"1990","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 1990","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"6 DOF manipulators absolute positioning accuracy improvement using a neural-network","confLoc":"Ibaraki, Japan","sourcePdf":"00262466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053701S","chronDate":"3-6 Jul 1990","isNumber":"6609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"183","citationCount":"4","articleId":"262466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":262486,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The main contribution is the introduction of a new metric in the configuration space R/sup 2/*S/sup 1/ of such a system. This metric is defined from the length of the shortest paths in the absence of obstacles. The authors study the relations between the new induced topology and the classical one. This study leads to new theoretical issues about sub-Riemannian geometry and to practical results for motion planning. In particular they prove an inclusion relation of neighbourhoods in both topologies, which is the basis of an efficient obstacle avoidance local method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IROS.1990.262494","publicationTitle":"EEE International Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems, Towards a New Frontier of Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"EEE International Workshop on Intelligent Robots and Systems, Towards a New Frontier of Applications","pdfPath":"/iel2/183/6609/00262494.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IROS.1990.262494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6609","startPage":"765","endPage":"773 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A motion planner for car-like robots based on a mixed global/local approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=262494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A motion planner for car-like robots based on a mixed global/local approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Jul 1990","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/262494/","conferenceDate":"3-6 July 1990","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1990","accessionNumber":"4077003","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A motion planner for car-like robots based on a mixed global/local approach","confLoc":"Ibaraki, Japan","sourcePdf":"00262494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03999S","chronDate":"3-6 Jul 1990","isNumber":"6609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"183","citationCount":"24","articleId":"262494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1990","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":262538,"authors":[{"name":"D.Y.

The high-power amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), which is already in the single-mode fiber, can be efficiently divided into many channels by using an integrated optic wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) demultiplexer. This spectrum-sliced ASE can be used as light sources for WDM systems in place of several wavelength-selected DFB lasers. To demonstrate the principle, the 40-nm-wide ASE spectrum of an EDFA was sliced using a narrow optical filter (3-dB bandwidth: 1.3 nm), and the resulting source was used for the transmission of up to 1.7 Gb/s of data. The problem of spontaneous-spontaneous beat noise in these sources is dealt with. It is estimated that the total capacity would be about 40 Gb/s, realistically, since the channel spacing should be at least three times the optical bandwidth of each channel to avoid crosstalk.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum-sliced fiber amplifier light source for multichannel WDM applications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/68.262573","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/6610/00262573.pdf","startPage":"1458","endPage":"1461","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.262573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=262573","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/262573/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum-sliced fiber amplifier light source for multichannel WDM applications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"12","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4668173","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum-sliced fiber amplifier light source for multichannel WDM applications","sourcePdf":"00262573.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12472S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"194","articleId":"262573","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":262586,"authors":[{"name":"K.

These are very satisfactory for a CW or narrowband application. However, their validity is questionable for an instantaneous wideband excitation. Time-domain and/or wideband analyses can provide more insight and more effective terminology. Two approaches for this time-domain analysis have been described. The more complete one uses the transfer function, a function which describes the amplitude and phase of the response over the entire frequency spectrum. While this is useful for evaluating the overall response of a system, it may not be practical when trying to characterize an antenna's performance, and trying to compare it with that of other antennas. A more convenient and descriptive approach uses time-domain parameters, such as efficiency, energy pattern, receiving area, etc., with the constraint that the reference or excitation signal is known. The utility of both approaches, for describing the time-domain performance, was demonstrated for antennas which are both small and large, in comparison to the length of the reference signal. The approaches have also been used for other antennas, such as arrays, where they also could be applied to measure the effects of mutual impedance, for a wide-bandwidth signal. The time-domain ground-plane antenna range, on which these measurements were made, is suitable for symmetric antennas. However, the approach can be readily adapted to asymmetric antennas, without a ground plane, by using suitable reference antennas.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Baseband-pulse-antenna techniques","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","doi":"10.1109/74.262629","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel4/74/6613/00262629.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/74.262629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6613","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=262629","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/262629/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Baseband-pulse-antenna techniques","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646337","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Baseband-pulse-antenna techniques","sourcePdf":"00262629.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024869S","chronDate":"Feb.  1994","isNumber":"6613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"239","articleId":"262629","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":262795,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Intensity gradient analysis (IGA) is a robust technique for inferring depth information from a sequence of images acquired by a sensor undergoing translational motion. IGA obviates the need for explicitly solving the correspondence problem and hence is an efficient technique for range estimation. The design of special purpose hardware could significantly speed up the computations in IGA, which is a computationally intensive task. The authors propose two VLSI architectures for high-speed range estimation based on IGA. The architectures fully utilize the principles of pipelining and parallelism in order to obtain high speed and throughput.

Random sampling can be used to design parallel algorithms with fast expected run times, which meet or beat the run times of methods based on more conventional methods for a variety of benchmark tests. The constant factors of proportionality in the run times are small, and, most importantly, the expected work (and hence running time) avoids worst cases due to input distribution.

In this paper, the authors propose a current testing for CMOS static RAMs. Firstly, to see what influence a fault has on a power supply current, they analyze the behavior of a single memory cell when a fault occurs. It is found that almost all faults affect power supply current when a write operation is executed. Based on this analysis, secondly, the authors discuss a current testing scheme, where an address decoder structure is modified such that a write operation can be simultaneously executed on all the memory cells in a testing mode. In this current testing scheme, since the whole memory cell array could be treated as if it were a single memory cell, the length of the test sequences is not dependent on the size of memory cell array and must be very short. Hence, the authors believe their current testing method is a promising candidate for testing CMOS static RAMs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Records of the 1993 IEEE International Workshop on Memory Testing","displayPublicationTitle":"Records of the 1993 IEEE International Workshop on Memory Testing","pdfPath":"/iel2/471/6620/00263135.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A current testing for CMOS static RAMs","doi":"10.1109/MT.1993.263135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MT.1993.263135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=263135","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/263135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-10 Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"A current testing for CMOS static RAMs","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4577351","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-10 Aug. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A current testing for CMOS static RAMs","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00263135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048381S","chronDate":"9-10 Aug 1993","isNumber":"6620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"471","citationCount":"14","articleId":"263135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":263136,"authors":[{"name":"A.J. van de Goor","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"A.J.","lastName":"van de Goor","id":"37273366000"},{"name":"B.

This 'segmented' test pattern requires fewer cycles to execute, and in nearly all cases has at least the same fault coverage as the traditional 'monolithic' version of the test pattern.

The discrimination consists in learning a discriminant function from a training set of N examples. In a Bayesian context, the discriminant function is a probability function which is the probability of having the class C/sub i/ knowing the pattern to classify is x, denoted P(C/sub i//x) (or equivalently P(C/sub i/,x)). It is well-known that multilayer perceptrons (MLP) with a single hidden layer are universal classifiers in the sense that they can approximate decision surfaces of arbitrary complexity, provided the number of hidden neurons is large enough. Sometimes it is possible to decompose the classification problem, which requires a big network, into subproblems which are efficiently solved by simple modules (with a few or no hidden neurons). To each subproblem corresponds a cluster within the data set on which a module acts like an expert. If back-propagation is used to train a single MLP to solve the global discrimination, and thus to perform these different subproblems, there will generally be strong interference effects which could lead to slow learning and poor generalization; so for these many reasons the modular approach seems to be preferable. A number of authors have suggested to use a system composed of several different 'experts': one 'expert' for each subproblem. The author gives theoretical justification for this approach by constructing the global discriminant functions P(C/sub i//x) from outputs of the 'experts' which perform local discriminations within the previous clusters. In a Bayesian context, this means that one is able to construct the global discriminant functions P(C/sub i//x) by means of the discriminant functions for each subproblem. Two main hypothesis are posed; the experts have probabilities as outputs and information about clusters is available. The author looks for appropriate output nonlinearities and for an appropriate criterion for the update of parameters of the neural networks.

The signals employed for the investigation are frequency modulated sine waves corrupted by different kinds of Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise. In general, overlapping spectra of signal and noise require nontrivial solutions for removing the noise with minimal degradation of the signal. For this task a multi layer perceptron is trained with corresponding pairs of noise corrupted and noise free signal patterns. The trained neural network is tested by independent test signals from the same signal/noise generator used for training. As a reference an optimal Wiener filter is designed using the same information with which the neural network was trained. The performance of both approaches is quantitatively measured by the signal to noise ratio at the filter output for different signal to noise ratios at the filter input.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","startPage":"143","endPage":"147","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Third International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel3/1181/6622/00263239.pdf","publicationTitle":"1993 Third International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6622","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear noise filtering with neural networks: comparison with Weiner optimal filtering","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","filtering and prediction theory","noise","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","nonGaussian noise","S/N ratio","neural networks","Weiner optimal filtering","multi layer perceptron","noisy time-series signals","frequency modulated sine waves","overlapping spectra"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/263239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear noise filtering with neural networks: comparison with Weiner optimal filtering","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-27 May 1993","accessionNumber":"4577096","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear noise filtering with neural networks: comparison with Weiner optimal filtering","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00263239.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031666S","chronDate":"25-27 May 1993","isNumber":"6622","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1181","citationCount":"6","articleId":"263239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":263420,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The authors investigate the use of regular virtual topologies as an efficient solution that incorporates the above hardware limitations, while providing high system utilization and low end-to-end delays. The following regular topologies are investigated: Shufflenet, binary hypercube, generalized hypercube, and two-dimensional torus. A number of performance and hardware related metrics are introduced that reflect the use of these topologies in a high speed optical environment. Based on these metrics, along with upper and lower bounds developed for performance and hardware requirements, the authors evaluate and compare the selected regular topologies.

A key requirement for future ATM networks will be transparency, i.e. for the network to alter or manipulate the user information as little as possible. A transparent transport mechanism, plaNET, based on extensions of the current ATM standard and IBM's earlier PARIS technology, is proposed. It is shown how plaNET can satisfy the universal transport requirement of ATM, while avoiding some demonstrated deficiencies. In fact, plaNET could be viewed as an enhanced version of ATM that may be more suitable for the late 1990s than the current standard.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1992.263460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6625","startPage":"590","endPage":"601 vol.2","pdfPath":"/iel2/643/6625/00263460.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] IEEE INFOCOM '92: The Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] IEEE INFOCOM '92: The Conference on Computer Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1992.263460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network transparency: the plaNET approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Planets","Asynchronous transfer mode","Traffic control","Telecommunication traffic","Delay","Packet switching","Streaming media","Computer networks","Standardization","Routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous transfer mode","telecommunication networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network transparency","asynchronous transfer mode","high-speed universal networks","plaNET approach","ATM networks","transparent transport mechanism"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Network transparency: the plaNET approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/263460/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4347790","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network transparency: the plaNET approach","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"00263460.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053741S","chronDate":"4-8 May 1992","isNumber":"6625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"643","citationCount":"9","articleId":"263460","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":263476,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

They provide efficient cryptographic authentication methods for point-to-multipoint communication, where a single sender can broadcast (multicast) only one unconditionally secure authenticator for a message and which all receivers can verify. They further develop multipoint-to-point communication (incast) in which any subset (of a specified size) of a group of individuals can transmit a single authenticator (or a signature) for a message using the group's key. This method has been called threshold authentication. It is an application layer that is transparent to the receiver which only deals with the group as one entity. The bandwidth, computations, and storage overheads are reduced substantially when compared with the traditional approach. Threshold authentication hides some aspects of the internal structure of the group, which may be important in interenterprise communication.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-receiver/multi-sender network security: efficient authenticated multicast/feedback","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] IEEE INFOCOM '92: The Conference on Computer Communications","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1992.263476","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] IEEE INFOCOM '92: The Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/643/6625/00263476.pdf","startPage":"2045","endPage":"2054 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1992.263476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=263476","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/263476/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Multi-receiver/multi-sender network security: efficient authenticated multicast/feedback","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4353177","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-receiver/multi-sender network security: efficient authenticated multicast/feedback","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"00263476.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035238S","chronDate":"4-8 May 1992","isNumber":"6625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"643","citationCount":"60","articleId":"263476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":263483,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The results of extensive simulations to derive the average performance of the proposed heuristics on realistic network topologies are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code assignment for hidden terminal interference avoidance in multihop packet radio networks","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] IEEE INFOCOM '92: The Conference on Computer Communications","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1992.263490","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] IEEE INFOCOM '92: The Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/643/6625/00263490.pdf","startPage":"701","endPage":"709 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1992.263490","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6625","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=263490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/263490/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Code assignment for hidden terminal interference avoidance in multihop packet radio networks","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4347802","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code assignment for hidden terminal interference avoidance in multihop packet radio networks","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"00263490.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.118296S","chronDate":"4-8 May 1992","isNumber":"6625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"643","citationCount":"5","articleId":"263490","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":263491,"authors":[{"name":"A.-M.

In this model each Markov modulated fluid source generates priority and marked cell streams which are bursty, mutually correlated, and periodic during bursts. The output of many such sources is buffered and multiplexed for transmission. The loss priority is implemented by selectively discarding marked cells when the buffer content exceeds a threshold level. The equilibrium state distribution exhibits jumps, a feature not existent in prior fluid models. The computational complexity for two-state sources is dominated by a single system of linear equations of dimension equal to twice the number of sources, in particular, the complexity is independent of buffer size. The complete delay distribution for each traffic class is obtained. Numerical results are given. The analysis is generalized to several priority classes of traffic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/INFCOM.1992.263581","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] IEEE INFOCOM '92: The Conference on Computer Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] IEEE INFOCOM '92: The Conference on Computer Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/643/6625/00263581.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INFCOM.1992.263581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6625","startPage":"415","endPage":"425 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fluid models for the analysis and design of statistical multiplexing with loss priorities on multiple classes of bursty traffic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=263581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fluid models for the analysis and design of statistical multiplexing with loss priorities on multiple classes of bursty traffic","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/263581/","conferenceDate":"4-8 May 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4347771","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fluid models for the analysis and design of statistical multiplexing with loss priorities on multiple classes of bursty traffic","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"00263581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061896S","chronDate":"4-8 May 1992","isNumber":"6625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"643","citationCount":"61","articleId":"263581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":263604,"authors":[{"name":"V.G.

The result has a simpler architecture and can detect any number of module errors without any redundant moduli. In addition, it can tolerate L faults if L redundant moduli are used. Furthermore, the system also has the property of graceful degradation when the number of faulty modules exceeds L.

However, this figure is not compatible with the high accuracy of 0.3 K required by climate studies. Biases in the SST product, arising when the factors that increase the optical path-length (absorbents concentration in the atmosphere or viewing angles) are large, cause problems in the use of the split-window formulation for climate monitoring. The reason is that the split-window coefficients currently used are not adequate to cover for all the atmospheric variability. To show this, simulations of channels 4 and 5 of AVHRR/2 of NOAA-11 using a radiative transfer model have been made. The range of atmospheric conditions and surface temperatures introduced in the simulation covers the variability of these parameters on a worldwide scale. From these data, the authors present new split-window coefficients that take into account the atmospheric variability through the ratio of the channel transmittances, or else through the total water vapor content along the path. They also show, using simulated and actual data, that the proposed split-window algorithm has a real global character and represents an improvement over the conventional algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.263765","startPage":"946","endPage":"952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.263765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6631","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/6631/00263765.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of the atmospheric transmittance and total water vapor content in the algorithms for estimating satellite sea surface temperatures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/263765/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of the atmospheric transmittance and total water vapor content in the algorithms for estimating satellite sea surface temperatures","volume":"31","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4609851","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of the atmospheric transmittance and total water vapor content in the algorithms for estimating satellite sea surface temperatures","sourcePdf":"00263765.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042292S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"53","articleId":"263765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":263767,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This problem is of interest in seismic exploration, but also for nondestructive testing or medical imaging. The proposed approach consists of a multichannel Bayesian deconvolution method of the 2D reflectivity based upon a theoretically sound prior stochastic model. The Markov-Bernoulli random field representation introduced by Idier et al. (1993) is used to model the geometric properties of the reflectivity, and emphasis is placed on representation of the amplitudes and on deconvolution algorithms. It is shown that the algorithmic structure and computational complexity of the proposed multichannel methods are similar to those of single-channel B-G deconvolution procedures, but that explicit modeling of the stratified structure results in significantly better performances. Simulation results and examples of real-data processing illustrate the performances and the practicality of the multichannel approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.263767","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/6631/00263767.pdf","startPage":"961","endPage":"979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.263767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Multichannel seismic deconvolution","volume":"31","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4609853","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/263767/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multichannel seismic deconvolution","sourcePdf":"00263767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037122S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"41","articleId":"263767","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":263769,"authors":[{"name":"I.R.

However, most studies to date have relied on a method of moments technique involving second and fourth moments to estimate the parameters of the K distribution. The variance of these parameter estimates is large in cases where the sample size is small and/or the true distribution of backscattered amplitude is highly non-Rayleigh. The present authors apply a maximum likelihood estimation method directly to the K distribution. They consider the situation for single-look SAR data as well as a simplified model for multilook data. They investigate the accuracy and uncertainties in maximum likelihood parameter estimates as functions of sample size and the parameters themselves. They also compare their results with those from a new method given by Raghavan (1991) and from a nonstandard method of moments technique; maximum likelihood parameter estimates prove to be at least as accurate as those from the other estimators in all cases tested, and are more accurate in most cases. Finally, they compare the simplified multilook model with nominally four-look SAR data acquired by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory AIRSAR over sea ice in the Beaufort Sea during March 1988. They find that the model fits data from both first-year and multiyear ice well and that backscattering statistics from each ice type are moderately non-Rayleigh. They note that the distributions for the data set differ too little between ice types to allow discrimination based on differing distribution parameters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/36.263769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel1/36/6631/00263769.pdf","startPage":"989","endPage":"999","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00263769.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.263769","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood estimation of K distribution parameters for SAR data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=263769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/263769/","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood estimation of K distribution parameters for SAR data","volume":"31","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4609855","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood estimation of K distribution parameters for SAR data","sourcePdf":"00263769.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081686S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"118","articleId":"263769","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":263771,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Experimental results indicate that algorithm parallelization may result not only in improved computational time, but also in better prediction quality.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/HPDC.1993.263844","startPage":"174","endPage":"186","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings The 2nd International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing","pdfPath":"/iel2/465/6633/00263844.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings The 2nd International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPDC.1993.263844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel and distributed systems for constructive neural network learning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Computer architecture","Feedforward systems","Network topology","Neurons","Feedforward neural networks","Computer science","Heuristic algorithms","Workstations","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","parallel algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel systems","distributed systems","neural network learning","computational speedup","p4","Touchstone DELTA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/263844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Parallel and distributed systems for constructive neural network learning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-23 July 1993","accessionNumber":"4565646","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel and distributed systems for constructive neural network learning","confLoc":"Spokane, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"00263844.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03455S","chronDate":"20-23 Jul 1993","isNumber":"6633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"465","citationCount":"2","articleId":"263844","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":263849,"authors":[{"name":"T.Y.

Load balancing is achieved through the use of comb distribution to roughly assign the same amount of pixels to each processor first, and then dynamically redistribute excessive loads among processors to keep each processor busy. In this model, there is no need for a master node to be responsible for dynamic scheduling. When each node finishes its job, it just requests an extra job from one of its neighbors.

The inductive interface is a separable transformer providing a means to 'plug-in' an EV without the need for metal-to-metal contact of exposed conductors. The proposed design is 'universal' in that dimensions can be selected which will accommodate more than an order of magnitude range of power ratings without imposing significant performance degradation. Interface geometry standardization and the configuration of the core and windings are shown to have important effects on the demands on the user, the EV infrastructure, the distribution of stationary and mobile weight, and the power electronic converter requirements. Design methodology for the proposed approach is summarized and experimental results of a laboratory prototype are presented to verify the design theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Power Conversion Conference - Yokohama 1993","pdfPath":"/iel2/611/6639/00264219.pdf","startPage":"227","endPage":"232","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the Power Conversion Conference - Yokohama 1993","doi":"10.1109/PCCON.1993.264219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCON.1993.264219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6639","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=264219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An electric vehicle charging system with 'universal' inductive interface","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electric vehicles","Power transformers","Coaxial components","Conductors","Degradation","Geometry","Standardization","Power electronics","Design methodology","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery chargers","electric vehicles","network synthesis","power convertors","power transformers","secondary cells","standardisation","testing","transformer cores","transformer windings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secondary cells","battery chargers","power convertors","testing","network synthesis","electric vehicle","inductive interface","design","coaxial winding power transformer","power ratings","performance","geometry","standardization","core"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/264219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 April 1993","displayDocTitle":"An electric vehicle charging system with 'universal' inductive interface","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4552960","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-21 April 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An electric vehicle charging system with 'universal' inductive interface","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00264219.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043808S","chronDate":"19-21 April 1993","isNumber":"6639","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"611","citationCount":"33","articleId":"264219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":264252,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The model's most significant aspects fall into the following two areas: training process and selection of the input variables. Insights gained during the development of the model regarding the choice of the input variables, and their transformations, the design of the ANN structure, the selection of the training cases and the training process itself are described in the paper. The new model has been tested under a wide variety of conditions and it is shown in this paper to produce excellent results. Comparison results between an existing regression-based model that is currently in production use and the ANN model are very encouraging. The ANN model consistently outperforms the existing model in terms of both average errors over a long period of time and number of 'large' errors. Conclusions reached from this development are sufficiently general to be used by other electric power utilities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ANN.1993.264284","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00264284.png","startPage":"239","endPage":"244","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Second International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANN.1993.264284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6640","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Second International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/696/6640/00264284.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-term system load forecasting using an artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/264284/","displayDocTitle":"Short-term system load forecasting using an artificial neural network","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4590340","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-term system load forecasting using an artificial neural network","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00264284.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032364S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"696","citationCount":"9","articleId":"264284","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":264286,"authors":[{"name":"K.Y.

It requires fewer weights than FRNN and rapid convergence has been demonstrated. A dynamic backpropagation algorithm coupled with an adaptive learning rate guarantees even faster convergence.

The transient stability deals with the electromechanical oscillation of synchronous generators, created by a disturbance in the power system. For example, in the case of a transmission line fault, assume that faulted line section is first isolated and then reclosed (reclosure); there then exists a threshold parameter known as the stable critical clearing time (CCT). This paper describes a neural network based adaptive pattern recognition approach for estimation of the critical clearing time. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate this approach. In the neural network considered in this research work, a multi DSP-PC system (digital signal processor-personal computer system) is used for realizing faster backpropagation by applying pipeline operation and parallel operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/264300/","accessionNumber":"4590324","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based power system transient stability criterion using DSP-PC system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based power system transient stability criterion using DSP-PC system","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00264300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03508S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"696","citationCount":"2","articleId":"264300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":264301,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Also, the differential equation form of the time series is utilized to deal with the nonstationarity of the daily load time series. Furthermore, this paper proposes the diffusion learning method for determining weights between units in a recurrent network. The method is capable of escaping from local minima with stochastic noise.

The issue addressed in this paper is how to substantially reduce the amount of offline security assessment simulations used for neural net training. A Kohonen-based classifier is developed for this purpose. With the proposed scheme, the status of the system security is not needed for all training patterns. Only a selected sample of the training patterns needs to be assessed through simulations. Once the network is adequately trained, neurons that respond to secure or insecure states are self organized in clusters. In the testing stage, the pattern security states is determined by correlating the test pattern with a cluster of a known security status.

It is found from these investigations that the forecasting accuracy of the neural network is improved by utilization of the linear input-output relations of neurons.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ANN.1993.264323","pdfPath":"/iel2/696/6640/00264323.pdf","startPage":"349","endPage":"354","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Second International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Second International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANN.1993.264323","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of artificial neural network to forecasting methods of time variation of the flow rate into a dam for a hydro-power plant","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/264323/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"Application of artificial neural network to forecasting methods of time variation of the flow rate into a dam for a hydro-power plant","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4565702","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of artificial neural network to forecasting methods of time variation of the flow rate into a dam for a hydro-power plant","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00264323.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090141S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"696","citationCount":"2","articleId":"264323","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":264325,"authors":[{"name":"Kit Po Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia"],"lastName":"Kit Po Wong","id":"37087255174"},{"name":"Yin Wa Wong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia"],"lastName":"Yin Wa Wong","id":"37086966503"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1217-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"264325","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulated annealing","Scheduling algorithm","Processor scheduling","Temperature","Concurrent computing","Algorithm design and analysis","Clustering algorithms","Parallel algorithms","Computer aided instruction","System testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital simulation","hydrothermal power systems","load regulation","power system analysis computing","scheduling","simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydrothermal power systems","load regulation","digital simulation","systolic algorithms","clustered algorithms","parallel simulated annealing algorithm","short-term hydro scheduling","coarse-grained","design","load balancing","i860 processor","sequential algorithms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=264325","abstract":"This paper develops a coarse-grained parallel simulated annealing algorithm for short-term hydro scheduling.

A feedforward type of a neural network with three layers, i.e. input, hidden and output layers is used. It is found that the network which learns only corona and no noise patterns does not show a good performance. This means that the network should learn both corona and noise patterns even for recognizing only corona discharges. The network which uses frequency spectra of waveforms obtained by a fast Fourier transform (FFT) method as input patterns is also investigated.

A major difficulty, both for component-based and measurement-based methods, is the lack of data for dynamic load modeling. A way of solving this problem for measurement-based methods is to interpolate and extrapolate the models identified from wide voltage variation data recorded during naturally-occurring disturbances or field experiments. This paper deals with data measured in Chinese power systems using two models: a multilayer feedforward neural network (ANN) with backpropagation learning, and difference equations (DE) with recursive extended least square identification. A comparison between the two approaches was done. The results show that the DE models interpolation and extrapolation are nearly linear, and they cannot describe the voltage-power nonlinear relationship of load dynamic characteristics. However, the ANN models can represent well this nonlinear relationship, they are promising dynamic load models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ANN.1993.264338","pdfPath":"/iel2/696/6640/00264338.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"258","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Second International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Second International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANN.1993.264338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of dynamic load modeling using neural network and traditional method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/264338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of dynamic load modeling using neural network and traditional method","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4565687","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of dynamic load modeling using neural network and traditional method","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00264338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068488S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"696","citationCount":"12","articleId":"264338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":264340,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. El-Sharkawi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"El-Sharkawi","id":"37274576300"},{"name":"S.S.

To cope with harmonics, either conventional LC filters or active filters are used as additional compensators near the harmonic generating load. However such devices are not optimal when adopted as compensators in the power distribution system.

The performance of the networks are evaluated by forecasting the records in the years from June 1989 to May 1990. The average errors for all days in a week were 3.18% to 3.01%.

It is hoped that the resulting system will improve the quality of forecasting methods, through a better modeling of the nonlinear relationship between load and climatic factors. In view of the various aspects of the problem, the authors intend to develop a hybrid neural network (ANN)-knowledge based system (KBS) application: the ANN will form the basis of the system and will make the forecast in normal situations; the KBS should manage exceptions and special phenomena as well as provide specific knowledge-based facilities. The authors focus on the development of a prototype for the ANN.

The system detects fault type and approximate fault points using information from operated relays, circuit breakers (CBs), and fault voltage/current waveforms. Faulted sections are estimated by ES and the fault voltage/current waveform is analyzed by NNs. Since power systems require high reliability, the system uses a verification procedure based on CFAP for the result of NN waveform recognition. Four different types of NNs are compared and an appropriate NN is selected for waveform recognition. With NNs, ES and CFAP used together, the system can obtain the convenient features of these methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ANN.1993.264355","startPage":"20","endPage":"25","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Second International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ANN.1993.264355","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6640","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Second International Forum on Applications of Neural Networks to Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel2/696/6640/00264355.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault analysis system using neural networks and artificial intelligence","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/264355/","displayDocTitle":"Fault analysis system using neural networks and artificial intelligence","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4565670","publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-22 April 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault analysis system using neural networks and artificial intelligence","confLoc":"Yokohama, Japan","sourcePdf":"00264355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037707S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"696","citationCount":"5","articleId":"264355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":264357,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A fifth order Volterra model is used to represent the sampler's timing jitter distortion. They obtain the Volterra model kernels using either the Lee-Schetzen (1976, 1989) method and the relationship between the Wiener and Volterra kernels, or by using an adaptive method to obtain the Volterra kernels directly.

The PPT appears to be a practical approach to parametric modeling of a class of nonstationary signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/HOST.1993.264577","publicationTitle":"[1993 Proceedings] IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Higher-Order Statistics","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993 Proceedings] IEEE Signal Processing Workshop on Higher-Order Statistics","pdfPath":"/iel2/698/6642/00264577.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HOST.1993.264577","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"Parametric signal analysis using the polynomial phase transform","conferenceDate":"7-7 June 1993","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4547380","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/264577/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric signal analysis using the polynomial phase transform","confLoc":"South Lake Tahoe, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00264577.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033563S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"698","citationCount":"19","articleId":"264577","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":264739,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

Concerning the power distribution, solid state power controllers (SSPC) are proving now to be a mature product, in a wide range of current, from 1 to 60 amps. However, depending of their implementation in the electrical power network, as well as of the loads they control, their features widely differ. This paper is aimed at describing the main features required and the corresponding technical and technological innovative solutions for achieving them. Low current devices must comply with the most general requirements such as low ON resistance, high side and low side switching capabilities, short-circuit and overload protection, while high current devices incorporate more specific features like very low ON status drop out, active current limiting for large capacitive loads, fault tolerance capability, and internal DC/DC power converter supplied by the power network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"1993 Fifth European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Fifth European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/1147/6646/00264739.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"126 vol.8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=264739","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State of the art in solid state power controller for aeronautical application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/264739/","displayDocTitle":"State of the art in solid state power controller for aeronautical application","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4577175","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State of the art in solid state power controller for aeronautical application","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00264739.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035455S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","isNumber":"6646","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1147","citationCount":"3","articleId":"264739","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":264746,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The analysis is limited to integrated velocity and flux estimation methods that rely upon the induction machine back EMF. After assessing the limitations of a model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) approach, an improved topology utilizing an integrated closed-loop flux observer and a mechanical system model is proposed and experimentally verified. Given some knowledge of the machine load, the proposed observer can potentially improve both the velocity estimation dynamics and the transient low speed field orientation. However, it does not overcome the fundamental lack of robustness at zero speed and loss of accuracy due to parameter sensitivity.

Correlation of the device firing signals, phase current direction and flywheeling currents enable a fault to be detected. The system identifies the faulted device and its mode of failure, within the short circuit withstand time of the power devices. Accurate knowledge of the nature of the failure allows the bridge controller to take appropriate action to avoid propagation of the fault, which may lead to catastrophic failure of the bridge, affecting the power rails and associated systems.

Therefore they are able to form a self-organizing control structure in order to handle unknown or slowly varying plant parameters and nonlinearities. In this paper it is shown that the general regression neural network can be applied to a broad class of such systems. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated with a second order plant with unknown nonlinearity and unknown PT/sub 1/ parameters in order to perform input-output linearization. The neural network interacts with the plant to estimate and compensate the nonlinearity and PT/sub 1/ parameters. The learning scheme is fed by error signals generated by a comparison between the states of a reference model and the actual plant. It can be demonstrated that the overall system is stable in the sense of Luapunov. The attractive features of this approach are the high speed of the GRNN implemented in parallel hardware and the ability for constant learning in a changing environment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","startPage":"219","endPage":"224 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Fifth European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/1147/6646/00264887.pdf","publicationTitle":"1993 Fifth European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An application of general regression neural network to nonlinear adaptive control","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system analysis","multivariable control systems","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","self-adjusting systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system analysis","application","general regression neural network","nonlinear adaptive control","multivariable static mappings","internal weights","self-organizing control structure","input-output linearization","nonlinearity","PT/sub 1/ parameters","learning","error signals","reference model","parallel hardware"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/264887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","displayDocTitle":"An application of general regression neural network to nonlinear adaptive control","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4559212","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An application of general regression neural network to nonlinear adaptive control","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00264887.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029127S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","isNumber":"6646","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1147","citationCount":"8","articleId":"264887","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":264888,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The extension of hysteresis techniques to three-level modulation, which is common in high-performance inverters, is usually quite critical and complex to implement. In this paper a new hysteresis control system is presented, which is capable of producing constant frequency, three-level modulation. The technique is based on the concept of decoupling the contributions to the current error of the inverter phase legs and of the load midpoint voltage. A robust, simple control is obtained. In the paper the decoupling theory is developed and the control implementation is described in detail.

State feedback control is essentially suited for multi-input and multi-output systems such as these. A discrete-time optimal regulator is applied to their control because it provides a microprocessor-based robust feedback system without steady-state errors in response to a step reference and/or disturbance change. To obtain a mathematical model, only the fundamental component of the rectifier switching function is considered.

The number of electronic appliances has increased rapidly, and the state of the art is currently that almost all consumer equipment contains electronics. Electronic circuits prefer DC supplies and the sinusoidal line voltage complicates the construction of power supplies, since rectifiers cause current distortion and EMI problems. Thus, the authors investigate the suitability of different waveforms for the residential power network of the future. Three alternative voltage waveforms have been studied. These are a DC voltage, a 20 kHz square wave voltage and a 50 Hz square wave voltage. It has been investigated whether these systems are compatible to the existing mains and to todays appliances and consumer products. A power conditioner is described which is able to provide the considered waveforms. Finally, some measurements have been taken to illustrate the performance of alternative distribution systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"1993 Fifth European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Fifth European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/1147/6646/00265049.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"193 vol.7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Alternative power distribution in residential and commercial buildings","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=265049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","displayDocTitle":"Alternative power distribution in residential and commercial buildings","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4547192","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Alternative power distribution in residential and commercial buildings","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00265049.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.017885S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","isNumber":"6646","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1147","citationCount":"10","articleId":"265049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":265056,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Linearities like blanking time, voltage drop across the power devices and DC link voltage ripple cause torque and speed fluctuations in the AC machine. Different techniques are proposed and tested for eliminating these nonlinearities. The blanking time compensation is done by both a phase current feedforward and a voltage vector feedback. The voltage drop compensation is realized with a current feedforward and finally the DC link voltage ripple is compensated by a feedforward of the measured DC link voltage. A comparison and the influence of the different compensation techniques are done on a 16-bit microcontroller based PWM-VSI inverter. Test results show a significant improved performance of the AC machine at no load and at low speed when the compensation techniques are used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"1993 Fifth European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Fifth European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/1147/6646/00265084.pdf","startPage":"501","endPage":"507 vol.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6646","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=265084","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ideal PWM-VSI inverter with feedforward and feedback compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","displayDocTitle":"An ideal PWM-VSI inverter with feedforward and feedback compensation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265084/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4547157","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ideal PWM-VSI inverter with feedforward and feedback compensation","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00265084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.01491S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","isNumber":"6646","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1147","citationCount":"43","articleId":"265084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":265136,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Mains side current shape and fundamental power factor are problems that arise using this type of drives. Therefore, recent developments tend to use induction machines fed by voltage source inverters (VSIs) also for high power drives. Inherent advantages are: a simple and less expensive induction motor which leads to an overall economic solution with a good power factor over the whole operation range. However, the switching and snubber losses of the gate turn-off thyristors (GTOs) limit the switching frequency to only a few hundred Hertz. This leads to severe drawbacks: high harmonics: low efficiency, and low maximum speed. In order to eliminate these drawbacks, the paper presents and compares improved solutions: combinations with series connected 2-level and 3-level VSIs and motors with 3 and 6 connections to the windings.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"1993 Fifth European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Fifth European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/1147/6646/00265146.pdf","startPage":"7","endPage":"14 vol.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Configurations of high-power voltage source inverter drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=265146","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265146/","displayDocTitle":"Configurations of high-power voltage source inverter drives","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4547095","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Configurations of high-power voltage source inverter drives","confLoc":"Brighton, UK","sourcePdf":"00265146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020829S","chronDate":"13-16 Sept. 1993","isNumber":"6646","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1147","citationCount":"134","articleId":"265146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":265159,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Three categories of problems are considered, depending upon whether the features are two (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) and the type of correspondence: a) 3D to 3D (i.e., locations of corresponding features in 3D space are known at two different times), b) 2D to 3D (i.e., locations of features in 3D space and their projection on the camera plane are known, and c) 2D to 2D (i.e., projections of features on the camera plane are known at two different times). Features considered include points, straight lines, curved lines, and corners. Emphasis is on problem formulation, efficient algorithms for solution, existence and uniqueness of solutions, and sensitivity of solutions to noise in the observed data. Algorithms described have been used in a variety of applications. Some of these are: a) positioning and navigating 3D objects in a 3D world, b) camera calibration, i.e., determining location and orientation of a camera by observing 3D features whose location is known, c) estimating motion and structure of moving objects relative to a camera. We mention some of the mathematical techniques borrowed from algebraic geometry, projective geometry, and homotopy theory that are required to solve these problems, list unsolved problems, and give some directions for future research.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1994","volume":"82","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646693","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Motion and structure from feature correspondences: a review","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion and structure from feature correspondences: a review","sourcePdf":"00265351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073462S","chronDate":"Feb.  1994","isNumber":"6650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"320","articleId":"265351","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":265355,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Symbolic analysis is defined as a technique generating a closed-form analytic expression for a circuit characteristic with the circuit's elements represented by symbols. Such analytic information complements the results from numerical simulations. The paper then describes the different application areas of symbolic analysis for the design of analog circuits. Symbolic analysis is mainly used as a means to obtain insight into a circuit's behavior, to generate analytic models for automated circuit sizing, and in applications requiring the repetitive evaluation of circuit characteristics. Next, the present capabilities and limitations of symbolic analysis, both in functionality and efficiency, are discussed. The major symbolic analysis methods are presented, and algorithmic details are provided for symbolic approximation, hierarchical decomposition, and symbolic distortion analysis.

Problems of this class, however, often prove to have a response which does not depend on the speed of light. The examples presented here show cases where internal fields do not change if c is reduced by as much as five orders of magnitude. This permits /spl Delta/t to be proportionally increased. For simplicity much of this paper is restricted to one dimension, although generalization to three dimensions is also presented. The author considers an aluminum enclosure. Initially, the transient field will induce eddy currents on the enclosure which exactly cancel the external field and exclude it from the enclosure interior. This scheme has been, in fact, proposed to shield large systems which contain magnetic memories.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/15.265477","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","startPage":"32","endPage":"39","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/6653/00265477.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.265477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) analysis of magnetic diffusion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Magnetic analysis","Eddy currents","Aluminum","Maxwell equations","Steel","Magnetic fields","Magnetic memory","Diffusion processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic shielding","electromagnetic compatibility","electromagnetic induction","finite difference time-domain analysis","electromagnetic field theory","eddy currents"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite-difference time-domain","FDTD analysis","very slow waveforms","very long diffusion times","Courant stability condition","internal fields","EMC","aluminum enclosure","transient field","eddy currents","magnetic memories","magnetic shielding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) analysis of magnetic diffusion","volume":"36","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4644750","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265477/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) analysis of magnetic diffusion","sourcePdf":"00265477.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031607S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"65","articleId":"265477","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":265490,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Analytical expressions are derived for the corresponding tradeoff curves. In general, the initial parts of the curves have a steep slope. This means that an appreciable portion of the maximum shaping gain, corresponding to a spherical region, can be achieved with a small value of CER/sub s/, PAR. The technique of shell mapping is introduced. This is a change of variable which maps the optimum shaping region to a hypercube truncated within a simplex. This mapping is a useful tool in computing the performance, and also in facilitating the addressing of the optimum shaping region. Using the shell mapping, a practical addressing scheme is presented that achieves a point on the optimum tradeoff curves. For dimensionalities around 12, the point achieved is located near the knee of the corresponding tradeoff curve. For larger dimensionalities, a general shaping region with two degrees of freedom is used. This region provides more flexibility in selecting the tradeoff point.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.265491","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"1799","endPage":"1808","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6654/00265491.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.265491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shaping multidimensional signal spaces.

The authors describe some practical means for selecting the boundary so as to achieve a point with low addressing complexity near the knee of the corresponding tradeoff curves (shaping gain versus CER/sub s/ or PAR). One class of addressing schemes is based on using a lookup table. A method to facilitate the realization of the addressing lookup table is introduced. This method is based on the decomposition of addressing into a hierarchy of addressing steps, each of a low complexity. This avoids exponential growth of the complexity. Using this addressing decomposition and a memory of a practical size, one can move along a tradeoff curve which has negligible suboptimality. Another class of addressing schemes is based on using a Voronoi constellation in a space of half the original dimensionality.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.265493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6654/00265493.pdf","startPage":"1809","endPage":"1819","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.265493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shaping multidimensional signal spaces.

It is assumed that the i.i.d. sensor data are quantized locally into m-ary messages and transmitted to the fusion center for binary hypothesis testing. The boundedness of the second moment of the postquantization log-likelihood ratio is examined in relation to the asymptotic error exponent. It is found that, when that second moment is unbounded, the Neyman-Pearson error exponent can become a function of the test level, whereas the Bayes error exponent remains, as previously conjectured by J.N. Tsitsiklis, (1986), unaffected. Large deviations techniques are also used to show that in Bayes testing the equivalence of absolutely optimal and best identical-quantizer systems is not limited to error exponents, but extends to the actual Bayes error probabilities up to a multiplicative constant.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.265495","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6654/00265495.pdf","startPage":"1847","endPage":"1863","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.265495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New asymptotic results in parallel distributed detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=265495","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265495/","displayDocTitle":"New asymptotic results in parallel distributed detection","volume":"39","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4660601","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New asymptotic results in parallel distributed detection","sourcePdf":"00265495.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034195S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"34","articleId":"265495","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":265502,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The approach handles many of the previously analyzed input sequences in addition to a large class of new input sequences. By averaging over the arbitrarily small amount of circuit noise assumed to be present at the analog input to the Delta Sigma modulator, a simple expression for the autocorrelation of the quantization error is derived. Each term in the expression is formally equal to the quantization error of a nonoverloaded uniform quantizer operating upon a finite partial sum of consecutive input sequence samples. Hence, existing results concerning uniform quantizers are directly applicable in evaluating the autocorrelation expression for specific input sequences. The theory is also applicable to deterministic input sequences, and has been applied to obtain a new closed-form result for sinusoidal input sequences. Ergodic results which assert that, under mild conditions, the autocorrelation equals the time-average autocorrelation in probability are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265502/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","volume":"39","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"4660608","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Granular quantization noise in the first-order delta-sigma modulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Granular quantization noise in the first-order delta-sigma modulator","sourcePdf":"00265502.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037185S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"16","articleId":"265502","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":265504,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Since the minimization problem associated with these transformations is NP complete, a new fast iterative improvement probabilistic algorithm has been developed.

When added to the straight-line code generated by a compiled simulator, gateways can be used to enhance the performance of the generated code by switching only those segments of code that actually need to be executed into the instruction stream. The convergence algorithm is an oblivious compiled code algorithm that can be used with many different types of circuits, including cyclic asynchronous circuits. In its oblivious form, the convergence algorithm provides only modest gains in performance over interpreted event-driven simulation, but with the addition of gateways, the performance of the algorithm increases significantly. Experimental data shows that with gateways, the convergence algorithm runs in about 1/5th the time required for an interpreted event-driven simulation. Additional work has been done to reduce the amount of code generated by the convergence algorithm, and to enhance the locality of the code to improve its performance on machines with caches. When used with a multi-delay algorithm, gateways allow simulations to be performed in 1/3 the time required by interpreted simulations. Gateways also allow zero-delay simulations to be more responsive to the activity rate of the circuit, and allow event driven simulations to outperform levelized compiled code when the activity rate of the circuit falls below 13%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6661","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.265675","doi":"10.1109/43.265675","startPage":"338","endPage":"352","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/6661/00265675.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=265675","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265675/","displayDocTitle":"Gateways: a technique for adding event-driven behavior to compiled simulations","volume":"13","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4643615","publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gateways: a technique for adding event-driven behavior to compiled simulations","sourcePdf":"00265675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034467S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6661","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"6","articleId":"265675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":265677,"authors":[{"name":"V.H.

The possible detection of this defect by current testing is explored in fully complementary CMOS circuits. The behavior of a transistor with its floating gate is modeled using the coupling capacitances in the floating gate and the charge in the transistor gate. The poly-bulk and metal-poly capacitances are found to be two significant parameters in determining the degree of conduction on the affected transistor. The induced voltage in the floating gate and the quiescent current are estimated by analytical expressions. The model is compared with SPICE 2 simulations. Good agreement is observed between the simple analytical expressions, simulations and experimental measures performed on defective circuits.

The technique simplifies the message transmission processes and reduces the number of generated messages by using preassigned backup virtual paths. Next, the scheme used to design the backup VP routes and spare resource distribution for each link is proposed in order to create a network that applies the proposed restoration scheme.

As these networks will be increasingly relied upon for providing a multitude of integrated voice, data, and video services, network reliability is a key concern. There are several intrinsic features of ATM networks that could potentially be exploited to provide improved restoration techniques, beyond those established for synchronous transfer mode (STM) networks, such as digital cross-connect restoration or self-healing rings. These features include ATM cell level error detection, inherent rate adaptation and nonhierarchical multiplexing. The authors explore the use of these features in developing fast restoration strategies for ATM networks. In particular, they address: (1) ATM error detection capabilities for enhanced failure detection, (2) network rerouting strategies, (3) spare capacity allocation, and (4) network control architecture and related implementation aspects. Their findings suggest that fast network span failure detection and bandwidth-efficient rerouting capabilities can be combined to develop restoration strategies for ATM networks with significantly greater performance-cost ratios when compared to existing STM network restoration strategies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265712/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","volume":"12","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4644183","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast restoration of ATM networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast restoration of ATM networks","sourcePdf":"00265712.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066299S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"112","articleId":"265712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":265715,"authors":[{"name":"K.-I.

So far, they have been based on electrical technologies. This paper highlights WDM/FDM techniques and demonstrates that optical paths can greatly enhance the path layer capability and, therefore, the network performance. It is also shown that effective network failure restoration can be achieved with optical paths. The applicability of the wavelength path (WP) technique to global area networks is revealed by comparing different optical path realization techniques. WPs are applied to the national backbone network example to evaluate the required number of wavelengths, and to identify optical cross-connect node requirements. It then proposes a new optical path concept: the virtual wavelength path (VWP). In the VWP scheme, wavelengths are assigned on a link-by-link basis. In other words, the wavelength assigned to a wavelength path has only local significance. Significant benefits of the VWP such as the simplified path accommodation design within a transmission facility network and the reduced number of wavelengths needed, are elucidated. An optical cross-connect node architecture that enables the VWPs is also proposed. The architecture allows the VWP concept to be realized with commercially available optical technologies. The optical path layer concept proposed exploits and consolidates the layered transport network architecture and optical technologies, and will open up new opportunities for creating a B-ISDN that is bandwidth abundant and has a high degree of integrity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.265715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/6663/00265715.pdf","startPage":"159","endPage":"170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.265715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network performance and integrity enhancement with optical path layer technologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=265715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265715/","displayDocTitle":"Network performance and integrity enhancement with optical path layer technologies","volume":"12","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4644186","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network performance and integrity enhancement with optical path layer technologies","sourcePdf":"00265715.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055819S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"193","articleId":"265715","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":265732,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Analytical expressions of the profiles of the carrier density, spontaneous emission, and amplified fields are obtained for amplifiers with arbitrary facet reflectivities. The nonuniformity of the carrier density is demonstrated in the case of low facet reflectivities. The model predicts the output saturation power and gain ripple, with good agreement with experimental results in resonant and traveling-wave amplifiers. Very low-gain ripple measured in low facet reflectivities amplifiers is explained by the model. A comparison with the uniform gain model shows that important deviations can occur in the case of low facet reflectivities.

Two types of data modulations are considered: ASK and large-deviation CPFSK. Each user's narrow-band information is spread by the use of an electrooptic phase modulator. The sequences considered are bipolar Kasami and Gold codes. The receiver consists of an optical filter of bandwidth /spl ap/1/T, to filter the interfering signals, followed by simple, noncoherent detection. We thereby avoid all the difficulties usually met with coherent detection. Moreover, this type of demodulation is particularly suitable for a hybrid WDMA/CDMA (wavelength-division multiple access/code division multiple access) system where the spread-spectrum technique allows multiple users to share the same wavelength, thereby increasing the capacity of the network. Results are given in terms of the number of interfering signals that can be tolerated for different code periods N, and for an acceptable P/sub e/.

Similar power characteristics, but with considerably shorter response times (ns) and lengths (sub-mm), are predicted for dopants with a high oscillator strength transition, or a power-length product ten orders of magnitude smaller than for switches based on the Kerr effect in undoped silica fibers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1994","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4644258","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A model of nonlinear all-optical switching in doped fibers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model of nonlinear all-optical switching in doped fibers","sourcePdf":"00265747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080304S","chronDate":"Jan 1994","isNumber":"6664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"15","articleId":"265747","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":265812,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The filter is based on the normalized least mean square (LMS) error algorithm, and can be operated with either an independent reference signal or by using the delayed input signal as the reference. Tests made on a collection of 64 ultrasonic A-scans using the same processing parameters show that an up to 10 dB improvement in signal-to-noise ratio can typically be obtained. A cell-averaging constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector is used to detect the signals automatically. The performance of the method is compared to that of split spectrum processing, both with and without polarity thresholding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/6666/00265817.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"33","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.265817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.265817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=265817","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation of highly scattering materials using adaptive filtering and detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Adaptive signal detection","Signal detection","Adaptive filters","Materials testing","Grain boundaries","Least squares approximation","Delay","Signal to noise ratio","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic materials testing","ultrasonic scattering","adaptive filters","acoustic signal processing","signal detection","flaw detection","acoustic filters","grain boundaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation","highly scattering material","adaptive filtering","detection","ultrasonic echo signals","test targets","coherent scattering","grain boundaries","highly scattering materials","normalized least mean square error algorithm","reference signal","delayed input signal","ultrasonic A-scans","processing parameters","signal-to-noise ratio","cell-averaging constant false alarm rate","polarity thresholding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation of highly scattering materials using adaptive filtering and detection","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4645645","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation of highly scattering materials using adaptive filtering and detection","sourcePdf":"00265817.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046501S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"24","articleId":"265817","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":265818,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"lastName":"Hong Wang","id":"37384385600"},{"name":"E.S.

The degree of degradation depends on the severity of phase aberrations. As predicted by simulation and verified by experimental results, focal degradation scales with the circular variance of phase errors. However, degraded power deposition patterns can be significantly improved after phase aberration correction, especially where patterns are complicated and the aberrations are severe. Also, as shown in motion compensation experiments, an aberration corrected pattern can be particularly sensitive to aberrator movement greater than the correlation length of the aberrator. After motion compensation, new sharply focused patterns can be accomplished, thus reducing the unwanted influence of \"body\" movement by stabilizing the positions of foci with respect to patient anatomy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.265818","startPage":"34","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/6666/00265818.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.265818","endPage":"43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Phase aberration correction and motion compensation for ultrasonic hyperthermia phased arrays: experimental results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265818/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Phase aberration correction and motion compensation for ultrasonic hyperthermia phased arrays: experimental results","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4645646","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Phase aberration correction and motion compensation for ultrasonic hyperthermia phased arrays: experimental results","sourcePdf":"00265818.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064188S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"38","articleId":"265818","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":265821,"authors":[{"name":"W.M.

In some instances the speckle motion replicates the underlying tissue motion, in others it does not. The authors name \"speckle motion artifact\" the difference between the speckle and the underlying tissue motion. An echographic image formation model is used to study the motion artifact produced by a rotating phantom and observed by a linear scan imaging system with a Gaussian beam. The authors propose that when the tissue is modeled as a random array of small and numerous scatterers, such motion aberration be accounted for by the 2D phase characteristics of the imaging system. An analytic prediction of this motion artifact in relation to the imaging system characteristics (beam width, transducer frequency, pulse duration) is presented. It is shown that the artifact results from the curvature of the system point spread function, which in turn determines the curvature of the 2D phase characteristics. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time a comprehensive model of ultrasonic speckle motion artifact is presented. The model has been developed to study rotation-induced artifact; the method is however quite general and can be extended to study the effects of other tissue motion, in particular deformation and shear.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/58.265828","startPage":"105","endPage":"122","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.265828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6666","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/6666/00265828.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speckle motion artifact under tissue rotation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265828/","displayDocTitle":"Speckle motion artifact under tissue rotation","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4645655","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speckle motion artifact under tissue rotation","sourcePdf":"00265828.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040002S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6666","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"60","articleId":"265828","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":265883,"authors":[{"name":"K.D.

The observed higher conversion efficiency for wavelength down-conversion is believed to be caused by phase interferences that exist between various mechanisms contributing to the four-wave mixing process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265886/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646047","volume":"6","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficiency of broadband four-wave mixing wavelength conversion using semiconductor traveling-wave amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficiency of broadband four-wave mixing wavelength conversion using semiconductor traveling-wave amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00265886.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04376S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6669","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"111","articleId":"265886","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":265888,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The practical realizations of approximate Bessel-like amplitude distribution on the transducer surface are known. In this paper the vibrational characteristics of ultrasonic transducers consisting of a ceramic ring filled with a plastic disk were considered. Assuming that the amplitude on the surface of the plastic disk inside the ring is described by the Bessel function of zero order, the directivity characteristics of those transducers measured experimentally were presented. In the near zone the width of the measured main lobe is narrow, which is in accordance with the theoretical results for circular transducers with truncated Bessel function amplitude distribution. Changing the inner diameter of the ring, it is possible to control the resonance frequency of the filling plastic material. On the other hand, the resonance frequency of the ring may be regulated by varying its width, The existing coupling of resonant vibrations of the ceramic ring and plastic material enables variations of the bandwidth of the considered circular transducers. The Bessel transducers generate nondiffracting beams with a large depth of field. This is why the potential applications of Bessel transducers in robotics for object identification are worth noting.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4662208","volume":"9","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasonic transducers with Bessel function distribution of vibrational amplitude on their surfaces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasonic transducers with Bessel function distribution of vibrational amplitude on their surfaces","sourcePdf":"00265917.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031303S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"1","articleId":"265917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":265918,"authors":[{"name":"H.

However, the poor quality of velocity measurements may significantly deteriorate the control performance of these methods. In this paper the authors propose a design strategy that utilizes the passivity concept in order to develop combined controller-observer systems for robot motion control using position measurements only. To this end, first a desired energy function for the closed-loop system is introduced, and next the controller-observer combination is constructed such that the closed-loop system matches this energy function, whereas damping is included in the controller- observer system to assure asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. A key point in this design strategy is a fine tuning of the controller and observer structure to each other, which provides solutions to the output-feedback robot control problem that are conceptually simple and easily implementable in industrial robot applications. Experimental tests on a two-DOF manipulator system illustrate that the proposed controller-observer systems enable the achievement of higher performance levels compared to the frequently used practice of numerical position differentiation for obtaining a velocity estimate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.265918","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/6670/00265918.pdf","startPage":"740","endPage":"754","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.265918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A passivity approach to controller-observer design for robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"A passivity approach to controller-observer design for robots","volume":"9","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4662209","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A passivity approach to controller-observer design for robots","sourcePdf":"00265918.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040946S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"336","articleId":"265918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":265940,"authors":[{"name":"E.S.H.

This scheduling problem is known to be NP-hard, and methods based on heuristic search have been proposed to obtain optimal and suboptimal solutions. Genetic algorithms have recently received much attention as a class of robust stochastic search algorithms for various optimization problems. In this paper, an efficient method based on genetic algorithms is developed to solve the multiprocessor scheduling problem. The representation of the search node is based on the order of the tasks being executed in each individual processor. The genetic operator proposed is based on the precedence relations between the tasks in the task graph. Simulation results comparing the proposed genetic algorithm, the list scheduling algorithm, and the optimal schedule using random task graphs, and a robot inverse dynamics computational task graph are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.265940","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/6671/00265940.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.265940","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A genetic algorithm for multiprocessor scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265940/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1994","displayDocTitle":"A genetic algorithm for multiprocessor scheduling","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4646312","volume":"5","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 1994","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetic algorithm for multiprocessor scheduling","sourcePdf":"00265940.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029322S","chronDate":"Feb 1994","isNumber":"6671","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"449","articleId":"265940","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":265944,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Simulating this process on a computer results in stochastic optimization techniques that can often outperform classical methods of optimization when applied to difficult real-world problems. There are currently three main avenues of research in simulated evolution: genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, and evolutionary programming. Each method emphasizes a different facet of natural evolution. Genetic algorithms stress chromosomal operators. Evolution strategies emphasize behavioral changes at the level of the individual. Evolutionary programming stresses behavioral change at the level of the species. The development of each of these procedures over the past 35 years is described.

A hybrid optimization scheme is proposed that embeds a single-agent stochastic search technique, the method of Solis and Wets, into the evolutionary programming paradigm. The proposed hybrid optimization approach is further augmented by \"blending\" randomly selected parent vectors to create additional offspring. The first part of this work investigates the performance of the suggested hybrid stochastic search method. After demonstration on the Bohachevsky and Rosenbrock response surfaces, the hybrid stochastic optimization approach is applied in determining both the model order and the coefficients of recurrent perceptron time-series models. An information criterion is used to evaluate each recurrent perceptron structure as a candidate solution. It is speculated that the stochastic training method implemented in this study for training recurrent perceptrons can be used to train perceptron networks that have radically recurrent architectures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/6672/00265958.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"38","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.265958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.265958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=265958","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolving recurrent perceptrons for time-series modeling","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","IIR filters","Search methods","Genetic programming","Finite impulse response filter","Stochastic systems","Neural networks","Delay","Transversal filters","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","search problems","time series","optimisation","digital filters","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent perceptrons","time-series modeling","evolutionary programming","multi-agent stochastic search technique","nonlinear IIR filters","hybrid optimization","Bohachevsky and Rosenbrock response surfaces","information criterion","stochastic training method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Evolving recurrent perceptrons for time-series modeling","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646291","pubMedId":"18267777","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolving recurrent perceptrons for time-series modeling","sourcePdf":"00265958.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104926S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"95","articleId":"265958","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":265959,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Such a simplification is necessary since the interactions between network structure and function are not well understood. Evolutionary computations, which include genetic algorithms and evolutionary programming, are population-based search methods that have shown promise in many similarly complex tasks. This paper argues that genetic algorithms are inappropriate for network acquisition and describes an evolutionary program, called GNARL, that simultaneously acquires both the structure and weights for recurrent networks. GNARL's empirical acquisition method allows for the emergence of complex behaviors and topologies that are potentially excluded by the artificial architectural constraints imposed in standard network induction methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/6672/00265960.pdf","startPage":"54","endPage":"65","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/72.265960","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.265960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=265960","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An evolutionary algorithm that constructs recurrent neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Recurrent neural networks","Network topology","Computer architecture","Genetic algorithms","Genetic programming","Search methods","Induction generators","Ash","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural nets","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary algorithm","recurrent neural networks","genetic algorithms","evolutionary programming","population-based search methods","GNARL"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","displayDocTitle":"An evolutionary algorithm that constructs recurrent neural networks","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646293","pubMedId":"18267779","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An evolutionary algorithm that constructs recurrent neural networks","sourcePdf":"00265960.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042177S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"629","articleId":"265960","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":265963,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

Conventional algorithms break down in this regime due to a cascading of noise artifacts, and inconsistencies arising from the lack of optimal interaction between high- and low-level processing. These problems are addressed by solving low-level problems such as intensity estimation, segmentation, and boundary estimation jointly (synergistically) with intermediate-level problems such as the estimation of position, magnification, and orientation, and high-level problems such as object identification and scene interpretation. This is achieved by formulating a single objective function that incorporates all the data and object models, and a hierarchy of constraints in a Bayesian framework. All image-processing operations, including those that exploit the low and high-level variables to satisfy multi-level pattern constraints, result directly from a parallel multi-trajectory global optimization algorithm. Experiments with simulated low-count (7-9 photons/pixel) 2-D Poisson images demonstrate that compared to non-joint methods, a joint solution not only results in more reliable scene interpretation, but also a superior estimation of low-level imaging variables. Typically, most object parameters are estimated to within a 5% accuracy even with overlap and partial occlusion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.265963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/6672/00265963.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"95","doi":"10.1109/72.265963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint solution of low, intermediate, and high-level vision tasks by evolutionary optimization: Application to computer vision at low SNR","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Joint solution of low, intermediate, and high-level vision tasks by evolutionary optimization: Application to computer vision at low SNR","volume":"5","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646296","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18267782","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265963/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint solution of low, intermediate, and high-level vision tasks by evolutionary optimization: Application to computer vision at low SNR","sourcePdf":"00265963.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08431S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"12","articleId":"265963","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":265964,"authors":[{"name":"G.

For a given set of admissible quantizers used to code a discrete nonstationary signal sequence in a buffer-constrained environment, they formulate the optimal solution. They also develop slightly suboptimal but much faster approximations. These solutions are valid for any globally minimum distortion criterion, which is additive over the individual elements of the sequence. As a first step, they define the problem as one of constrained, discrete optimization and establish its equivalence to some of the problems studied in the field of integer programming. Forward dynamic programming using the Viterbi algorithm is shown to provide a way of computing the optimal solution. Then, they provide a heuristic algorithm based on Lagrangian optimization using an operational rate-distortion framework that, with computing complexity reduced by an order of magnitude, approaches the optimally achievable performance. The algorithms can serve as a benchmark for assessing the performance of buffer control strategies and are useful for applications such as multimedia workstation displays, video encoding for CD-ROMs, and buffered JPEG coding environments, where processing delay is not a concern but decoding buffer size has to be minimized.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal trellis-based buffered compression and fast approximations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.265978","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/6673/00265978.pdf","startPage":"26","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.265978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=265978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265978/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimal trellis-based buffered compression and fast approximations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646639","pubMedId":"18291907","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal trellis-based buffered compression and fast approximations","sourcePdf":"00265978.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055713S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"162","articleId":"265978","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":265979,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.

The solution of the new problem formulation is computed with an efficient multiscale algorithm. Experiments on several image sequences demonstrate the substantial computational savings that can be achieved due to the fact that the algorithm is noniterative and in fact has a per pixel computational complexity that is independent of image size. The new approach also has a number of other important advantages. Specifically, multiresolution flow field estimates are available, allowing great flexibility in dealing with the tradeoff between resolution and accuracy. Multiscale error covariance information is also available, which is of considerable use in assessing the accuracy of the estimates. In particular, these error statistics can be used as the basis for a rational procedure for determining the spatially-varying optimal reconstruction resolution. Furthermore, if there are compelling reasons to insist upon a standard smoothness constraint, the new algorithm provides an excellent initialization for the iterative algorithms associated with the smoothness constraint problem formulation. Finally, the usefulness of the approach should extend to a wide variety of ill-posed inverse problems in which variational techniques seeking a \"smooth\" solution are generally used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265979/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4646640","pubMedId":"18291908","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Efficient multiscale regularization with applications to the computation of optical flow","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient multiscale regularization with applications to the computation of optical flow","sourcePdf":"00265979.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080181S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"95","articleId":"265979","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":265980,"authors":[{"name":"C.

First, signal-adaptive maximum likelihood (SAML) filters are proposed for ultrasonic speckle removal. It is shown that in the case of displayed ultrasound (US) image data the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator of the original (noiseless) signal closely resembles the L/sub 2/ mean which has been proven earlier to be the ML estimator of the original signal in US B-mode data. Thus, the design of signal-adaptive L/sub 2/ mean filters is treated for US B-mode data and displayed US image data as well. Secondly, the segmentation of ultrasonic images using self-organizing neural networks (NN) is investigated. A modification of the learning vector quantizer (L/sub 2/ LVQ) is proposed in such a way that the weight vectors of the output neurons correspond to the L/sub 2/ mean instead of the sample arithmetic mean of the input observations. The convergence in the mean and in the mean square of the proposed L/sub 2/ LVQ NN are studied. L/sub 2/ LVQ is combined with signal-adaptive filtering in order to allow preservation of image edges and details as well as maximum speckle reduction in homogeneous regions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.265980","startPage":"65","endPage":"77","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.265980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6673","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/6673/00265980.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear ultrasonic image processing based on signal-adaptive filters and self-organizing neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/265980/","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear ultrasonic image processing based on signal-adaptive filters and self-organizing neural networks","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4646641","pubMedId":"18291909","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear ultrasonic image processing based on signal-adaptive filters and self-organizing neural networks","sourcePdf":"00265980.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088072S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"73","articleId":"265980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":266050,"authors":[{"name":"R.

An abstract formulation of service disciplines and pricing policies that allows the interplay between service disciplines and pricing policies in determining overall network performance to be described more clearly is presented. Effective multiclass service disciplines allow networks to focus resources on performance-sensitive applications, while effective pricing policies allows the benefits of multiple service classes to be spread around to all users. Furthermore, the incentives formed by service disciplines and pricing policies must be carefully tuned so that user self-interest leads to optimal overall network performance. These concepts are illustrated through simulation of several simple example networks.

Two-phase algorithms have been devised to assign and reassign spread-spectrum codes to transmitters, to receivers and to pairs of stations in a large dynamic packet radio network in polynomial times. The purpose of the code assignments is to spatially reuse spreading codes to reduce the possibility of packet collisions and to react dynamically to topological changes. These two-phase algorithms minimize the time complexity in the first phase and minimize the number of control packets needed to be exchanged in the second phase. Therefore, they can start the network operation in a short time, then switch to the second phase with the goal of adapting to topological changes. A pairwise code-assignment scheme is proposed to assign codes to edges. Simulations based on well-controlled topologies (sparse topologies) show that the scheme requires much fewer codes than transmitter-based code assignment, while maintaining similar throughput performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Packet radio networks","Network topology","Spread spectrum communication","Throughput","Access protocols","Interference","Switches","Time division multiple access","Frequency division multiaccess"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","codes","computational complexity","network topology","packet radio networks","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA packet radio networks","distributed code assignments","code-division multiple access","approximately orthogonal spread-spectrum waveforms","low cross-correlation spread-spectrum waveforms","two-phase algorithms","spread-spectrum codes","transmitters","receivers","polynomial times","code assignments","spreading codes","packet collisions","topological changes","time complexity","control packets","network operation","pairwise code-assignment scheme","sparse topologies","throughput performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266055","doi":"10.1109/90.266055","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/6674/00266055.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.266055","startPage":"668","endPage":"677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6674","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed code assignments for CDMA packet radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed code assignments for CDMA packet radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","volume":"1","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4657575","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed code assignments for CDMA packet radio networks","sourcePdf":"00266055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037507S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"142","articleId":"266055","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":266057,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Ring networks with spatial reuse can achieve significantly higher throughput than standard token rings but they also introduce the possibility of starvation for some nodes on the ring. To alleviate this problem, various policies have been suggested in the literature. The present objective is to characterize the node throughputs achievable by general transmission policies in ring networks with spatial reuse and then to evaluate the throughput trade-off for a class of policies that has been proposed in the literature in order to avoid starvation. Specifically, the authors study a policy that is based on the idea of allocating transmission quotas to the nodes. Each node is guaranteed transmission of his quota within a specified interval. The authors show that by appropriately allocating the quotas, policies that satisfy general optimality criteria-in particular criteria related to fairness-can be designed. They also study the asymptotic behavior of the quota policy when either the quotas or the number of nodes increase.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel4/90/6674/00266059.pdf","startPage":"718","endPage":"728","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/90.266059","doi":"10.1109/90.266059","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266059","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Intelligent networks","Local area networks","Proposals","Token networks","Communication networks","Bandwidth","Resource management","Wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["packet switching","scheduling","telecommunication traffic","token networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fair policies","ring network","slotted ring","spatial reuse","node throughputs","transmission policies","starvation","transmission quotas","optimality criteria","asymptotic behavior","quota policy","number of nodes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266059/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Throughput properties of fair policies in ring networks","accessionNumber":"4657579","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","volume":"1","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput properties of fair policies in ring networks","sourcePdf":"00266059.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030325S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"19","articleId":"266059","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":266137,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Their use has until very recently been confined into expensive high performance military applications. Recent advances in VLSI technology and modern DSP techniques have meant that adaptive beamforming techniques can be used in lower cost, commercial applications. The authors present a novel subband adaptive beamformer (SAB) that uses quadrature mirror filter (QMF) banks to generate the subbands. The initial results point out that the QMF-SAB could be more advantageous to use in terms of convergence speed and cancellation performance over fullband adaptive beamformers (FAB).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"3rd European Conference on Satellite Communications - ECSC-3, 1993.","pdfPath":"/iel3/1173/6675/00266137.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6675","publicationTitle":"3rd European Conference on Satellite Communications - ECSC-3, 1993.","startPage":"55","endPage":"59","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced beamforming techniques for broad-band satellite applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced beamforming techniques for broad-band satellite applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266137/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4578577","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-4 Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced beamforming techniques for broad-band satellite applications","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"00266137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045915S","chronDate":"2-4 Nov 1993","isNumber":"6675","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1173","citationCount":"2","articleId":"266137","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":266139,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Similar experiments were performed on a voiced/unvoiced speech classification task. ANN had a lower error rate than KNN or BGM for all training set sizes, although BGM approached the ANN error rate as the training set became larger.

The recognition accuracy was 99.3%, suggesting that the model can be effective for speech recognition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266355","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266355.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"32 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266355","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speaker-independent word recognition using dynamic programming neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266355/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Speaker-independent word recognition using dynamic programming neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3471951","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker-independent word recognition using dynamic programming neural networks","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038386S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"43","articleId":"266355","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":266356,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The spectrum dynamic features are also utilized. The algorithm is applied to hidden Markov models (HMMs) and neural networks and evaluated using a database of 216 phonetically balanced words and 5240 important Japanese words uttered by three speakers. The HMM speaker adapted recognition rate for /b,d,g/ is 79.5%. The average recognition rate for the top-three choices is about 91%.

The core of AUTOSEGM is a self-segmentation procedure: the speech material is segmented into pseudosyllables, within which some occurrences of the diphone-like segments are located.

The approach is based on representing the LPC all-pole filter as a cascade of two lower-order all-pole filters. The partitioning of the LPC polynomial is done in the root domain by clustering the roots into two distinct groups. The quantizer uses two codebooks to quantize each of the lower-order filters. However, the quantization process is done so as to optimize jointly the performances of the two subsystems. The likelihood-ratio distortion measure is used as a performance criterion in the design and coding processes. Splitting the LPC filter into two subsystems dramatically reduces the coding complexity while the efficiency of using vector quantization is essentially preserved. Experimental results show an average performance of 1.59, 1.41, 1.24, and 1.10 dB log-spectral distortion at the rates of 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 kb/s, respectively.

The first algorithm (2-D DCT), which requires relatively large coding delays, is based on two-dimensional (time and frequency) discrete cosine transform coding techniques; the second algorithm (DCT-DPCM), which does not need any coding delay, uses one-dimensional discrete cosine transform in the frequency domain and DPCM (differential pulse-code modulation) in the time domain. The performances of these systems for different bit rates and delays are studied, and appropriate comparisons are made. It is shown that an average spectral distortion of approximately 1 dB/sup 2/ can be achieved with 21 and 25 bits/frame using the 2-D DCT and DCT-DPCM schemes, respectively. This is a noticeable improvement over the previously reported bit rates of 32 bits/frame and above.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266390.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"171 vol.1","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266390","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient encoding of speech LSP parameters using the discrete cosine transformation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Discrete cosine transforms","Speech analysis","Linear predictive coding","Quantization","Delay effects","Transform coding","Bit rate","Speech coding","Image coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","speech analysis and processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech coding","line spectrum pair parameters","intraframe correlation","LSP parameters","discrete cosine transformation","interframe correlation","encoding algorithms","frequency domain","differential pulse-code modulation","time domain","average spectral distortion","2-D DCT","DCT-DPCM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Efficient encoding of speech LSP parameters using the discrete cosine transformation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463328","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient encoding of speech LSP parameters using the discrete cosine transformation","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030091S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"29","articleId":"266390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":266397,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The algorithm is based on the pitch-synchronous overlap-add (PSOLA) approach and is capable of good quality prosodic modifications of natural speech. The algorithm can be seen as a simplification of a previous algorithm combining the PSOLA approach and frequency-domain transformations. On the other hand, it appears as a generalization of previous time-domain methods that perform pitch synchronous cut-and-splice operations on the speech waveform. This algorithm is used in the CNET diphone synthesis multilingual system, actually supporting three languages: French, Italian, and German.

This method is easily applicable to vector-quantization-based speech recognition systems where each word is represented as multiple sequences of codebook entries. In the adaptation algorithm, either the codebook is modified for each new speaker or input speech spectra are adapted to the codebook, thereby using codebook sequences universally for all speakers. The important feature of this algorithm is that a set of spectra in training frames and the codebook entries are clustered hierarchically. Based on the deviation vectors between centroids of the training frame clusters and the corresponding codebook clusters, adaptation is performed hierarchically from small to large numbers of clusters. Results of recognition experiments indicate that the proposed adaptation method is highly effective.

The first task assesses the capability of a simple MLP to generate nonlinear decision surfaces that discriminate among six broad phonetic classes. The MLP performance is actually comparable to that obtained by a hierarchical polynomial classifier. The second task deals with the sequential nature of speech. As short words like SI/NO do not give relevant problems of time alignment, the effects of different parts of the signal are taken into account by means of hidden units. A 98% recognition rate is achieved. For the third task, digital recognition, where the length of the words has a large range variation, a nonlinear time alignment is used that is performed through trace segmentation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266428","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00266428.png","startPage":"314","endPage":"317 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266428.pdf","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of neural networks for speaker independent isolated word recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Speech recognition","Telephony","Polynomials","Feeds","Working environment noise","Hidden Markov models","Laboratories","Tellurium","Ear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","speech classification","neural networks","isolated word recognition","connectionist approach","multilayer perceptrons","broad phonetic classes","speaker-independent recognition","isolated digits","telephone line","nonlinear decision surfaces","nonlinear time alignment","trace segmentation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"On the use of neural networks for speaker independent isolated word recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","accessionNumber":"3471992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of neural networks for speaker independent isolated word recognition","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046183S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"6","articleId":"266428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":266438,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The approach is based upon statistical modeling of the clean speech signal and the noise process using long training sequences from the two processes. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) with mixtures of Gaussian autoregressive (AR) output probability distributions are used to model the clean speech signal. A low-order Gaussian AR model is used for the wideband Gaussian noise considered here. The parameter set of the HMM is estimated using the Baum or the EM (estimation-maximization) algorithm. The enhancement of the noisy speech is done by means of reestimation of the clean speech waveform using the EM algorithm. An approximate improvement of 4.0-6.0 dB in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is achieved at 10 dB input SNR.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266438","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266438.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266438","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","startPage":"353","endPage":"356 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech enhancement based upon hidden Markov modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Speech enhancement based upon hidden Markov modeling","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266438/","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463339","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech enhancement based upon hidden Markov modeling","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266438.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036653S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"8","articleId":"266438","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":266439,"authors":[{"name":"C.

It is shown that the conventional approach of maximizing likelihood is easily implemented but does not work well in practice, as it tends to give improved models of tokens for which the initial model was generally quite good, but does not improve tokens which are poorly represented by the initial model. The authors have developed a splitting procedure which initializes each new cluster (statistical model) by splitting off all tokens in the training set which were poorly represented by the current set of models. This procedure is highly efficient and gives excellent recognition performance in connected-word tasks. In particular, for speaker-independent connected-digit recognition, using two HMM-clustered models, the recognition performance is as good as or better than previous results using 4-6 models/digit obtained from template-based clustering.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266451.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"408 vol.1","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HMM clustering for connected word recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Vocabulary","Training data","Parameter estimation","Databases","Clustering methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","HMM clustering","connected word recognition","hidden Markov model","large-vocabulary recognition","phonelike units","tokens","splitting procedure","training set","speaker-independent connected-digit recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"HMM clustering for connected word recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3472007","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HMM clustering for connected word recognition","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266451.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038195S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"40","articleId":"266451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":266453,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The author focuses on speech recognition, but also mentions some progress in other areas of speech processing (speaker recognition, speech synthesis, speech analysis and coding) using similar methodologies. The problems related to automatic speech processing are identified, and the initial approaches that have been followed in order to address those problems are described. The author then introduces the methodological novelties that allowed for progress along three axes: from isolated-word recognition to continuous speech, from speaker-dependent recognition to speaker-independent, and from small vocabularies to large vocabularies. Special emphasis centers on the improvements made possible by Markov models and, more recently, by connectionist models, resulting in improved performance for difficult vocabularies or in more robust systems. Some specialized hardware is described, as are efforts aimed at assessing speech-recognition systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266457.pdf","startPage":"429","endPage":"440 vol.1","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent advances in speech processing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech processing","Speech recognition","Vocabulary","Speech synthesis","Speech analysis","Speech coding","Humans","Speaker recognition","Automatic speech recognition","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","reviews","speech analysis and processing","speech recognition","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker independent recognition","small vocabulary recognition","large vocabulary recognition","speech processing","overview","speech recognition","speaker recognition","speech synthesis","speech analysis","coding","isolated-word recognition","continuous speech","speaker-dependent recognition","Markov models","connectionist models"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Recent advances in speech processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3472013","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent advances in speech processing","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266457.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125215S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"13","articleId":"266457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":266458,"authors":[{"name":"S.E.

The recognition system combines features from their current isolated-word recognition system and from their previously developed continuous-speech recognition system. It consists of an acoustic processor, an acoustic channel model, a language model, and a linguistic decoder. Some new features in the recognizer relative to the isolated-word speech recognition system include the use of a fast match to prune rapidly to a manageable number the candidates considered by the detailed match, multiple pronunciations of all function words, and modeling of interphone coarticulatory behavior. The authors recorded training and test data from a set of ten male talkers. The perplexity of the test sentences was found to be 93; none of sentences was part of the data used to generate the language model.

A state-space formulation of the prediction filter provides the connection between the standard fixed pole/adaptive zero models and the transversal filter model of the auditory system. Two realizations of the prediction filter are described: a parallel realization, which directly uses the auditory models, and a cascade realization, which allows direct manipulation of the poles and zeros of the filter.

The previous method uses a transformation matrix to modify the hidden Markov model (HMM) parameters of a prechosen prototype speaker to model a target speaker. To estimate the transformation matrix, it aligns a set of target speech with the same set of speech uttered by the prototype speaker using dynamic time warping. The authors focus on improving the previous method in the modeling of the spectral differences between two speakers, and the accuracy of the alignment. To improve the modeling of the spectral differences, they implemented a phoneme-dependent mapping procedure which transforms the prototype HMMs to the estimated target HMMs using a set of phoneme-dependent matrices. To improve the alignment, the authors developed a modeling of the silence, a linear duration normalization, and an iterative normalization procedure. They tested the new methods in the standard DARPA database with a grammar of perplexity 60. The performance shows a 30% word-error reduction compared to the previous algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266501.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"615 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative normalization for speaker-adaptive training in continuous speech recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266501","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Iterative normalization for speaker-adaptive training in continuous speech recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3472042","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative normalization for speaker-adaptive training in continuous speech recognition","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266501.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025572S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"10","articleId":"266501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":266505,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

However, in a large class of statistical problems, such as those arising in speech recognition based on hidden Markov models, it was found that estimation of parameters via some other criteria that use conditional likelihood, mutual information, or the recently introduced H-criteria can give better results than maximum-likelihood estimation. These problems require finding maxima for rational functions over domains of probability values, and an analog of the Baum-Eagon inequality for rational functions makes it possible to use an E-M (expectation-maximization) algorithm for maximizing these functions.

The semicontinuous output probability density function is represented by a combination of the discrete output probabilities of the model and the continuous Gaussian density functions of a mixture Gaussian density codebook. The amount of training data required, as well as the computational complexity of the semicontinuous HMM, can be reduced in comparison to the continuous-mixture HMM. Parameters of the codebook and HMM can be mutually optimized to achieve an optimal model/codebook combination, which leads to a unified modeling approach to vector quantization and hidden Markov modeling of speech signals.

Results show that a significant computational reduction is feasible without impairing the overall accuracy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266513/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3472054","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fast look-ahead pruning strategies in continuous speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast look-ahead pruning strategies in continuous speech recognition","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266513.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033898S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"4","articleId":"266513","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":266514,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The classification accuracy is shown to be significantly improved by using time duration constraints in formant feature space, especially for the formant mel-frequency representation and its time derivative. The highest vowel recognition accuracy is obtained by integrating the two feature spaces, multiplying the probabilities computed in the separate feature spaces. This improvement of vowel recognition is extended to the more general phoneme recognition task by use of a hierarchical feature integration method, which utilizes the vowel recognition results in formant feature space together with consonant recognition based on the LPC-based cepstral feature space.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266514.pdf","startPage":"663","endPage":"666 vol.1","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266514","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical phoneme discrimination by hidden Markov modelling using cepstrum and formant information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Cepstrum","Speech recognition","Cepstral analysis","Speech analysis","Speech processing","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Vector quantization","Decoding","Lifting equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","encoding","filtering and prediction theory","Markov processes","spectral analysis","speech analysis and processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cepstrum information","LPC cepstral vectors","hierarchical phoneme discrimination","hidden Markov modelling","formant information","vowel classification","linear predictive coding","formant features","classification accuracy","time duration constraints","vowel recognition accuracy","phoneme recognition","hierarchical feature integration method","consonant recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266514/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical phoneme discrimination by hidden Markov modelling using cepstrum and formant information","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3472055","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical phoneme discrimination by hidden Markov modelling using cepstrum and formant information","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030016S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"2","articleId":"266514","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":266515,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

This is a two-pass algorithm: the first pass makes local decisions on the direction of potential optimal paths, and the second generates a globally optimal path from the local information. This study eliminates the necessity for a second pass by associating separate objects, representing the history of the recognition, with each recognition score. As a result, it is possible to impose an arbitrary syntax direction mechanism on the recognition by examining these history objects at each frame of the recognized speech and predicting possible recognition paths. This technique presents a natural arrangement for implementing speech recognizers on parallel computing architectures. A demonstration recognizer using a push-down automation to implement a context-free grammar on a transputer network is described.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266515","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266515.pdf","startPage":"667","endPage":"670 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A unified syntax direction mechanism for automatic speech recognition systems using hidden Markov models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266515/","displayDocTitle":"A unified syntax direction mechanism for automatic speech recognition systems using hidden Markov models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3472056","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified syntax direction mechanism for automatic speech recognition systems using hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266515.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040503S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"1","articleId":"266515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":266517,"authors":[{"name":"B.J.

A method is devised that uses the differences in spectral slope between linear predictive coding log magnitude spectra to weight the point-by-point energy differences between the spectra. The distances of all reference tokens of like phonemes are combined to form a smallest cumulative distance (SCD) method. When SCD is combined with the method of slope-dependent weighting (SDW), the most significant success is obtained. In terms of error rates for a fixed phoneme vector length of five, SDW+SCD is found to reduce the difference in error rate between normal and abnormal speech by approximately 50%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266517.pdf","startPage":"675","endPage":"678 vol.1","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust recognition of loud and Lombard speech in the fighter cockpit environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Speech recognition","Speech enhancement","Testing","Stress","1f noise","Ear","Speech analysis","Linear predictive coding","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","loud speech","Lombard speech","fighter cockpit environment","recognition performance","abnormal speech","reference templates","normal speech","spectral slope","linear predictive coding","log magnitude spectra","energy differences","smallest cumulative distance","slope-dependent weighting","error rates","phoneme vector length"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266517/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Robust recognition of loud and Lombard speech in the fighter cockpit environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3472058","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust recognition of loud and Lombard speech in the fighter cockpit environment","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266517.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053432S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"15","articleId":"266517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":266523,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As an added benefit, the chart parsing algorithm allows parallel processing of lower level hypotheses autonomously with no fundamental algorithm changes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266529.pdf","startPage":"723","endPage":"726 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech recognition in a unification grammar framework","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266529","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266529/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Speech recognition in a unification grammar framework","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463366","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech recognition in a unification grammar framework","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113429S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"6","articleId":"266529","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":266530,"authors":[{"name":"Y.-L.

To maximize speech understanding performance, the constraints of the linguistic models must be used in the search for the most likely interpretation of the spoken message. The basic approach is to perform parsing (as in natural language processing) on the word lattice input produced by a lattice engine. The authors present two lattice parsing algorithms that determine a list (ordered by acoustic likelihood) of word sequences allowed by the grammar and present in the lattice. They describe how semantic constraints can be applied a posteriori to find the most likely interpretation of the input speech. They give speech understanding results on the standard DARPA resource management speech database.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech understanding using a unification grammar","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266530","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266530.pdf","startPage":"727","endPage":"730 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266530/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Speech understanding using a unification grammar","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463367","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech understanding using a unification grammar","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266530.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044917S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"8","articleId":"266530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":266544,"authors":[{"name":"R.

It is shown that the largest bottleneck in such a system is located in the memory access. The architecture exploits a variety of techniques, such as partitioning and replication, to cope with this memory bottleneck. The required throughput is achieved with the aid of extensive pipelining (up to thirteen levels deep) and concurrency. The architecture allows extension to larger vocabularies by the addition of more parallel units. Pin count considerations have resulted in the definition of five custom integrated circuits which are currently being tested. Using the proposed approach, the authors are currently designing and debugging a real-time 3000-word continuous-speech recognition system that uses bigram language models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266546.pdf","startPage":"789","endPage":"792 vol.2","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266546","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266546","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A large-vocabulary real-time continuous-speech recognition system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Hidden Markov models","Circuit testing","Partitioning algorithms","Throughput","Pipeline processing","Concurrent computing","Vocabulary","Application specific integrated circuits","Integrated circuit testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipeline processing","real-time systems","speech recognition","voice equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-vocabulary real-time continuous-speech recognition system","system architecture","hidden Markov model","bigram language models","memory access","pipelining","custom integrated circuits"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266546/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"A large-vocabulary real-time continuous-speech recognition system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463383","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A large-vocabulary real-time continuous-speech recognition system","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266546.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052959S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"10","articleId":"266546","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":266548,"authors":[{"name":"N.T.

Two practical systems are described to illustrate the way in which transputer arrays can be configured to concentrate computing power where it is most needed. The approach allows rapid algorithm development and testing in the Occam high-level language. Strong compiler type checking and run-time error checking engender a high level of confidence in the system performance. Real-time response is available by matching the number of processors to the complexity of the task, thus, for example, allowing the perceived performance of the recognizer/dialogue combination to be assessed for specific applications. The availability of flexible processing power limited only by cost allows many ideas to be investigated within a practical time scale.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266548.pdf","startPage":"797","endPage":"800 vol.2","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A transputer based speech recognition system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Prototypes","Throughput","Parallel processing","System testing","Feature extraction","Telecommunication computing","Delay effects","Application software","Natural languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech recognition","transputers","voice equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transputer based speech recognition system","prototyping environment","arrays","computing power","algorithm development","Occam","error checking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"A transputer based speech recognition system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3463385","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A transputer based speech recognition system","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074236S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"1","articleId":"266548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":266549,"authors":[{"name":"B.I.

The convergence properties of the algorithms are discussed, and the algorithms are applied to an underwater experiment in a constant-time context. Several cases of fluctuating underwater data transmission are simulated by varying the typical multipath parameters: magnitude ratio of the paths, delays, phases and SNR (signal/noise ratio). The simulation results clearly indicate that the SNR is of a great importance in the tracking capability of an equalizer. For a low SNR, (5 dB, for example), an optimal FLS (fast least squares) algorithm is useless for tracking magnitude ratio or path phase variations. For a high SNR (>20 dB), a FLS algorithm can perform better for compensating fast magnitude variations. In the phase fluctuation case, the algorithms performed equally well.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266642","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266642.pdf","startPage":"1171","endPage":"1174 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive equalization for underwater data transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266642/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive equalization for underwater data transmission","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3472137","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive equalization for underwater data transmission","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266642.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061606S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"6","articleId":"266642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":266645,"authors":[{"name":"G.J.

It is concluded that the multilayer perceptron offers advantages over the linear transversal equalizer in a number of areas. Its ability to form decision regions with nonlinear boundaries enables it to equalize both minimum-phase and non-minimum-phase channels without the introduction of any timing delay, a capability that may be of value in nonstationary environments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayer perceptron structures applied to adaptive equalisers for data communications","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266645","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266645.pdf","startPage":"1183","endPage":"1186 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266645","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Multilayer perceptron structures applied to adaptive equalisers for data communications","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3472140","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayer perceptron structures applied to adaptive equalisers for data communications","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266645.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022778S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"77","articleId":"266645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":266646,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The roundoff error of the SSGR is as stable as the roundoff error of any available square-root-free Givens rotation, and its deviation factor is better.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An orthogonal method for solving systems of linear equations without square roots and with few divisions","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266674","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266674.pdf","startPage":"1298","endPage":"1301 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266674","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"An orthogonal method for solving systems of linear equations without square roots and with few divisions","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3472162","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An orthogonal method for solving systems of linear equations without square roots and with few divisions","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266674.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05554S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"10","articleId":"266674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":266680,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The first technique uses two microphones and gives very good results in the case of one noise source. If two noise sources are situated at the same side of the head, there is also noise suppression, although less effective than with only one noise source. In the second technique the author creates notches in the directivity pattern of the filter when two uncorrelated noise sources are situated at opposite sides of the head by introducing an adaptive noise canceler using three microphones. The techniques were evaluated in real time using a specially developed board plugged into a personal computer.

The method consists of a two-step procedure whereby tentative estimates of both the desired and interfering signals are made and then converted into final estimates by detecting and correcting errors. The tentative decisions are formed using a structure consisting of a primary demodulator followed by a secondary demodulator incorporating an adaptive interference canceller. Errors in the tentative decisions are detected using an adaptive channel estimator and then corrected using a maximum-likelihood sequence estimator. Signature curves quantifying the symbol error rate of the tentative demodulator as a function of signal-to-noise ratio and signal-to-interference ratio are presented. A simulation of the error detection/correction method is also presented.

Lawton (IEEE Trans. Acoust., Speech, and Signal Process, vol.36, p.933-971, June 1988). This processing scheme assumes that Fourier transform samples of the projections obtained lie on a concentric-squares polar grid. The spatial-domain image is produced through a series of convolutions and DFTs (discrete Fourier transforms), all performed using FFTs (fast Fourier transforms). The algorithm requires O(N/sup 2/logN) operations to produce an N*N image and is made possible by the geometry of the concentric-squares polar grid. The present authors more completely describe the Lawton algorithm and derive a closed-form, approximate expression for its impulse response for the case of spotlight-mode synthetic aperture radar. A formula is given for the exact number of multiplications required by the algorithm, and a set of simulated point target responses is given to help assess the image quality provided by the algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266713.pdf","startPage":"1453","endPage":"1455 vol.3","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266713","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and simulation of a new algorithm for spotlight-mode synthetic aperture radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and simulation of a new algorithm for spotlight-mode synthetic aperture radar","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3485267","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and simulation of a new algorithm for spotlight-mode synthetic aperture radar","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266713.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024863S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"2","articleId":"266713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":266726,"authors":[{"name":"R. de Beer","affiliation":["Applied Physics Department, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"R.","lastName":"de Beer","id":"37376693600"},{"name":"D. van Ormondt","affiliation":["Applied Physics Department, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"D.","lastName":"van Ormondt","id":"37327453000"},{"name":"W.W.F.

The main objective of progressive transmission is to allow the receiver to recognize a picture as quickly as possible at minimum cost. After this it can be decided to receive further picture details or to abort the transmission. SBC turns out to be very suitable for such a system, because the low-pass version of the image is easily recognized for any image type. Further details of the picture are obtained by sequentially receiving the (encoded) higher bandpass versions of the image. Because SBC has good data compression properties, not many bits are needed to transmit the low-pass image and the other subbands. Comparisons to other progressive transmission schemes, such as 8*8 block DCT (discrete cosine transform) encoding, show that SBC is favorable, both in mean-squared error and in a subjective sense.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00266803.png","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266803.pdf","startPage":"1811","endPage":"1814 vol.3","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Progressive transmission of images using subband coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Image recognition","Discrete cosine transforms","Data compression","Pixel","Image reconstruction","Information theory","Costs","Bandwidth","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","encoding","picture processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image transmission","image coding","subband coding","progressive transmission of images","picture","data compression"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Progressive transmission of images using subband coding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3485327","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Progressive transmission of images using subband coding","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266803.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034543S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"16","articleId":"266803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":266806,"authors":[{"name":"Haibo Li","affiliation":["Division of LSP.

The interframe predictor is motion-adaptive, using a pel-recursive method to estimate the displacement vector. A weight coefficient is adapted continuously in order to favor the prediction mode that performs better. For the sequence examined a significant improvement is obtained in comparison with either mode alone. A crucial problem in predictive coding, particularly with adaptive techniques, is that of sensitivity to transmission errors. A method ensuring the autoadjustment of the decoder in the presence of isolated transmission errors is proposed for the intraframe mode.

This scheme avoids the use of scalar quantization of DC coefficients in the transform domain and yet substantially reduces the blocking effect that tends to arise at low bit rates. Good reconstructed images have been obtained at rates between 0.3 and 0.4 bits/pixel, depending on the nature of the test images. The technique also permits progressive image transmission and reproduces errorless images with compression of about 5.0 bits/pixel. Experimental results indicate that an efficient bit allocation in the coding process produces a substantial improvement in performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266823","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266823.pdf","startPage":"1890","endPage":"1893 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classified transform coding of images using vector quantization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266823/","displayDocTitle":"Classified transform coding of images using vector quantization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3485347","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classified transform coding of images using vector quantization","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266823.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03786S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"32","articleId":"266823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":266837,"authors":[{"name":"R.J.

The noise-level target is used to set the quantization levels in a DPCM (differential pulse code modulation) quantizer. The output from the DPCM quantizer is then encoded, using an entropy-based coding scheme, in either 1*1, 1*2, or 2*2 pixel blocks. The type of encoding depends on the statistics in each 4*4 subblock of a particular subband. One set of codebooks, consisting of less than 100000 entries, is used for all images, and the codebook subset used for any given image is dependent on the distribution of the quantizer outputs for that image. A block elimination algorithm takes advantage of the peaky spatial energy distribution of subbands to avoid using bits for quiescent parts of a given subband. Using this system, high-quality output is obtainable at bit rates from 0.1 to 0.9 bits/pixel, and nearly transparent quality requires 0.3 to 1.5 bits/pixel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266837.pdf","startPage":"1945","endPage":"1948 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A perceptually tuned sub-band image coder with image dependent quantization and post-quantization data compression","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266837","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00266837.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266837","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"A perceptually tuned sub-band image coder with image dependent quantization and post-quantization data compression","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3496744","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A perceptually tuned sub-band image coder with image dependent quantization and post-quantization data compression","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266837.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039077S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"136","articleId":"266837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":266849,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

The stereo ECPTC exploits both the redundancy in the stereo signal and the effects of acoustic mixing in the listening environment in order to encode the stereo signal at a bit rate much less than twice that for a monophonic signal. This coder uses the perceptual threshold developed by the author (IEEE J. Selected Areas in Commun. vol.6, no.2, p.314-23, Feb. 1988) along with a noiseless compression scheme to provide a bit-rate reduction of approximately one third compared to that for two independent monophonic channels. Typical rates available from the coder are 64 kb/s for a 6.6-kHz bandwidth, 14-kHz sampling rate transparent monophonic channel, 128 kb/s for a 15-kHz bandwidth, 32-kHz sampling rate stereo channel with FM or better quality, and 192 kb/s for a 20-kHz bandwidth, 44.1-kHz sampling rate stereo channel with perceived quality equal to that of the original signal. The 64-kb/s, 128-kb/s, and 192-kb/s rates correspond to ISDN (integrated services digital network) 1B, 2B, and 3B rates respectively, suggesting applications within the ISDN framework.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266849","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00266849.png","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266849.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266849","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","startPage":"1993","endPage":"1996 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perceptual transform coding of wideband stereo signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266849","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","displayDocTitle":"Perceptual transform coding of wideband stereo signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266849/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3485353","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perceptual transform coding of wideband stereo signals","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266849.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031692S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"21","articleId":"266849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":266851,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Tamura author and A. Waibel (Int. Conf. Acoust., Speech and Signal Proc., p.553-6, 1988) is described. Each layer has 60 units and is fully interconnected with the next higher layer. The input of the network is given by a 60-point-long (at 12-kHz sampling rate) noisy waveform, and the output is a 60-point-long noise-free waveform. The network was trained using the back-propagation learning algorithm. The network is divided into three subelements for the analysis. Each element stands for a transformation from a layer output to the next higher layer output. First, the transformation from the input layer to the first hidden layer is analyzed, showing that the linear part of the transformation performs linear noise reduction as well as linear speech/noise-characteristic extraction. It is also shown that the transformation from the first hidden layer to the second hidden layer greatly compresses the noise region of the first hidden layer by sigmoid nonlinearities, while preserving its speech region, and the transformation from the second hidden layer to the output layer linearly suppresses the noise components. The spectra of basis vectors spanning an output waveform space show poor higher formant structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266851","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266851.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","startPage":"2001","endPage":"2004 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of a noise reduction neural network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of a noise reduction neural network","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266851/","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3485354","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of a noise reduction neural network","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266851.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029229S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"35","articleId":"266851","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":266855,"authors":[{"name":"D.K.

It is concluded that the use of Prony's method to model musical sounds is efficient when applied to highly damped signals: its very good frequency resolution makes it possible to use small analysis windows and to follow efficiently the evolution of each sinusoidal component. The algorithm proposed for computing amplitudes avoids the problems due to biases in damping factor estimation.

This implies that implementations such as square foot free Givens rotations should not be considered in an application-specific integrated circuit or similar design due to their potential instability and susceptibility to overflow.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266952/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","publicationDate":"1989","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"3485453","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Arithmetic implementation of the Givens QR triarray","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arithmetic implementation of the Givens QR triarray","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266952.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038844S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"4","articleId":"266952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":266954,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

Although by necessity more restrictive than a general-purpose ASIC design system, this tool is able to support the rapid specification and verification of dedicated DSP processors of arbitrary throughput, accuracy, and functional complexity. The tool maps applications on to a generic pipelined numerical processing architecture, which is flexible enough in its use of innate parallelism to meet a wide range of throughput requirements with minimal waste of resources. An intelligent defaults system provides further leverage by accepting incomplete specifications and filling in the blanks. The architectural approach is illustrated by a 2-D video-rate discrete cosine transform case study.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266954","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266954.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266954","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","startPage":"2413","endPage":"2416 vol.4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generic ASIC architecture and synthesis scheme for DSP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266954","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generic ASIC architecture and synthesis scheme for DSP","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266954/","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3485455","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generic ASIC architecture and synthesis scheme for DSP","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266954.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065912S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","articleId":"266954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":266955,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

The architecture maps the mean/quantized residual vector quantizer (MQRVQ), an extension of mean/residual VQ, onto a VLSI/LSI chip set. The MQRVQ contributes to the feasibility of the VLSI architecture through the use of a simple multiplication-free distortion measure and reduction of the required memory per codevector. In other words, the complexity-reduced MQRVQ allows each subcodebook of 128 codevectors (10 kb) and its associated encoding elements to be fitted onto a VLSI chip. This architecture reduces encoding search complexity through partitioning of a large codebook into on-chip memories of a concurrent VLSI chip set. There are 64 of these VLSI chips to accommodate a codebook with size up to 2/sup 13/=8192 codevectors.

Some schemes for mapping from a multilayer NN to a parallel digital processor topology are discussed. For a mesh topology there exists an optimal point where the computation count is minimum. In order to allow for applications such as a speaker-independent speech recognizer, the authors extend this mesh architecture to operate on sequential or, specifically, spatio-temporal inputs. A pipelining scheme is thus revealed, making it possible to improve the processing throughput. An extension of the processing element structure is obtained by introducing dynamic neurons and a consequent pipelining architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266977/","accessionNumber":"3485473","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of processor topologies for a fast trainable neural network for speech recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of processor topologies for a fast trainable neural network for speech recognition","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266977.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043627S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"2","articleId":"266977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":266978,"authors":[{"name":"E. di Zitti","affiliation":["Department of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"E.","lastName":"di Zitti","id":"37622973400"},{"name":"D.D.

Such a circuit can be used to reduce the redundancy of a full-motion video source for applications where low- or very-low-bit-rate coding is required. The chip architecture is motivated by the consideration that the ME equations can be solved with a recursive approach, pel by pel, with a simple serial design. The system structure is partitioned into three stages: the first stage implements the pseudogradient generator, the second is the recursive displacement generator, and the third is a shared memory array. The ME design was achieved by means of commercial tools, in particular a macrocell generator and a parameterized high-level behavioural description. The circuit layout was synthesized by using custom cells, whereas glue logic was made with a standard cells approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266993","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00266993.pdf","startPage":"2573","endPage":"2576 vol.4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.266993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI implementation of a pel-by-pel motion estimator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=266993","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/266993/","displayDocTitle":"VLSI implementation of a pel-by-pel motion estimator","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1989","accessionNumber":"3485483","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI implementation of a pel-by-pel motion estimator","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00266993.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054562S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"1","articleId":"266993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":266997,"authors":[{"name":"D.N.

When they compared it to the minimum-variance distortionless-response beamformer (MVDR-BF), they concluded that it is especially suited for correlated returns. This improvement is at the cost of some frequency distortion in wideband applications. To circumvent this problem, the minimum-mean-square-error distortionless-response beamformer (MMSEDR-BF) is introduced. Its behavior is compared with the MVDR-BF and the MMSE-BF. Adaptive beamforming is discussed as an inverse problem. Within this framework, the authors suggest the use of alternative norms, e.g. the L/sub 1/ norm.

The resulting estimator structure is then modified to reduce the computational requirements substantially.

An outline is presented of a GA for maximizing a Gaussian likelihood function, and it is shown that it can outperform existing high-performance parameter estimation algorithms under difficult conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.267029","startPage":"2716","endPage":"2719 vol.4","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.267029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00267029.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithms for maximum likelihood parameter estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/267029/","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithms for maximum likelihood parameter estimation","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"3496771","publicationDate":"1989","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"23-26 May 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithms for maximum likelihood parameter estimation","confLoc":"Glasgow, UK","sourcePdf":"00267029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033111S","chronDate":"23-26 May 1989","isNumber":"6677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"805","citationCount":"34","articleId":"267029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":267035,"authors":[{"name":"Ju-Hong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ju-Hong Lee","id":"37280309400"},{"name":"Jen-Fu Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jen-Fu Wu","id":"37383979200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1520-6149"}],"articleNumber":"267035","dbTime":"57 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":68},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Array signal processing","Adaptive arrays","Phased arrays","Signal to noise ratio","Geometry","Jamming","Vectors","Antenna arrays","Iterative algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna array","robust technique","adaptive array beamforming","steering vector error","maximum output SNR","signal phase vector","single-look direction constraint"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach for robust adaptive beamforming","doi":"10.1109/ICASSP.1989.267035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6677","endPage":"2743 vol.4","publicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","displayPublicationTitle":"International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing,","pdfPath":"/iel2/805/6677/00267035.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICASSP.1989.267035","startPage":"2740","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=267035","abstract":"A robust technique for adaptive array beamforming in the presence of steering vector error is proposed. It is based on the fact that an optimized steered-beam adaptive beamformer possesses the maximum output SNR when the steering vector coincides with the signal phase vector. The steering vector is adjusted iteratively to meet the actual signal phase vector. The resulting beamformer provides optimum performance in the sense of satisfying the single-look direction constraint without any tradeoff between the array performance and robustness. Thus the difficulties of using conventional algorithms can be overcome.

Many numerical simulations have assessed the rapid convergence of the method as well as its stability with respect to both absolute and relative errors in the data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.267349","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6682/00267349.pdf","startPage":"1501","endPage":"1508","doi":"10.1109/8.267349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpolation of electromagnetic radiated fields over a plane by nonuniform samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Interpolation of electromagnetic radiated fields over a plane by nonuniform samples","volume":"41","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4627370","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/267349/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolation of electromagnetic radiated fields over a plane by nonuniform samples","sourcePdf":"00267349.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034412S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"34","articleId":"267349","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":267353,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan-Min Lee","affiliation":["Surface Systems, Hughes Aircraft Company, Fullerton, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Kuan-Min Lee","id":"37351733900"},{"name":"Ruey-Shi Chu","affiliation":["Surface Systems, Hughes Aircraft Company, Fullerton, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ruey-Shi Chu","id":"37339344000"},{"name":"Sien-Chang Liu","affiliation":["Surface Systems, Hughes Aircraft Company, Fullerton, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Sien-Chang Liu","id":"37384405600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"267353","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":675},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Calibration","System testing","Apertures","Signal detection","Phase measurement","Phase detection","Signal processing","Condition monitoring","Performance evaluation","Radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active antennas","antenna phased arrays","antenna testing","measurement systems","radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active phased-array antennas","performance monitoring system","fault isolation system","fault correction system","PM/FIC system","transmission line signal injector","radiating aperture","phase-toggling technique","signal detection","active elements","dual-channel transmit/receive modules","column array","far-field range tests","fault correction tests","test array","measurement accuracy","HP8510 measurement system","radar antennas"]}],"abstract":"A built-in performance-monitoring/fault isolation and correction (PM/FIC) system for an active phased-array antenna has been developed and tested.

The basic idea of the technique is to form a quadratic program with its cost function given by the mean-square error between the array response and a properly selected pattern described by a known mathematical function. This quadratic program can be a constrained or unconstrained optimization problem depending on the requirements of the desired array pattern. In formulating the quadratic program, no assumption has been made on the gain/phase response or characteristics of the individual array elements. Therefore, one can synthesize an array of arbitrary shape to any appropriate pattern with the characteristic of the array elements taken into consideration as long as one is able to model the array accurately. The proposed method is used to synthesize arrays of different shapes, linear as well as planar arrays (including rectangular and circular planar arrays), using a Chebyshev polynomial or zero function as a design template, to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/267354/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","volume":"41","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"4627375","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A flexible array synthesis method using quadratic programming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A flexible array synthesis method using quadratic programming","sourcePdf":"00267354.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038834S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"58","articleId":"267354","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":267356,"authors":[{"name":"R.

High-frequency techniques can adequately model the cavity, but perform poorly when applied to the termination. Low-frequency techniques are currently infeasible for such large geometries because of the large memory and computation time requirements. The authors present a hybrid method which combines the most attractive features of the lowand high-frequency techniques. The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is applied to the small region surrounding the termination. The remainder of the cavity is modeled with ray methods. To validate this method, they consider two-dimensional cavities with complex terminations. Their results are compared against those found from a hybrid combination of the modal method and the method of moments.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6682/00267356.pdf","startPage":"1560","endPage":"1569","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.267356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.267356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6682","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=267356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of electromagnetic scattering from a cavity with a complex termination by means of a hybrid ray-FDTD method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic analysis","Electromagnetic scattering","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Radar scattering","Moment methods","Jet engines","Geometry","Computational efficiency","Electromagnetic modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace engines","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite difference time-domain analysis","radar cross-sections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic scattering","hybrid ray-FDTD method","electromagnetic modeling","engine cavities","electrical size","engine termination","high-frequency techniques","low-frequency techniques","finite-difference time-domain","ray methods","two-dimensional cavities","complex termination","modal method","method of moments","radar cross sections"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/267356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of electromagnetic scattering from a cavity with a complex termination by means of a hybrid ray-FDTD method","volume":"41","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4627377","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of electromagnetic scattering from a cavity with a complex termination by means of a hybrid ray-FDTD method","sourcePdf":"00267356.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044349S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6682","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"50","articleId":"267356","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":267359,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Hwang Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuan-Hwang Chen","id":"37351429300"},{"name":"Ching-Tai Chiang","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Tai Chiang","id":"37277664300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"267359","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":606},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Kalman filters","Convergence","Adaptive arrays","Covariance matrix","Interference","Distortion measurement","Equations","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing","convergence of numerical methods","digital filters","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive beamforming","constrained Kalman filter","adaptive array","constrained least mean square algorithm","constrained Kalman algorithm","signal distortion","look direction","array response","measurement equation","weight vector","constrained Kalman beamformer","minimum variance distortionless response beamformer","convergence rate","sidelobe canceller","one-step Kalman predictor","simulation results"]}],"abstract":"From the viewpoint of achieving rapid convergence, application of a Kalman filter to an adaptive array is considered. Compared with the Frost's (1972) constrained least-mean-square algorithm, the constrained Kalman algorithm for adaptive beamforming is proposed to overcome the problem of signal distortion along the look direction which occurs in the unconstrained Kalman beamformer of Baird (1974). A constraint on the array response along the look direction is added to the measurement equation of the Kalman filter. The weight vector of the constrained Kalman beamformer is derived and shown to converge to that of the minimum-variance distortionless-response beamformer.

With the symmetrical properties of kernel matrices, one can greatly reduce the number of multiplications. With carefully grouping the DCT coefficients, the computational complexity can be further reduced, for example, if the 2D-DCT coefficients are coded and transmitted according to the zig-zag scanning. The proposed fast 2D-IDCT algorithm which takes the advantage of zero-valued DCT elements is suitable for high throughput HDTV receiving systems. The DCT is generally recognized as the best way to encode digital picture information, because it results in virtually the same energy compact performance as the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT). The DCT has the advantage of lower computational complexity than the KLT.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast two-dimensional inverse discrete cosine transform for HDTV or videophone systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.267420","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/30/6684/00267420.pdf","startPage":"934","endPage":"940","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.267420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6684","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=267420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/267420/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Fast two-dimensional inverse discrete cosine transform for HDTV or videophone systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4627580","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast two-dimensional inverse discrete cosine transform for HDTV or videophone systems","sourcePdf":"00267420.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036792S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"6","articleId":"267420","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":267444,"authors":[{"name":"V.S.

The spectral method is the best currently known technique to prove lower bounds on the expansion. He improves this technique by showing that the expansion coefficient of linear-sized subsets of a k-regular graph G is at least k/2(1- square root max(0,1-/sub lambda 1(G)2//sup 4k-4/))/sup -/ , where lambda /sub 1/(G) is the second largest eigenvalue of the graph. In particular, the linear expansion of Ramanujan graphs, which have the property that the second largest eigenvalue is at most 2 square root k-1, is at least (k/2)/sup -/. This improves upon the best previously known lower bound of 3(k-2)/8. For any integer k such that k-1 is prime, he explicitly constructs an infinite family of k-regular graphs G/sub n/ on n vertices whose linear expansion is k/2 and such that lambda /sub 1/(G/sub n/)<or= square root k-1+0(1). Since the graphs G/sub n/ have asymptotically optimal second eigenvalue, this essentially shows the (k/2) is the best bound one can obtain using the second eigenvalue method.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1992.267762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1992.267762","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., 33rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., 33rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel2/424/6693/00267762.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the second eigenvalue and linear expansion of regular graphs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 1992","displayDocTitle":"On the second eigenvalue and linear expansion of regular graphs","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4483022","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/267762/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the second eigenvalue and linear expansion of regular graphs","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00267762.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048225S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"424","citationCount":"8","articleId":"267762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":267766,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In view of the likelihood of errors occurring in a lengthy interaction, it is desirable to incorporate this possibility in the model of communication. The author relates the noisy channel and the standard (noise less channel) complexities of a communication problem by establishing a 'two-way' or interactive analogue of Shanon's coding theorem: every noiseless channel protocol can be simulated by a private-coin noisy channel protocol whose time bound is proportional to the original (noiseless) time bound and inversely proportional to the capacity of the channel, while the protocol errs with vanishing probability. The method involves simulating the original protocol while implementing a hierarchical system of progress checks which ensure that errors of any magnitude in the simulation are, with high probability, rapidly eliminated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Codes","Protocols","Distributed computing","Parallel processing","Automata","Concurrent computing","Communication standards","Channel capacity","Capacity planning","Hierarchical systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","distributed algorithms","encoding","errors","information theory","noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noisy channels","coding theorem","computation","distributed computing","parallel computing","errors","noisy channel","complexities","noiseless channel protocol","private-coin noisy channel protocol"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SFCS.1992.267778","publicationTitle":"Proceedings., 33rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings., 33rd Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","pdfPath":"/iel2/424/6693/00267778.pdf","startPage":"724","endPage":"733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1992.267778","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication on noisy channels: a coding theorem for computation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=267778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Communication on noisy channels: a coding theorem for computation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/267778/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4498953","conferenceDate":"24-27 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Oct 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication on noisy channels: a coding theorem for computation","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"00267778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033415S","chronDate":"24-27 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6693","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"424","citationCount":"46","articleId":"267778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":267823,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Simulations demonstrated the promising performance of the proposed algorithm for the blind equalization of a three-ray multipath channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] SUPERCOMM/ICC '92 Discovering a New World of Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/642/6695/00267989.pdf","startPage":"1513","endPage":"1517 vol.3","publicationTitle":"[Conference Record] SUPERCOMM/ICC '92 Discovering a New World of Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1992.267989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1992.267989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6695","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=267989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind identification and equalization of multipath channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Multipath channels","Adaptive equalizers","Signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Finite impulse response filter","Communication standards","Timing","Statistics","Information filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","identification","statistical analysis","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency domain approach","3-ray channels","multipath channels","fractionally spaced blind identification and equalization method","blind equalization","second-order statistical information","nonminimum phase channel","cyclostationarities"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/267989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Blind identification and equalization of multipath channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4498596","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind identification and equalization of multipath channels","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00267989.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038247S","chronDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","isNumber":"6695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"642","citationCount":"33","articleId":"267989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":267990,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

The problem is addressed in a blind setting, i.e., only the channel output is observed, not the input to it. The proposed recursive parameter estimator is globally convergent, i.e., the parameter estimator converges to the true model regardless of its initialization. Therefore, the blind equalizer designed based upon the estimated channel parameters is also globally convergent. The proposed parameter estimator is based upon a two model decomposition approach: a SEMP (spectrally equivalent minimum phase) system in cascade with an allpass system. The author exploits the fourth-order cumulant statistics, in addition to the usual second-order statistics, of the data. A computer simulation example is also presented using a 4-PAM (pulse amplitude modulation) signal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1992.267990","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6695","startPage":"1508","endPage":"1512 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] SUPERCOMM/ICC '92 Discovering a New World of Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/642/6695/00267990.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A globally convergent adaptive blind equalizer based on second and fourth order statistics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/267990/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"A globally convergent adaptive blind equalizer based on second and fourth order statistics","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4498595","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A globally convergent adaptive blind equalizer based on second and fourth order statistics","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00267990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050055S","chronDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","isNumber":"6695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"642","citationCount":"6","articleId":"267990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":267992,"authors":[{"name":"P.

When simulating networks of queues, regenerative techniques must be used to make the application of IS feasible and efficient. The application of regenerative techniques is also crucial in obtaining correct confidence intervals for the estimates involved. The authors present a methodology that uses IS dynamically, within each regeneration cycle, to drive the system back to the regeneration state, after an accurate estimate has been obtained. They also extend a technique developed earlier for finding near-optimal biasing parameters for link simulations to discrete-event simulations of queuing systems. The combination of these techniques was demonstrated by estimating blocking probabilities for the M/M/1/K, M/D/1/K, and GI/D/1/K queues. Improvement factors of thirteen to fourteen orders of magnitude were obtained for these examples.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4493295","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A dynamic importance sampling methodology for the efficient estimation of rare event probabilities in regenerative simulations of queueing systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dynamic importance sampling methodology for the efficient estimation of rare event probabilities in regenerative simulations of queueing systems","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00268032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030961S","chronDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","isNumber":"6695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"642","citationCount":"4","articleId":"268032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":268036,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The new DD algorithm, the soft decision-directed equalization algorithm, is most effective for reconstructing binary phase shift keying and quadrature phase shift keying signals. The new DD blind equalizer can converge in closed eye situations. In the simulations, the performance of the soft DD algorithm was illustrated by applying it to a two-dimensional digital mobile communications system. A time-varying multipath fading channel model was used as the transmission medium. The performance of the soft DD blind equalization algorithm is compared to that of the standard DD algorithm, the maximum-level-error (MLE) algorithm, and the fast recursive least squares decision-feedback equalization (FRLS-DFE) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate the improvement in performance achievable with the proposed soft DD equalization algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1992.268036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6695","startPage":"1272","endPage":"1276 vol.3","pdfPath":"/iel2/642/6695/00268036.pdf","publicationTitle":"[Conference Record] SUPERCOMM/ICC '92 Discovering a New World of Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] SUPERCOMM/ICC '92 Discovering a New World of Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1992.268036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A soft decision-directed blind equalization algorithm applied to equalization of mobile communication channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Decision feedback equalizers","Signal processing algorithms","Adaptive equalizers","Mobile communication","Binary phase shift keying","Quadrature phase shift keying","Equations","Error correction","Quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital radio systems","equalisers","fading","feedback","mobile radio systems","neural nets","phase shift keying","signal synthesis","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal reconstruction","maximum level error algorithm","blind equalization algorithm","mobile communication channels","neural network classification","soft decision-directed equalization algorithm","binary phase shift keying","quadrature phase shift keying","digital mobile communications system","time-varying multipath fading","channel model","fast recursive least squares","simulation results"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"A soft decision-directed blind equalization algorithm applied to equalization of mobile communication channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268036/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4493291","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A soft decision-directed blind equalization algorithm applied to equalization of mobile communication channels","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00268036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076802S","chronDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","isNumber":"6695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"642","citationCount":"20","articleId":"268036","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":268037,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The author presents an alternative approach, in which the source encodes its signal hierarchically, and the network delivers subsets of the signal layers in accordance with individual destinations' bandwidth constraints. This approach allows each user to trade off reception bandwidth for signal quality independently of other users' selections. In support of such a service, efficient routes that carry the desired bandwidth to all destinations must be computed.

The resulting noise-predictive PR equalizer consists of a forward linear PR equalizer followed by a linear predictor to whiten the noise and the residual distortion at the equalizer output. Assuming correct decisions and applying results from prediction theory, it is shown that the minimum mean-square error of a noise-predictive PR equalizer equals that of a decision-feedback equalizer which employs no PR shaping. This result shows that the performance of a receiver with a PR shaping equalizer can always be improved by attaching a noise-whitening predictor. Simulation results are presented for channels typically encountered in wire transmission and magnetic recording, i.e., channels with a spectral null at DC and strong high-frequency attenuation.

The authors investigate the various system components necessary to realize such a system on a single integrated circuit. They discuss the modulation format, adaptive equalization and its convergence, and system sensitivity to sampling phase error. A comparison of conventional quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) schemes is presented. It is concluded that a QAM-based system can meet the system objectives. The use of fractionally spaced equalization and error prediction as means of improving SNR and reducing the hardware complexity is investigated for such a system. It is shown that with 6 T/2-spaced feedforward equalizer taps, eight decision-feedback equalizer taps, and two error predictor taps, the proposed digital QAM system can achieve performance close to that of an ideal infinite-length equalizer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of a QAM adaptive receiver for 1.6 Mbps digital subscriber line transmission","publicationTitle":"[Conference Record] SUPERCOMM/ICC '92 Discovering a New World of Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1992.268074","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] SUPERCOMM/ICC '92 Discovering a New World of Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/642/6695/00268074.pdf","startPage":"937","endPage":"941 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1992.268074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6695","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=268074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268074/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of a QAM adaptive receiver for 1.6 Mbps digital subscriber line transmission","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4493253","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of a QAM adaptive receiver for 1.6 Mbps digital subscriber line transmission","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00268074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076064S","chronDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","isNumber":"6695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"642","citationCount":"6","articleId":"268074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":268082,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Using a novel Erlang-B approximation method, together with simulation, they demonstrate that even the simplest algorithm, the timid, compares favorably with impractical, centrally administered fixed channel allocation. The results suggest that an aggressive algorithm, that is, one requiring call reconfigurations, could provide substantially reduced blocking. Practical algorithms are presented that take major steps toward achieving the excellent performance of the best aggressive algorithm but that have the stability of the timid algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268125/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4487698","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Call blocking performance of distributed algorithms for dynamic channel allocation in microcells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Call blocking performance of distributed algorithms for dynamic channel allocation in microcells","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00268125.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037656S","chronDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","isNumber":"6695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"642","citationCount":"37","articleId":"268125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":268132,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The optimal output power of O-FDM systems and the network size limitation of O-FDM local networks are clarified. It is shown that a splitting ratio of 2000 could be realized even with 200 O-FDM channels per fiber, given the existing optical fibers and EDFAs. The usable number of optical frequencies is mainly restricted by FWM generated in the fiber between the optical multiplier and the EDFA, as well as EDFA output power saturation characteristics.

With this wide bandwidth, fading due to multipath propagation is minimized, since the bandwidth is much wider than the coherence bandwidth of the fade. Link loss measurements were taken between a B-CDMA transmitter and a mobile user, located at various indoor and outdoor points throughout the region of interest. Using these data, loci of constant link loss were plotted on a regional map.

A scheme to overcome this problem is presented on the common control channels. A configuration of control channels is considered and a comparison is made between two schemes where (a) both forward and return control channels are individually assigned to each beam, and (b) return channels are commonly assigned to all beams and forward channels are individually assigned to each beam. An inter beam diversity technique involving an individual unique word detection and combining method is proposed and analyzed for return control channels.

The proposed system can reduce the influence of state-of-polarization (SOP) fluctuations on the receiver sensitivity by using multiplying detection with in-phase and quadrature optical signal components of two orthogonal polarizations. The proposed system is insensitive to phase noise and is attractive for high speed transmission since the receiver is of the homodyne type. The most attractive features of the proposed system are that neither a polarization controller nor an electronic feedback loop for matching the SOPs is needed and that two problems, polarization state and phase noise, are solved. The authors theoretically analyze the receiver sensitivity considering the influence due to the elliptical SOP of received optical signals and the power penalty of the proposed system in the case of the unbalanced optical 90 degrees hybrid.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1992.268185","publicationTitle":"[Conference Record] SUPERCOMM/ICC '92 Discovering a New World of Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] SUPERCOMM/ICC '92 Discovering a New World of Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/642/6695/00268185.pdf","startPage":"743","endPage":"747 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1992.268185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarization state and phase noise insensitive POLSK phase-diversity homodyne system in coherent optical communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=268185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268185/","displayDocTitle":"Polarization state and phase noise insensitive POLSK phase-diversity homodyne system in coherent optical communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4487638","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization state and phase noise insensitive POLSK phase-diversity homodyne system in coherent optical communications","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00268185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047916S","chronDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","isNumber":"6695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"642","citationCount":"1","articleId":"268185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":268197,"authors":[{"name":"S.A.

The results are useful for the exact computation of the total interference and error probabilities in some CDMA systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] SUPERCOMM/ICC '92 Discovering a New World of Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/642/6695/00268202.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"656 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Conference Record] SUPERCOMM/ICC '92 Discovering a New World of Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1992.268202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1992.268202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6695","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=268202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation of exact interference and probability of error for several CDMA communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Multiaccess communication","Frequency","Communication systems","Random variables","Probability distribution","Optical receivers","Density functional theory","Gaussian approximation","Radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","codes","frequency agility","probability","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Welch-Costas codes","interference probability","error probability","cyclical hit arrays","frequency-hop patterns","quadratic congruence codes","exact probability distribution function","random variable","code division multiple access","CDMA systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","displayDocTitle":"Computation of exact interference and probability of error for several CDMA communication systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4487621","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation of exact interference and probability of error for several CDMA communication systems","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00268202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028001S","chronDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","isNumber":"6695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"642","citationCount":"2","articleId":"268202","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":268225,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

The authors study the degradation of DEQPSK for different fading rates and operating bit error rates (BERs). Frequency-reuse systems and power-limited systems are studied. It is shown that the degradation of DEQPSK in fading channels is not as high as in linear static channels. However, for any practical fading rate and operating BER, the degradation is as high as 2 dB. It is also shown that the degradation is independent of the fading rate. For the practical operating BER, the degradation is also constant. Thus, an unambiguous phase estimation scheme should be used in fading channels if coherent detection is essential. Unambiguous phase estimation can be achieved by utilizing the preamble sequence or inserting pilot symbols. It is also shown that the power efficiency is also improved by 2 dB when truly coherent demodulation is employed in a power-limited system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICC.1992.268241","publicationTitle":"[Conference Record] SUPERCOMM/ICC '92 Discovering a New World of Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"[Conference Record] SUPERCOMM/ICC '92 Discovering a New World of Communications","pdfPath":"/iel2/642/6695/00268241.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC.1992.268241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6695","startPage":"316","endPage":"318 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proposed pi /4-CQPSK with increased capacity in digital cellular systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=268241","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Proposed pi /4-CQPSK with increased capacity in digital cellular systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268241/","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4487582","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposed pi /4-CQPSK with increased capacity in digital cellular systems","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00268241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049616S","chronDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","isNumber":"6695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"642","citationCount":"1","articleId":"268241","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":268242,"authors":[{"name":"T.

To use this band most effectively it should also be shared by several competitive broadband code division multiple access (CDMA) personal communication network (PCN) systems. It is demonstrated how two or more competitive systems can share the spectrum without interfering with each other, without significantly decreasing the chip rate (and hence the bandwidth) of each PCN system, and without increasing the level of interference seen by the fixed service microwave user. This is extremely important since the wider the bandwidth the more immune is the PCN system to fading due to multipath propagation. It is shown that by staggering the frequencies, a significant increase in the number of services results with only a small decrease in performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","conferenceDate":"14-18 June 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4487568","displayDocTitle":"Improved PCN efficiency through the use of spectral overlay","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved PCN efficiency through the use of spectral overlay","confLoc":"Chicago, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00268255.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033601S","chronDate":"14-18 Jun 1992","isNumber":"6695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"642","citationCount":"7","articleId":"268255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":268256,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The piezoelectric transformer, made of lead titanate solid solution ceramic, is operated with a thickness extensional vibration mode. This transformer can operate at high frequency, over several megahertz, with about 90% efficiency. The resonant frequency for the transformer is 2 MHz. The power converter with the transformer applies the theory for a class-E switching converter using an electromagnetic transformer. Maximum output power is obtained when the switching frequency is slightly higher than the resonant frequency. A 4.4 W output power is successfully obtained with 52% efficiency at 2.1 MHz switching frequency.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268407/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-8 Oct 1992","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4487825","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":" 1992","displayDocTitle":"2 MHz power converter with piezoelectric ceramic transformer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2 MHz power converter with piezoelectric ceramic transformer","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"00268407.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07565S","chronDate":"4-8 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6696","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"678","citationCount":"44","articleId":"268407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":268424,"authors":[{"name":"K.

A drawback of training with jitter, in comparison with the unjittered case, is that many more sample presentations are required in order to average over the noise and estimate the expected response. The authors demonstrate that the expected effect of jitter can be computed, in certain cases, by a simple scaling of the sigmoid nonlinearities. This means that the benefits of training with noise can be obtained without the computational cost of averaging over many noisy samples. These results provide justification for gain scaling as a heuristic for improving generalization. Application of this technique to a single-hidden-layer perceptron with linear output is considered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/RNNS.1992.268603","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 RNNS/IEEE Symposium on Neuroinformatics and Neurocomputers","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings] 1992 RNNS/IEEE Symposium on Neuroinformatics and Neurocomputers","pdfPath":"/iel2/680/6697/00268603.pdf","startPage":"120","endPage":"127 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RNNS.1992.268603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An equivalence between sigmoidal gain scaling and training with noisy (jittered) input data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=268603","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268603/","displayDocTitle":"An equivalence between sigmoidal gain scaling and training with noisy (jittered) input data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4493800","conferenceDate":" 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An equivalence between sigmoidal gain scaling and training with noisy (jittered) input data","confLoc":"Rostov on Don, Russia","sourcePdf":"00268603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052815S","chronDate":"7-10 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"680","citationCount":"5","articleId":"268603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":268605,"authors":[{"name":"V.I.

Furthermore, the modulation index can only be changed once per cycle, thus reducing the dynamic response of the system. This paper proposes a technique of generating gating patterns online for CSI topologies based on carrier PWM techniques (PWM rectifiers or inverters). The proposed technique is designed and implemented for the standard three-phase six-switch configuration. It delivers the appropriate gating signals for all switching patterns and modulation indices including overmodulation. It is therefore possible to extend the concept of duality in the power circuit topology between VSI's and CSI's to carrier PWM modulation techniques. In the proposed approach, the requirements imposed on gating signals are satisfied by the appropriate combinations of single phase switching patterns and the introduction of the required complementary and overlap pulses. Implementation in a mixed analog/digital circuit is described and experimental results obtained on a 2 kVA voltage-controlled current source inverter unit are given.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"ISIE '93 - Budapest: IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics Conference Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel2/697/6698/00268723.pdf","startPage":"674","endPage":"678","publicationTitle":"ISIE '93 - Budapest: IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics Conference Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ISIE.1993.268723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIE.1993.268723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6698","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=268723","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line generation of gating signals for current source converter topologies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal generators","Pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation inverters","Circuit topology","Switches","Rectifiers","Current control","Switching circuits","DC generators","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital control","dynamic response","invertors","mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","power convertors","pulse width modulation","rectifiers","switching circuits","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CSI","complementary pulses","gating signals","PWM rectifiers","current source inverters","modulation index","dynamic response","online","three-phase","switching patterns","overmodulation","duality","power circuit topology","single phase","overlap pulses","mixed analog/digital circuit","2 kVA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268723/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"On-line generation of gating signals for current source converter topologies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4577320","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-3 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line generation of gating signals for current source converter topologies","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"00268723.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105324S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"697","citationCount":"35","articleId":"268723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":268763,"authors":[{"name":"M.P.

As a result, disk system performance is fast becoming a dominant factor in overall svstem behavior. Naturally, researchers want to improve overall I/O performance, of which a large component is the performance of the disk drive itself. This research often involves using analytical or simulation models to compare alternative approaches, and the quality of these models determines the quality of the conclusions: indeed, the wrong modeling assumptions can lead to erroneous conclusions. Nevertheless, little work has been done to develop or describe accurate disk drive models. This may explain the commonplace use of simple, relatively inaccurate models. We believe there is much room for improvement. This article demonstrates and describes a calibrated, high-quality disk drive model in which the overall error factor is 14 times smaller than that of a simple first-order model. We describe the various disk drive performance components separately, then show how their inclusion improves the simulation model. This enables an informed trade-off between effort and accuracy. In addition, we provide detailed characteristics for two disk drives, as well as a brief description of a simulation environment that uses the disk drive model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2.268881","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00268881.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.268881","startPage":"17","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/6700/00268881.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An introduction to disk drive modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268881/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","displayDocTitle":"An introduction to disk drive modeling","volume":"27","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4673954","publicationDate":"March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An introduction to disk drive modeling","sourcePdf":"00268881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03938S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"438","articleId":"268881","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":268884,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this article, we examine the use of caching as a means to increase system response time and improve the data throughput of the disk subsystem. Caching can help to alleviate I/O subsystem bottlenecks caused by mechanical latencies. This article describes a caching strategy that offers the performance of caches twice its size. After explaining some basic caching issues, we examine some popular caching strategies and cache replacement algorithms, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of caching at different levels of the computer system hierarchy. Finally, we investigate the performance of three cache replacement algorithms: random replacement (RR), least recently used (LRU), and a frequency-based variation of LRU known as segmented LRU (SLRU).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268884/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","publicationDate":"March 1994","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4673956","volume":"27","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Caching strategies to improve disk system performance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Caching strategies to improve disk system performance","sourcePdf":"00268884.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079404S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"150","articleId":"268884","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":268888,"authors":[{"name":"A.L.

Multimedia computing requires us to focus on designing I/O systems that can handle real-time demands. Video- and audio-stream playback and teleconferencing are real-time applications with different I/O demands. We primarily consider playback applications which require guaranteed real-time I/O throughput. In a multimedia server, different service phases of a real-time request are disk, small computer systems interface (SCSI) bus, and processor scheduling. Additional service might be needed if the request must be satisfied across a local area network. We restrict ourselves to the support provided at the server, with special emphasis on two service phases: disk scheduling and SCSI bus contention. When requests have to be satisfied within deadlines, traditional real-time systems use scheduling algorithms such as earliest deadline first (EDF) and least slack time first. However, EDF makes the assumption that disks are preemptable, and the seek-time overheads of its strict real-time scheduling result in poor disk utilization. We can provide the constant data rate necessary for real-time requests in various ways that require trade-offs. We analyze how trade-offs that involve buffer space affect the performance of scheduling policies. We also show that deferred deadlines, which increase buffer requirements, improve system performance significantly.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/6700/00268888.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"74","doi":"10.1109/2.268888","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.268888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6700","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"I/O issues in a multimedia system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268888/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","displayDocTitle":"I/O issues in a multimedia system","publicationDate":"March 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4673959","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"I/O issues in a multimedia system","sourcePdf":"00268888.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037001S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6700","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"156","articleId":"268888","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":268921,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The observation of some very simple, but fundamental, principles of measurement can have an extremely beneficial effect on the subject. Measurement theory is used to highlight both weaknesses and strengths of software metrics work, including work on metrics validation. We identify a problem with the well-known Weyuker properties (E.J. Weyuker, 1988), but also show that a criticism of these properties by J.C. Cherniavsky and C.H. Smith (1991) is invalid. We show that the search for general software complexity measures is doomed to failure. However, the theory does help us to define and validate measures of specific complexity attributes. Above all, we are able to view software measurement in a very wide perspective, rationalising and relating its many diverse activities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.268921","startPage":"199","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/6701/00268921.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.268921","endPage":"206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software measurement: a necessary scientific basis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268921/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1994","displayDocTitle":"Software measurement: a necessary scientific basis","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4674701","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software measurement: a necessary scientific basis","sourcePdf":"00268921.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051249S","chronDate":"Mar 1994","isNumber":"6701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"271","articleId":"268921","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":268955,"authors":[{"name":"O.I.

The framework has two unique features: it distinguishes between goals and means by separating what you are trying to achieve in conceptual modeling from how to achieve it (it has been made so that the goals are more realistic by introducing the notion of feasibility); and it is closely linked to linguistic concepts because modeling is essentially making statements in some language.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/268955/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1994","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1994","volume":"11","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1994","accessionNumber":"4679136","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Understanding quality in conceptual modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding quality in conceptual modeling","sourcePdf":"00268955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044709S","chronDate":"March  1994","isNumber":"6703","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"52","citationCount":"447","articleId":"268955","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":269029,"authors":[{"name":"J.

An important feature of the net is that it can be used as an error-correcting associative memory if the thresholds of the hard-logic-neurons in the first layer are properly adjusted.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/269035/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4634590","volume":"40","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Bipolar pattern association using a two-layer feedforward neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bipolar pattern association using a two-layer feedforward neural network","sourcePdf":"00269035.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037246S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"2","articleId":"269035","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":269037,"authors":[{"name":"G.P.

A great deal of work has been done showing how to break this bottleneck using look-ahead computation. By applying results of P. Kogge and H. Stone (IEEE Trans. Comput., vol. C-22, pp. 786-793, 1973) it was shown that few basic algebraic axioms are sufficient for speeding up recursions by look-ahead techniques. This allows one to generalize architectures derived for special cases. Furthermore, it was shown that the look-ahead computation technique, known to date only for recursions with up to two operations, can be generalized to recursions with n operations. This allows the design of massively parallel architectures for more complex recursions. General algebraic examinations of expressions as described here can be applied to feedforward expressions, as well.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/81.269037","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel4/81/6705/00269037.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/81.269037","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Fundamental Theory and Applications","startPage":"949","endPage":"952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic recurrence transformations for massive parallelism","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=269037","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Algebraic recurrence transformations for massive parallelism","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/269037/","volume":"40","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4634592","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic recurrence transformations for massive parallelism","sourcePdf":"00269037.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040482S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"81","citationCount":"1","articleId":"269037","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":269049,"authors":[{"name":"D.

It is shown through analysis and simulation that the proposed read channel is suitable for user densities of 1.5 to 2.0 and higher, for reasonable SNR and error rates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Conference Record of the Twenty-Sixth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/445/6707/00269079.pdf","startPage":"956","endPage":"960 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[1992] Conference Record of the Twenty-Sixth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1992.269079","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1992.269079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=269079","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An advanced read/write channel for magnetic disk storage","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic recording","Transfer functions","Magnetic heads","Magnetic memory","Disk recording","Logic","Space technology","Magnetic modulators","Modulation coding","Partial response signaling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","magnetic disc storage","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["read/write channel","magnetic disk storage","(1,7) run-length limited code","partial response equalization","Viterbi detection","nonlinear effects","thin film disk recording","user densities","SNR","error rates"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/269079/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"An advanced read/write channel for magnetic disk storage","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4613466","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An advanced read/write channel for magnetic disk storage","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00269079.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029651S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"445","citationCount":"21","articleId":"269079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":269100,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

Because of the non-Gaussian nature of the problem and the nonlinearities in the motion model, it is difficult to make inclusive generalizations about the relative performance. It is evident though that an imager may help to achieve good quiescent performance without a severe tuning penalty. This exchange is difficult to make with conventional algorithms. Two modified linear Gauss Markov procedures are shown to have similar performance, and in this application, increasing the order of the estimator to shape the ersatz Gaussian disturbance is not worth the additional complexity.

The first approach extracts invariant features from texture images; moment invariant features and log-polar filter features are employed. The second approach follows a mental transformation procedure similar to the process of scaled and rotated shape recognition carried out by human beings. Texture images are rotated and scaled to a specific size and orientation which allows the application of a more general rotation-scale sensitive classification scheme. A two-stage estimation procedure is introduced to determine the required scaling and rotation factors. Simulations show that the mental transformation approaches outperformed the other approaches, giving a good averaged error rate of 10%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Conference Record of the Twenty-Sixth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","pdfPath":"/iel2/445/6707/00269229.pdf","startPage":"461","endPage":"465 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[1992] Conference Record of the Twenty-Sixth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems & Computers","doi":"10.1109/ACSSC.1992.269229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACSSC.1992.269229","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6707","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=269229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scale and rotation invariant texture classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humans","Shape","Feature extraction","Image recognition","Error analysis","Surface texture","Image texture analysis","Filters","Image analysis","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image texture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scale invariant texture classification","scaled shape recognition","feature extraction","rotation invariant texture classification","texture images","moment invariant features","log-polar filter features","mental transformation procedure","rotated shape recognition","two-stage estimation procedure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/269229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Scale and rotation invariant texture classification","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4602605","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scale and rotation invariant texture classification","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00269229.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059494S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"445","citationCount":"24","articleId":"269229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":269233,"authors":[{"name":"J.-N.

The overall algorithm is an approximation to the symbol-by-symbol detector of K. Abend and B. Fritchman (1970), in which the likelihoods are computed using extended Kalman filter (EKF) innovations. The EKF provides, in addition to the likelihoods, joint estimates of the signal delays and amplitudes. The resulting algorithm is quite complex, due to the large number of possible composite symbols corresponding to the multiple users. However, it is shown that the likelihood computation and EKF updates can be expressed in terms of a set of cross-correlation functions, which need only be computed for a subset of the possible symbols. Thus, the algorithm may be practical for certain narrowband applications using programmable DSP device implementations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/269248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Oct 1992","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4602586","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A symbol-by-symbol multiuser detector with joint amplitude and delay estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A symbol-by-symbol multiuser detector with joint amplitude and delay estimation","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00269248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051373S","chronDate":"26-28 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"445","citationCount":"1","articleId":"269248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":269269,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The goal is to select as small a subset of the transform coefficients as possible which contain the most information about the signal, without introducing objectionable error after reconstruction. With a sampling rate of 1 kHz, more than 99% of the power in the DCT is contained within the first 20% of the coefficients. Despite this result a 5:1 compression ratio cannot be obtained by merely substituting zero for the remaining 80%. The coefficients after the first 20%, although of relatively small magnitude, preserve the DC integrity of the signal. Approximating these components as zero leads to introduction of spurious sinusoidal terms in the reconstructed signal. A quantization technique to better approximate the higher coefficients has been used to obtain an accurate representation of the signal. The tradeoffs between accuracy, speed, and compression ratio are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CIC.1992.269340","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Computers in Cardiology","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Computers in Cardiology","pdfPath":"/iel2/456/6708/00269340.pdf","startPage":"687","endPage":"690","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00269340.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.1992.269340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ECG data compression using the discrete cosine transform (DCT)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=269340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/269340/","displayDocTitle":"ECG data compression using the discrete cosine transform (DCT)","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4595854","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ECG data compression using the discrete cosine transform (DCT)","confLoc":"Durham, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00269340.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039383S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"456","citationCount":"20","articleId":"269340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":269345,"authors":[{"name":"M.R.S.

The algorithm is tested on the European ST-T database. The algorithm is very fast in its recall state due to the NN, and uses the minimum amount of information, since it is applied on a one-lead ECG. The adaptive training backpropagation algorithm reduces dramatically the training time, and makes possible adjustment training. Even though the algorithm has some problems with detecting the exact onset and end of an ischemic episode, its performance was encouraging since it had a gross sensitivity of 84.4% for ischemia episode detection in the 60 out of 90 records on which it was initially tested. Thus, it seems to be suitable for use in critical care units due to its speed and training capabilities.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CIC.1992.269346","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Computers in Cardiology","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Computers in Cardiology","pdfPath":"/iel2/456/6708/00269346.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.1992.269346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6708","startPage":"663","endPage":"666","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-lead ischemia detection using a new backpropagation algorithm and the European ST-T database","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=269346","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"One-lead ischemia detection using a new backpropagation algorithm and the European ST-T database","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/269346/","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4595848","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-lead ischemia detection using a new backpropagation algorithm and the European ST-T database","confLoc":"Durham, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00269346.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049604S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"456","citationCount":"17","articleId":"269346","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":269348,"authors":[{"name":"H.-S.

Gross VEB sensitivity improved from 94.83% to 97.39% when the ANN system replaced the original beat classification logic, and gross VEB positive predictivity improved from 92.70% to 93.58%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CIC.1992.269348","pdfPath":"/iel2/456/6708/00269348.pdf","startPage":"659","endPage":"662","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings Computers in Cardiology","publicationTitle":"Proceedings Computers in Cardiology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.1992.269348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of ventricular ectopic beats using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/269348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Detection of ventricular ectopic beats using neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4595847","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of ventricular ectopic beats using neural networks","confLoc":"Durham, NC, USA","sourcePdf":"00269348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04321S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"456","citationCount":"12","articleId":"269348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":269417,"authors":[{"name":"F.

A procedure for locking neuron weights at specific locations in a region is presented. It exploits prior knowledge about the system of interest. As a result, superior representations of an arbitrary multivariable nonlinear mapping can be achieved. In addition, the common problem of twisted meshes in these neural networks is eliminated. The strategy introduced for preferentially training these networks at region boundaries overcomes the limitation of boundary contraction. As an example, a one-dimensional neural network is used to approximate a nonlinear function, although in general an n-dimensional mapping can be used to approximate an m-dimensional system for n<or=m. As a practical implementation, the modeling of the theoretical torque of a switched reluctance motor (SRM) as a function of position and current is presented. The topological torque representation is suitable for adaptive control of SRMs in high-performance applications.<<ETX>>","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1992.269794","startPage":"944","endPage":"949 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] The First IEEE Conference on Control Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.1992.269794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6711","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] The First IEEE Conference on Control Applications","pdfPath":"/iel2/554/6711/00269794.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling torque in a switched reluctance motor for adaptive control purposes using self-organizing neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/269794/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling torque in a switched reluctance motor for adaptive control purposes using self-organizing neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4584329","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling torque in a switched reluctance motor for adaptive control purposes using self-organizing neural networks","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00269794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063242S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1992","isNumber":"6711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"554","citationCount":"8","articleId":"269794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":269811,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

An algorithm is derived for backpropagating the error and updating adjustable parameters within a general gray layer that is consistent with existing learning techniques. As a practical application, gray layer technology is applied to the identification of switched reluctance motor characteristics on the basis of experimental measurements. The results demonstrate that artificial neural networks using gray layers converge faster, require fewer adjustable weights, and more accurately predict the unknown system. As a further illustration, a gray layer is applied to the identification of two differential partially known dynamic systems. Results exhibit a significant improvement in the quality of the identification model and an increase in the rate of convergence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1992.269811","pdfPath":"/iel2/554/6711/00269811.pdf","startPage":"571","endPage":"576 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] The First IEEE Conference on Control Applications","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] The First IEEE Conference on Control Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.1992.269811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identification of dynamic nonlinear systems using artificial neural networks incorporating a priori knowledge","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/269811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"Identification of dynamic nonlinear systems using artificial neural networks incorporating a priori knowledge","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4584312","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of dynamic nonlinear systems using artificial neural networks incorporating a priori knowledge","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00269811.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046682S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1992","isNumber":"6711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"554","citationCount":"2","articleId":"269811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":269812,"authors":[{"name":"T.L.

Three existing ANN training strategies are reviewed within this framework, including gradient-descent backpropagation, the extended Kalman algorithm, and the recursive-least-squares method. A strikingly different approach to error backpropagation is presented, resulting in the development of a novel method of backward signal propagation and target state generation for embedded layers. The technique is suitable for implementation with a linear Kalman-based update algorithm and is applied with a unique method of covariance modification for the elimination of transients associated with initial conditions. Experimental nonlinear identification results demonstrate a greatly increased rate of convergence in comparison with backpropagation. The new algorithm displayed similar rates of parameter convergence and a decreased computational overhead compared with the extended Kalman algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1992.269812","startPage":"565","endPage":"570 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] The First IEEE Conference on Control Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.1992.269812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6711","displayPublicationTitle":"[Proceedings 1992] The First IEEE Conference on Control Applications","pdfPath":"/iel2/554/6711/00269812.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A parameter estimation approach to artificial neural network weight selection for nonlinear system identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/269812/","displayDocTitle":"A parameter estimation approach to artificial neural network weight selection for nonlinear system identification","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4584311","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-16 Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 Sep 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A parameter estimation approach to artificial neural network weight selection for nonlinear system identification","confLoc":"Dayton, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00269812.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059669S","chronDate":"13-16 Sep 1992","isNumber":"6711","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"554","citationCount":"3","articleId":"269812","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":269814,"authors":[{"name":"J.
