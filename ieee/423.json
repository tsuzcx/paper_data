The receiver uses an architecture in which, thanks to the presence of a phase-locked loop, the quench oscillator is operated synchronously with the received data at a quench frequency equal to the data rate. This mode of operation has several benefits. Firstly, the traditional problem of poor selectivity in this type of receiver is to a large extent overcome. Secondly, considerably higher data rates can be achieved than with classical receivers. Thirdly, the bit envelope can be matched to the superregenerative oscillator, which improves sensitivity. The receiver includes an RF front end optimized to support high quench frequencies at low supply voltages, responding to todays increasing demand for high speed and low power consumption. The prototype implemented is very simple and achieves a data rate of 11 Mb/s with a current consumption of 1.75 mA at a supply voltage of 1.2 V - an excellent tradeoff between cost, performance, and power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.896796","startPage":"1355","endPage":"1362","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.896796","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4230871","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4230871/04230879.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An 11-Mb/s 2.1-mW Synchronous Superregenerative Receiver at 2.4 GHz","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4230879/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An 11-Mb/s 2.1-mW Synchronous Superregenerative Receiver at 2.4 GHz","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4230879/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9591058","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 11-Mb/s 2.1-mW Synchronous Superregenerative Receiver at 2.4 GHz","sourcePdf":"55tmtt06-moncunillgeniz-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063691S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4230871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4230871","articleId":"4230879","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4230881,"authors":[{"name":"Renato Negra","affiliation":["IRadio Laboratory, Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4230871/4230881/4230881-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Renato Negra (S'06\u2013M'07) received the M.Sc. degree in telematics from the Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, in 2006.","From 1998 to 2000, he was with Alcatel Space Norway AS (formerly AME Space AS), Horten, Norway, where he was involved in the design and characterization of space-qualified RF equipment.

In this paper, we are focused on subsystems combining a filter and an antenna. In a first step, the methodology consists of synthesizing the global subsystem, which realizes both filtering and radiation functions, with respect to overall specifications. Considering circuits interactions within the subsystem, the resulting constraints are distributed optimally between the two circuits. The latter mutual synthesis then leads, on one hand, to a set of optimal impedances for their connection and, on the other hand, to the corresponding ideal characteristics of each circuit. A solution can then be selected by carrying out a compromise between the simplicity of achieving the characteristics of each circuit and the performances and compactness of the subsystem. In a second step, the circuits are designed independently with respect to the synthesized characteristics. Compared to a classical synthesis approach, where circuits are synthesized independently with respect to a common reference impedance (generally 50 or 75 Omega), the proposed mutual synthesis allows to simplify the global subsystem since interactions between the two circuits are considered and used optimally. The technique is illustrated with the design of a filter-antenna at Ku-band.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual Synthesis of Combined Microwave Circuits Applied to the Design of a Filter-Antenna Subsystem","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.897719","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4230869/04230896.pdf","startPage":"1182","endPage":"1189","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.897719","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4230869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4230896","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4230896/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Mutual Synthesis of Combined Microwave Circuits Applied to the Design of a Filter-Antenna Subsystem","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4230896/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591203","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual Synthesis of Combined Microwave Circuits Applied to the Design of a Filter-Antenna Subsystem","sourcePdf":"55tmtt06-troubat-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084797S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4230869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4230869","articleId":"4230896","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4230900,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander G.

The radar produces 3D images of subsurface by 1D mechanical scanning. The imaging capability of the radar is realized via electronic steering of the receive antenna footprint in a cross-scan direction and synthetic aperture processing in an along-scan direction.

To this end, a novel Heuristic Genetic Algorithm (HGA) to solve the SSSP problem is developed and evaluated. The proposed algorithm employs knowledge from deterministic techniques and the genetic mechanism to achieve high performance and allow consistent convergence. In addition, the proposed HGA is implemented and evaluated using a developed software tool that is easily amenable for future extensions and variations of our HGA. The schema introduced in this proposal depends on starting with initial population of candidate solution paths constraints as an alternative of a randomly generated one. To preserve the high performance candidate solutions, the HGA also uses a new heuristic order crossover (HOC) operator and mutation (HSM) operator to keep the search limited to feasible search domain. Simulation results indicate that the developed HGA is highly efficient in finding an optimal also quantify the effect initial population size and the increase of generation numbers.","doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2007.370882","startPage":"187","endPage":"194","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2007.370882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4230921","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4230920/4230921/04230957.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Heuristic Genetic Algorithm for the Single Source Shortest Path Problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4230957/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Heuristic Genetic Algorithm for the Single Source Shortest Path Problem","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4230957/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9854902","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Heuristic Genetic Algorithm for the Single Source Shortest Path Problem","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"AICCSA-00-36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100074S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4230920","isNumber":"4230921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4230920","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4230921","articleId":"4230957","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4230965,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Cell placement is an NP-complete problem, for which we intend to devise an adaptive genetic algorithm. Genetic algorithms have many parameters such as population size, mutation rate, crossover rate, and selection strategy, which are constants most of the time and need to be carefully set for efficient implementation. However, adaptive approaches tend to vary one or more of those parameters as the process evolve. In this work, we propose a scheme to adjust the population size in a way that provides a balance between exploration and exploitation, hence result in a time-efficient implementation of genetic algorithms. We compare this scheme with three sizing schemes proposed in the literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4230984/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9854929","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4230984/","publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Population Sizing Scheme for Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Population Sizing Scheme for Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"AICCSA-00-63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056614S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4230920","isNumber":"4230921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4230920","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4230921","articleId":"4230984","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4230998,"authors":[{"name":"Faycal Bensaali","affiliation":["University of Herfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Faycal","lastName":"Bensaali","id":"37265538600"},{"name":"Abbes Amira","affiliation":["Brunei University, UK"],"firstName":"Abbes","lastName":"Amira","id":"37270846500"},{"name":"Reza Sotudeh","affiliation":["University of Herfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Sotudeh","id":"37284446100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1030-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1031-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-5322"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-5330"}],"articleNumber":"4230998","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Arithmetic","Scientific computing","Adders","Application software","Concurrent computing","Numerical stability","Costs","High performance computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","affine transforms","field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","matrix multiplication","multiplying circuits","natural sciences computing","parallel processing","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix product","FPGA","scientific computing application","reconfigurable hardware","field-programable gate array","floating-point adder","parallel floating-point matrix multiplier","3D affine transformation"]}],"abstract":"The nature of some scientific computing applications involves performing complex tasks repeatedly on floating-point data, often under real-time requirements.

However in the case of noisy MR images, efficiency of this algorithm considerably reduces. Recently, researchers have been introduced two new parameters in order to improve performance of traditional FCM in the case of noisy images. New parameters are computed using artificial neural networks and through an optimization problem, where need complex and time consuming computations. In this paper, we present a new method for efficient computation of these two parameters. We used genetic algorithm (GA) optimization method and showed capability of GA for finding optimal values of these parameters. Simplification of computation is advantage of new proposed method. Simulation results using noisy MR images, demonstrated effectiveness of proposed optimization method for noisy MR image segmentation. 1.

Efforts on partitioning between the microprocessor and the FPGA are often times a manual and laborious effort as a formal methodology for automatic hardware-software partitioning for RC systems has not yet been established. Related fields such as heterogeneous computing (HC) and embedded computing (EC) have an extensive body of work for scheduling for heterogeneous processors. In this work, we adapt HC scheduling algorithms for RC systems, and show how simply adapting the algorithms alone is not sufficient to take advantage of the reconfigurable hardware. In many cases, the HC heuristics algorithms do not generate efficient schedules necessary to take advantage of the synergy between the microprocessor and the FPGA. We introduce new heuristic algorithms based on HC scheduling algorithms and show that they provide up to an order of magnitude improvement in execution time.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2007.370744","doi":"10.1109/AICCSA.2007.370744","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4230920/4230921/04231072.pdf","startPage":"942","endPage":"949","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE/ACS International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4230921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of Heterogeneous Computing in Hardware/Software Co-Scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Applications of Heterogeneous Computing in Hardware/Software Co-Scheduling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231072/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 May 2007","conferenceDate":"13-16 May 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9855014","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4231072/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of Heterogeneous Computing in Hardware/Software Co-Scheduling","confLoc":"Amman, Jordan","sourcePdf":"AICCSA-00-151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061131S","chronDate":"13-16 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4230920","isNumber":"4230921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4230920","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4230921","articleId":"4231072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4231209,"authors":[{"name":"Peter S.

In particular, the kappa-mu distribution is better suited for line-of-sight applications, whereas the eta-mu distribution gives better results for non-line-of-sight applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231253/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","volume":"49","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9450089","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4231253/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The \u03ba-\u03bc distribution and the \u03b7-\u03bc distribution","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The \u03ba-\u03bc distribution and the \u03b7-\u03bc distribution","sourcePdf":"492007-Michel-19.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118742S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"4227917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"579","xplore-issue":"4227917","articleId":"4231253","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":4231309,"authors":[{"name":"Karl F.

Both frequency dispersion and spatial dispersion effects in wire media are taken into account using the auxiliary differential equation method. According to the authors' knowledge, this is the first time when the spatial dispersion effect is considered in the FDTD modelling. The stability of developed spatially dispersive FDTD formulations is analyzed through the use of von Neumann method combined with the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. The results show that the conventional stability Courant limit is preserved using standard discretization scheme for wire media modelling. Flat sub-wavelength lenses formed by wire media are chosen for validation of proposed spatially dispersive FDTD formulation. Results of the simulations demonstrate excellent sub-wavelength imaging capability of the wire medium slabs. The size of the simulation domain is significantly reduced using the modified perfectly matched layer (MPML) which can be placed in close vicinity of the wire medium. It is demonstrated that the reflections from the MPML-wire medium interface are less than-70 dB, that lead to dramatic improvement of convergence compared to conventional simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4231310/04231315.pdf","startPage":"1506","endPage":"1513","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.897320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.897320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231310","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231315","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling of Wave Propagation in Wire Media Using Spatially Dispersive Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method: Numerical Aspects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wire","Dispersion","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Dielectrics","Frequency","Differential equations","Stability analysis","Stability criteria","Lenses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conducting bodies","differential equations","finite difference time-domain analysis","metamaterials","wave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel ideally conducting thin wires","metamaterials","MPML","modified perfectly matched layer","sub-wavelength lenses","discretization scheme","Routh-Hurwitz criterion","von Neumann method","auxiliary differential equation method","spatial dispersion effects","frequency dispersion","FDTD","artificial dielectrics","spatially dispersive finite-difference time-domain method","wire media","wave propagation modelling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial dielectrics and metamaterials","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)","spatial dispersion","wire medium"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Modelling of Wave Propagation in Wire Media Using Spatially Dispersive Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method: Numerical Aspects","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4231315/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9744206","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling of Wave Propagation in Wire Media Using Spatially Dispersive Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method: Numerical Aspects","sourcePdf":"55tap06-zhao-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131037S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4231310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4231310","articleId":"4231315","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4231316,"authors":[{"name":"Gunhyun Ahn","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4230869/4231316/4231316-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gunhyun Ahn was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1978.

An optimum load matching network and an additional offset line, after the matching network of the carrier amplifier, dynamically modulate the load impedance according to the input power drive, while the conventional Doherty power amplifier uses a quarter-wave line to do it. The operational principles and design guide are provided. For experimental verification, a 50-W Doherty amplifier was designed for the pi/4 differential quadrature phase-shift keying application at the 860-MHz band. The measured performance of the IDPA was compared with that of the balanced class-AB amplifier with the same output matching network. At an output power of 50 W, the IDPA performs with 3.16 dB better adjacent channel power ratio (-28 versus -24.84 dBc) and 6.15% higher power-added efficiency (59.02 versus 52.87%) than the class-AB amplifier does.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4231316/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591186","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of a High-Efficiency and High-Power Inverted Doherty Amplifier","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a High-Efficiency and High-Power Inverted Doherty Amplifier","sourcePdf":"55tmtt06-ahn-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090448S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4230869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4230869","articleId":"4231316","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4231317,"authors":[{"name":"Smain Amari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4230869/4231317/4231317-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Smain Amari (M'98) received the D.E.S. degree in physics and electronics from Constantine University, Constantine, Algeria, in 1985, and the Masters degree in electrical engineering and Ph.D. degree in physics from Washington University, St. Louis, MO, in 1989 and 1994, respectively.","From 1994 to 2000, he was with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada.

It is shown that certain similarity transformations contain important ldquoglobalrdquo information that can be used to get insight into the workings of microwave bandpass filters. Instead of focusing on the effect a similarity transformation has on the original coupling matrix, the change of basis that the similarity transformation represents is considered the main operation.

The transversal matrix emerges as a universal and natural representation of coupled resonator bandpass filters of arbitrary orders, responses, and topologies. It can be used as an equivalent circuit in the optimization and diagnosis of bandpass coupled resonator filters. The results of this study have far reaching implications not only for the theory and design of microwave filters, but other circuits as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4230869/04231317.pdf","startPage":"1139","endPage":"1153","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.897706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.897706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4230869","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical Interpretation and Implications of Similarity Transformations in Coupled Resonator Filter Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonator filters","Band pass filters","Microwave filters","Coupling circuits","Transversal filters","Circuit topology","Equivalent circuits","Microwave theory and techniques","Filtering theory","Microwave circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","microwave filters","resonator filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global eigenmodes","transversal matrix","original coupling matrix","microwave bandpass filters","coupled resonator filter design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Eigenmode","resonator filters","similarity transformation","synthesis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Physical Interpretation and Implications of Similarity Transformations in Coupled Resonator Filter Design","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4231317/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591187","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical Interpretation and Implications of Similarity Transformations in Coupled Resonator Filter Design","sourcePdf":"55tmtt06-amari-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099638S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4230869","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4230869","articleId":"4231317","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4231334,"authors":[{"name":"Oualid Hammi","affiliation":["IRadio Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4230871/4231334/4231334-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Oualid Hammi (S'03) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from the \u00c9cole Nationale d'Ing\u00e9nieurs de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia, in 2001, the M.Sc. degree from \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada, in 2004, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree at the University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.","His current research interests are in the area of microwave and millimeter-wave engineering in general.

This study covers two aspects: the processing of the power amplifier (PA) input and output measured data intended for the extraction of the corresponding predistortion function, and the optimal setting of the predistorter's small-signal gain to adaptively track the average power variation between the input and output of the pre-distorter. First, the accuracy of the polynomial curve fitting and the lookup table's scheme in mimicking the measured AM/AM and AM/PM characteristics of the PA is investigated. To address the high dispersion of coefficients of the polynomial function, which limits the order that can be implemented and the fitting capabilities, a pre-processing technique is proposed. Second, the fitted PA curves are used to investigate the effects of the small-signal gain of the predistortion function on the linearization performance. An automated average power tracking technique is introduced in order to maintain a unit average gain of the predistorter. The measured spectra at the output of the amplifier show an additional 12-dBc improvement in the output spectrum regrowth.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Predistortion","High power amplifiers","Polynomials","Power amplifiers","Power measurement","Gain measurement","Data mining","Curve fitting","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit analysis computing","curve fitting","linearisation techniques","power amplifiers","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated average power tracking","linearization performance","pre-processing technique","AM/PM characteristics","AM/AM characteristics","lookup table scheme","polynomial curve fitting","small-signal gain","highly nonlinear power amplifiers","digital predistortion function synthesis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital predistorter (DPD)","lookup table (LUT)","nonlinearity","polynomial model","power amplifier (PA)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2007.895237","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/4230871/04231334.pdf","startPage":"1382","endPage":"1389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4230871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2007.895237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Robustness of Digital Predistortion Function Synthesis and Average Power Tracking for Highly Nonlinear Power Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231334","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Robustness of Digital Predistortion Function Synthesis and Average Power Tracking for Highly Nonlinear Power Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231334/","volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4231334/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9591052","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Robustness of Digital Predistortion Function Synthesis and Average Power Tracking for Highly Nonlinear Power Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"55tmtt06-hammi-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049506S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"4230871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4230871","articleId":"4231334","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4231339,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Hun Ji","affiliation":["School of Electronics Telecommunication and Computer Engineering, Korea Aviation University, Goyang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4230871/4231339/4231339-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seung Hun Ji was born in Seoul, Korea, in 1981.

The course starts with the basics of hardware description languages and FPGA programming, discusses the differences between FPGA and standard cell designs, introduces concepts like SoCs and NoCs, and ends up with an introduction to reconfigurable computing. Covering such a broad range of topics, the main challenges for this course are to give the students a rough understanding of the context and problems in the field of hardware design, and to focus on the basic concepts instead of providing detailed knowledge of one software tool or FPGA type. The course is very strongly related to the reconfigurable computing research activities at our institute so that students will be motivated to do their Master thesis in this field. Experiences in teaching such an all-in- one course are given and the pros and cons in choosing the course topics are discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Microelectronic Systems Education (MSE'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4231411/4231412/04231435.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"32","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Microelectronic Systems Education (MSE'07)","doi":"10.1109/MSE.2007.82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSE.2007.82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231412","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Teaching Informatics Students the Secrets of Hardware Design","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Education","Informatics","Hardware","Books","Field programmable gate arrays","Circuit synthesis","Network-on-a-chip","Testing","Signal synthesis","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering education","field programmable gate arrays","teaching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware design course","informatics","hardware description language","FPGA programming","standard cell design","reconfigurable computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Teaching Informatics Students the Secrets of Hardware Design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4231435/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9857805","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"3-4 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Teaching Informatics Students the Secrets of Hardware Design","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"28490031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033464S","chronDate":"3-4 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4231411","isNumber":"4231412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4231411","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4231412","articleId":"4231435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4231440,"authors":[{"name":"Tarmo Robal","affiliation":["Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Tarmo","lastName":"Robal","id":"37680417300"},{"name":"Ahto Kalja","affiliation":["Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia"],"firstName":"Ahto","lastName":"Kalja","id":"37372487200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2849-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4231440","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying e-Environments in Teaching the Basics of Digital Logic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Education","Logic","Modeling","Circuit simulation","Internet","Electronic learning","Systems engineering and theory","Problem-solving","Combinational circuits","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","electronic engineering education","Internet","logic circuits","teaching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["e-environments","digital logic teaching","Internet","e-learning system","Web-based tools"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231440","abstract":"The development of the Internet has made it possible to move studies to e-environments, where time and distance are not obstacles any more.

We use a K-map based methodology to introduce a few novel nano-logic design concepts for the undergraduate logic design class. We want them to possess knowledge about a few fundamental abstracted logical behaviors of future nano-devices and their functionality which in turn would motivate them to further investigate these non-CMOS emerging devices, logics and architectures. This would augment critical thinking of the students where they apply the learnt knowledge to a novel/unfamiliar situation. We intend to augment the existing standard EE and CS courses by inserting K-map based knowledge modules on nano-logic structure for stimulating their interest without significant diversion from the course framework. Experiments with our students show that all the students were able to grasp the basic concept of majority logic synthesis and almost 63% of them had a deeper understanding of the synthesis algorithm demonstrated to them.","doi":"10.1109/MSE.2007.52","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSE.2007.52","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Microelectronic Systems Education (MSE'07)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Microelectronic Systems Education (MSE'07)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4231411/4231412/04231447.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Integrating Nano-logic into an Undergraduate Logic Design Course","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-4 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9966974","htmlLink":"/document/4231447/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating Nano-logic into an Undergraduate Logic Design Course","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"28490055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056141S","chronDate":"3-4 June 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4231411","isNumber":"4231412","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4231411","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4231412","articleId":"4231447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4231450,"authors":[{"name":"Dan Fay","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Fay","id":"37412366700"},{"name":"Scott Campbell","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Campbell","id":"37687592800"},{"name":"Greg Miller","affiliation":["Xilinx, Inc., Longmont, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Greg","lastName":"Miller","id":"37693874300"},{"name":"Dan Connors","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Connors","id":"37274473900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2849-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4231450","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":239},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Education","Fault tolerance","Field programmable gate arrays","Single event transient","Logic design","Programmable logic arrays","Space technology","Error correction","Single event upset","Application specific integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["educational courses","electronic engineering education","fault tolerant computing","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit reliability","logic design","space vehicle electronics","SRAM chips","teaching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant FPGA design teaching","aerospace applications","field programmable gate arrays","SRAM-based FPGA","integrated circuit designs","soft error upsets","FPGA reliability"]}],"abstract":"Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), particularly high-density, SRAM-based FPGAs, have vastly increased in features and capabilities to the point where they are a useful, low Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) alternative to low-to-medium volume custom integrated circuit designs.

The preliminary experiments validate the feasibility of using Time-Domain Synchronous Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (TDS-OFDM) technology, a core technology in DMB-T and being adopted in Chinese Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting Standard, for powerline communication. TDS-OFDM offers higher spectrum efficiency as known pseudo random sequence is used as the guard interval (or frame header) and also serves the purpose of synchronization and channel estimation

Indeed, as it requires no guard interval, it has the advantage of a theoretical higher spectral efficiency. Furthermore, if the pulse shape is well-localized in frequency, the resulting OFDM/OQAM signal satisfies stringent spectrum requirements. However, the classical channel estimation methods used for OFDM cannot be directly applied to OFDM/OQAM. In this paper we present an analysis of this problem and we describe a method for perfect channel estimation in OFDM/OQAM. Then we introduce two new realistic preamble-based channel estimation methods. The performance results are obtained by considering the transmission of an OFDM/OQAM signal over a multi-path power line communication (PLC) channel model. The proposed channel estimation methods are compared to the ones obtained with CP-OFDM.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preamble-based channel estimation techniques for OFDM/OQAM over the powerline","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371098","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4231617/4231618/04231672.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231618","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231672","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Preamble-based channel estimation techniques for OFDM/OQAM over the powerline","conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4231672/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9701509","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preamble-based channel estimation techniques for OFDM/OQAM over the powerline","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"ISPLC-00-54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074795S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4231617","isNumber":"4231618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4231617","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4231618","articleId":"4231672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4231674,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Skrzypczak","affiliation":["IETR/Supelec, Cesson-Sevigne, France","Research and Development Division, France Telecom Research and Development Center, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Skrzypczak","id":"37293778700"},{"name":"Pierre Siohan","affiliation":["Research and Development Division, France Telecom Research and Development Center, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Siohan","id":"37293775600"},{"name":"Jean-Philippe Javaudin","affiliation":["Research and Development Division, France Telecom Research and Development Center, Cesson-Sevigne, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Philippe","lastName":"Javaudin","id":"37293776600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1089-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1090-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4231674","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":290},"abstract":"In power line communications, multicarrier modulation is an efficient way to transmit information at a very high data rate.

Among these parallelisms it is worthwhile to mention that both systems are essentially multihop and operate in a very noisy environment. For this reason the present paper reviews relevant results in the field of WSN with application to PLC based AMR systems and extracts lessons applicable to AMR and to PLC in general. Based on these lessons, this paper develops a theoretical model called the \"star of chains model\" with regularly spaced devices forming chains that connect to a concentrator station, which is useful to derive the capacity of a system and to provide some basic rules of the thumb for creating it. A specific and simple MAC layer protocol based on the WSN protocol known as \"ripple control\" is proposed to take the most out of the presented model. This protocol allows for good throughput while coping with the necessary retransmissions in noisy environments and with the necessary creation of periods of contention for the automatic registration of new nodes. The protocol may useful also for other applications in narrow band PLC as well as in broadband powerline communications (BPL). A simulation based on OPNET modeler has been developed to check the capacity calculations. The model and protocol presented are a first step that will be refined and extended in the future.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371105","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4231617/4231618/04231679.pdf","startPage":"98","endPage":"103","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lessons Learned from Wireless Sensor Networks with Application to AMR and PLC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Lessons Learned from Wireless Sensor Networks with Application to AMR and PLC","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4231679/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9701516","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231679/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lessons Learned from Wireless Sensor Networks with Application to AMR and PLC","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"ISPLC-00-61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079684S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4231617","isNumber":"4231618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4231617","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4231618","articleId":"4231679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4231680,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Its behavioral model includes both the long-and short-time variation of the channel. The long-time variation is due to the electrical appliances switching and is modeled in a statistical way. The cyclic short-time variation is related to the presence of the mains voltage and is characterized modeling the channel response as a linear periodically time-variant (LPTV) system and including an additive cyclostationary noise term. The cyclic model is simplified by using a slow variation approach, so that the channel can be modeled by means of a cyclic sequence of LTI systems with stationary noise terms. Channels according to the behavioral model are generated based on the physical structure of the network. The model for this physical structure comprises: the wiring, characterized as a set of terminated transmission lines connected in a tree-like fashion; and the electrical appliances, which are modeled as electric bipoles acting as impedances and noise sources. The simulator can perform the calculation of the channel frequency response and noise power spectral density at the receiver given a network topology. Afterwards, a channel simulation can be carried out using two banks of filters, one for the LPTV channel response and the other to obtain cyclostationary noise by filtering AWGN. Some test results for the channel generation and simulation are presented, and practical applications of this simulator are discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231680/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2007","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9701517","publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4231680/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Channel Simulator for Indoor Power-line Communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Channel Simulator for Indoor Power-line Communications","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"ISPLC-00-62.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043439S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4231617","isNumber":"4231618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4231617","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4231618","articleId":"4231680","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4231686,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The performances of the proposed DMT systems with and without LDPC codes are analyzed for the broadband PLC system design.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Parity check codes","OFDM modulation","Programmable control","Error correction codes","Bit error rate","Power system modeling","DSL","Algorithm design and analysis","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit-loading algorithms","powerline channel","low density parity check coding","bit-error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bit-loading","DMT","LDPC","PLC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231703","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371129","startPage":"234","endPage":"239","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4231617/4231618/04231703.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231618","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231703/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of LDPC Coded DMT Systems with Bit-loading Algorithms for Powerline Channel","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9701540","htmlLink":"/document/4231703/","conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of LDPC Coded DMT Systems with Bit-loading Algorithms for Powerline Channel","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"ISPLC-00-85.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0576S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4231617","isNumber":"4231618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4231617","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4231618","articleId":"4231703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4231705,"authors":[{"name":"Keita Izumi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Keita","lastName":"Izumi","id":"37695572100"},{"name":"Daisuke Umehara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Daisuke","lastName":"Umehara","id":"37283471400"},{"name":"Satoshi Denno","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Denno","id":"37279596500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1089-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1090-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4231705","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":480},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","OFDM modulation","Equalizers","Power line communications","Radiofrequency interference","Radio communication","Degradation","Multipath channels","Filter bank","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet OFDM","power line communication","inhome networks","unwanted electric waves","harmful interference","radio communication systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","transmit signal power spectrum","guard interval","multipath channels","power line channels","adaptive sine modulated filter bank equalizer","adaptive cosine modulated filter bank equalizer","transmultiplexers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ASCET","channel estimation","multicarrier modulation","power line communication","wavelet OFDM"]}],"abstract":"Power line communication (PLC) is one of the most attractive communication methods for in-home networks. However, the emissions of unwanted electric waves from PLC system cause harmful interference to other radio communication systems with the same frequency band. Wavelet OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) is expected to be an efficient modulation for PLC because it can make steep and deep notch for any frequency band in the transmit signal power spectrum. However, wavelet OFDM cannot implement the equalization by guard interval (GI) like OFDM and causes performance degradation in multipath channels including power line channels. In this paper, we apply ASCET (Adaptive Sine modulated / Cosine modulated filter bank Equalizer for Transmultiplexers) to wavelet OFDM and evaluate its performance over a multipath power line channel. In particular, we propose an estimation scheme of equalizer coefficients for ASCET that the required preamble becomes short. We compare the performance of OFDM with GI to that of wavelet OFDM with ASCET over the multipath power line channel by computer simulations. As a result, we show that the proposed scheme can achieve the approximately equivalent performance of OFDM with GI by using the shorter preamble as compared to the original scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Wavelet OFDM Using ASCET","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371131","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4231617/4231618/04231705.pdf","startPage":"246","endPage":"251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231618","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231705","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231705/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Performance Evaluation of Wavelet OFDM Using ASCET","conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4231705/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9701542","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Evaluation of Wavelet OFDM Using ASCET","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"ISPLC-00-87.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064196S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4231617","isNumber":"4231618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4231617","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4231618","articleId":"4231705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4231711,"authors":[{"name":"T.A.

A problem of the PLC is that leakage radiation interferes to existing systems. When OFDM is used in PLC system, the leakage radiation is not sufficiently reduced, even if the subcarriers corresponding to frequency-band of the existing system are never used, because the signal is not strictly band-limited. To solve this problem, each subcarrier must be band-limited. In this paper, we apply the OQAM based multi-carrier transmission (OQAM-MCT) to high-speed PLC system, where each subcarrier is individually band-limited. We also propose a pilot-symbol sequence for frequency offset estimation, symbol-timing detection and channel estimation in the OQAM-MCT system. In this method, the pilot signal-sequence consists of the succession of the same data symbol. Computer simulation results show that the OQAM-MCT system achieves both good transmission rate performance and low out-of-band radiation in the PLC channels. It is also shown that the proposed pilot-sequence improves frequency offset estimation, symbol-timing detection and channel estimation performance as compared with the case of using pseudo-noise sequence.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371139","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4231617/4231618/04231713.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Speed Power-Line Communication System with band-limited OQAM based Multi-Carrier Transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231713/","displayDocTitle":"A High-Speed Power-Line Communication System with band-limited OQAM based Multi-Carrier Transmission","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9701550","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4231713/","conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Speed Power-Line Communication System with band-limited OQAM based Multi-Carrier Transmission","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"ISPLC-00-95.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049999S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4231617","isNumber":"4231618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4231617","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4231618","articleId":"4231713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4231714,"authors":[{"name":"Nikoleta Andreadou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Telecommunications Division, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikoleta","lastName":"Andreadou","id":"37396539100"},{"name":"Costas Assimakopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Telecommunications Division, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Costas","lastName":"Assimakopoulos","id":"37284848300"},{"name":"Fotini-Niovi Pavlidou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Telecommunications Division, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Fotini-Niovi","lastName":"Pavlidou","id":"37271709500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1089-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1090-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4231714","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":427},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Programmable control","Bit error rate","Power line communications","OFDM modulation","Binary phase shift keying","Sparse matrices","Decoding","Attenuation measurement","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","convolutional codes","decoding","encoding","impulse noise","OFDM modulation","parity check codes","phase shift keying","Reed-Solomon codes","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance evaluation","LDPC codes","PLC channel","power line communications","coding techniques","LDPC coding scheme","modulation method","BPSK","transmission technique","OFDM","sparse parity check matrix","decoding technique","BER","Reed-Solomon codes","code rate","convolutional codes","impulsive noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power Line Communications (PLC)","Low Density Parity Check Codes (LDPC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231714","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4231617/4231618/04231714.pdf","startPage":"296","endPage":"301","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371140","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231618","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Evaluation of LDPC Codes on PLC Channel Compared to Other Coding Schemes","abstract":"In this paper we study how power line communications are affected by different coding techniques.

However the characteristics of power-line channels in the cargo ships have not been studied yet. The most unique point of the channels is that power-line cables used in most Asian cargo ships are shielded. In order to characterize the channel and investigate a suitable PLC system to the cargo ships, some parameters were measured in three typical ships. The parameters were the transfer functions (LCTR, LTR and TTR), LCL and stationary noise spectrum. From these measurements, (1) the required dynamic range of receivers, (2) average attenuation at distribution boards, (3) phase coupling loss and (4) average LCL values were derived in this paper. Since the cables are shielded and the hull provides the good ground, the usage of the common-mode transmission in addition to the conventional differential-mode, which is referred to as a dual-mode transmission system, is also proposed. Therefore the measured parameters above were included the common-mode and mode-conversion properties. As the evidence to support our proposal, some results in which the LCTR values were superior to the TTR values are shown.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line

The study was led in close collaboration with the Institute for Information and Communication Technologies, the Swiss Federal Office of Communication and, in the framework of the OPERA project, with the EMC team of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne. Numerical simulations and experimental measurements of a simplified PLC setup were used to carry out an initial study on a number of aspects of the relation between the radiated field and the common-mode current and the impact of the resonances present in the PLC network. A detailed analysis of a 1:1 scale representative room built on our open area test site, which includes several appliances, power outlets, switched outlets and lighting fixtures in its layout, allowed us to elaborate a simplified electrical model describing the generation mechanisms and the nature of the common-mode current flowing in the power line cables. Several results show that the magnetic near field, close to the wire line, exhibits large spatial variations over the whole frequency range from 1 to 30 MHz, which can be as high as 45 dB due to the resonances taking place in the setup. In addition, variations of the common-mode current as high as 35 dB have been observed, engendering a spread of the K factor of 20 dB. A detailed analysis also revealed large variations in the wave impedance, which ranged from some 50 ohms to more than 1000 ohms depending on the proximity to the standing waves along the line, implying that emission levels can be greatly underestimated or overestimated if their analysis is limited to the magnetic field. Our results indicate that the common-mode current generated along the power-line cables is mainly due to electrical asymmetries stemming mainly from switched loads or switched outlets. Perhaps one of the most important results of this study is the fact that the high variability of the common-mode current along the line makes difficult to evaluate the disturbance potential of a setup from measurements of the CM current at a single point.","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371149","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4231617/4231618/04231723.pdf","startPage":"348","endPage":"354","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Common mode current and radiations mechanisms in PLC networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231723/","displayDocTitle":"Common mode current and radiations mechanisms in PLC networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9701561","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4231723/","conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Common mode current and radiations mechanisms in PLC networks","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"ISPLC-00-105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067865S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4231617","isNumber":"4231618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4231617","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4231618","articleId":"4231723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4231727,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Antonio Cortes","affiliation":["Departamento de Ingenier\u00eda de Comunicaciones, University of M\u00e0laga, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose Antonio","lastName":"Cortes","id":"37414384500"},{"name":"Andrea M.

By means of multiconductor matrix procedure already presented by the authors in previous researches, the feasibility of power line carrier applications will be demonstrated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of PLC for the Control and the Protection of Future Distribution Networks","doi":"10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371175","startPage":"499","endPage":"504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPLC.2007.371175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231618","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Symposium on Power Line Communications and Its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4231617/4231618/04231749.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231749","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Application of PLC for the Control and the Protection of Future Distribution Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4231749/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9701591","conferenceDate":"26-28 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of PLC for the Control and the Protection of Future Distribution Networks","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"ISPLC-00-131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056413S","chronDate":"26-28 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4231617","isNumber":"4231618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4231617","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4231618","articleId":"4231749","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4231769,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Lv","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Lv","id":"37686328900"},{"name":"Huimin Lin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Huimin","lastName":"Lin","id":"37279365800"},{"name":"Hong Pan","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Pan","id":"37691924200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1050-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4231769","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Coherence","Safety","Humans","Laboratories","Computer science","Context modeling","Communication system security","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["abstract data types","cache storage","data integrity","program verification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter abstraction","combining invariants computing","guard strengthening methods","parameterized model checking","cache coherence protocols","transition rules","data consistency error"]}],"abstract":"A new approach to combining invariants computing and guard strengthening methods is presented in the context of parameter abstraction for parameterized model checking of cache coherence protocols. The approach uses a small instance of a parameterized protocol as a \"reference model\" to compute candidate invariants. References to a specific node in these candidate invariants are then abstracted away, and the resulting formulas are used to strengthen guards of the transition rules in the abstract node. The correctness of the approach is guaranteed by symmetry which exists in many parameterized systems. A number of case studies have been carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. During the process a data consistency error was identified and fixed in the German 2004 cache coherence protocol.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computing Invariants for Parameter Abstraction","publicationTitle":"2007 5th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Formal Methods and Models for Codesign (MEMOCODE 2007)","doi":"10.1109/MEMCOD.2007.371252","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 5th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Formal Methods and Models for Codesign (MEMOCODE 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4231755/4231756/04231769.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"38","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMCOD.2007.371252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231756","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231769","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 2 2007","displayDocTitle":"Computing Invariants for Parameter Abstraction","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4231769/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"May-June 2007","accessionNumber":"10355342","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computing Invariants for Parameter Abstraction","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"MEMCOD-00-13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.127459S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4231755","isNumber":"4231756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4231755","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4231756","articleId":"4231769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4231774,"authors":[{"name":"Man Cheuk Ng","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Man Cheuk","lastName":"Ng","id":"37538250000"},{"name":"Muralidaran Vijayaraghavan","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Muralidaran","lastName":"Vijayaraghavan","id":"37546101500"},{"name":"Nirav Dave","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Nirav","lastName":"Dave","id":"37412292900"},{"name":"Arvind","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA"],"lastName":"Arvind","id":"37283571400"},{"name":"Gopal Raghavan","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center Cambridge, Nokia Corporation, UK"],"firstName":"Gopal","lastName":"Raghavan","id":"37700070400"},{"name":"Jamey Hicks","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center Cambridge, Nokia Corporation, UK"],"firstName":"Jamey","lastName":"Hicks","id":"37692764200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1050-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4231774","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Wireless application protocol","Frequency division multiplexing","Digital modulation","OFDM modulation","Bit rate","Robustness","Interference","Baseband","Time to market"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IP networks","OFDM modulation","protocols","Viterbi decoding","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WiFi","WiMAX","high-level IP reuse","OFDM protocols","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","digital wireless protocols","wireless protocol","Bluespec","implementation-grounded algorithmic exploration","Viterbi decoder"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has become the preferred modulation scheme for both broadband and high bitrate digital wireless protocols because of its spectral efficiency and robustness against multipath interference. Although the components and overall structure of different OFDM protocols are functionally similar, the characteristics of the environment for which a wireless protocol is designed often result in different instantiations of various components. In this paper, we describe how we can instantiate baseband processoring of two different wireless protocols, namely 802.11a and 802.16 in Bluespec from a highly parameterized code for a generic OFDM protocol. Our approach results in highly reusable IP blocks that can dramatically reduce the time-to-market of new OFDM protocols. One advantage of Bluespec over SystemC is that our code is synthesizable into high quality hardware, which we demonstrate via synthesis results. Using a Viterbi decoder we also demonstrate how parameterization can be used to study area-performance tradeoff in the implementation of a module. Furthermore, parameterized modules and modular composition can facilitate implementation-grounded algorithmic exploration in the design of new protocols.","doi":"10.1109/MEMCOD.2007.371247","publicationTitle":"2007 5th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Formal Methods and Models for Codesign (MEMOCODE 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 5th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Formal Methods and Models for Codesign (MEMOCODE 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4231755/4231756/04231774.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"80","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMCOD.2007.371247","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"From WiFi to WiMAX: Techniques for High-Level IP Reuse across Different OFDM Protocols","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231774","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 2 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231774/","displayDocTitle":"From WiFi to WiMAX: Techniques for High-Level IP Reuse across Different OFDM Protocols","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 2007","accessionNumber":"10355346","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4231774/","conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From WiFi to WiMAX: Techniques for High-Level IP Reuse across Different OFDM Protocols","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"MEMCOD-00-18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059859S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4231755","isNumber":"4231756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4231755","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4231756","articleId":"4231774","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":4231782,"authors":[{"name":"Nirav Dave","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Nirav","lastName":"Dave","id":"37412292900"},{"name":"Kermin Fleming","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Kermin","lastName":"Fleming","id":"37686121200"},{"name":"Myron King","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Myron","lastName":"King","id":"37686382500"},{"name":"Michael Pellauer","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Pellauer","id":"37546240200"},{"name":"Muralidaran Vijayaraghavan","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Muralidaran","lastName":"Vijayaraghavan","id":"37546101500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1050-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4231782","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1300},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Field programmable gate arrays","Switches","Communication system control","Control systems","Random access memory","Computer science","Artificial intelligence","Hardware design languages","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","hardware-software codesign","matrix multiplication","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware acceleration","matrix multiplication","hardware-software co-design","optimisation","FPGA","PowerPC","Xilinx Virtex IIPro30","DRAM","Blue-spec SystemVerilog"]}],"abstract":"The first MEMOCODE hardware/software co-design contest posed the following problem: optimize matrix-matrix multiplication in such a way that it is split between the FPGA and PowerPC on a Xilinx Virtex IIPro30.

Current work in automatic task partitioning and scheduling for reconfigurable systems strictly addresses the FPGA hardware, and does not take advantage of the synergy between the microprocessor and the FPGA. In this work, we consider the problem of co-scheduling task graphs on reconfigurable systems. The target systems have an execution model which allows any subtask that can run on the FPGA to also run on the microprocessor, and allows reconfigurability of the FPGA (subject to area, performance, resource, and timing constraints). In this paper, we introduce a methodology for automatic co- scheduling using a proposed heuristic algorithm for hardware/software co-scheduling, ReCoS. It will be shown that the proposed algorithm provides up to an order of magnitude improvement in scheduling and execution times when compared with hardware/software co-schedulers found in related fields such as embedded systems, heterogeneous systems, and reconfigurable hardware systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231756","publicationTitle":"2007 5th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Formal Methods and Models for Codesign (MEMOCODE 2007)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 5th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Formal Methods and Models for Codesign (MEMOCODE 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4231755/4231756/04231792.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MEMCOD.2007.371229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MEMCOD.2007.371229","startPage":"159","endPage":"168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Methodology for Automating Co-Scheduling for Reconfigurable Computing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May 30 2007-June 2 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231792/","displayDocTitle":"A Methodology for Automating Co-Scheduling for Reconfigurable Computing Systems","htmlLink":"/document/4231792/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 May-2 June 2007","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10355358","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"May-June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Methodology for Automating Co-Scheduling for Reconfigurable Computing Systems","confLoc":"Nice, France","sourcePdf":"MEMCOD-00-36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086748S","chronDate":"May 30 2007-June 2 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4231755","isNumber":"4231756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4231755","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4231756","articleId":"4231792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4231826,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Graph's robustness is quantified with the node and the link connectivity, two topological metrics that give the number of nodes and links that have to be removed in order to disconnect a graph. The algebraic connectivity, i.e. the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, is a spectral property of a graph, which is an important parameter in the analysis of various robustness-related problems. In this paper we study the relationship between the proposed metrics in three well-known complex network models: the random graph of Erdos-Renyi, the small-world graph of Watts-Strogatz and the scale-free graph of Barabasi-Albert. From (Fielder, 1973) it is known that the algebraic connectivity is a lower bound on both the node and the link connectivity. Through extensive simulations with the three complex network models, we show that the algebraic connectivity is not trivially connected to graph's robustness to node and link failures. Furthermore, we show that the tightness of this lower bound is very dependent on the considered complex network model.","doi":"10.1109/NGI.2007.371203","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Next Generation Internet Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4231800/4231801/04231826.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NGI.2007.371203","publicationTitle":"2007 Next Generation Internet Networks","startPage":"96","endPage":"102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the relationship between the algebraic connectivity and graph's robustness to node and link failures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"On the relationship between the algebraic connectivity and graph's robustness to node and link failures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231826/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4231826/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9693469","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the relationship between the algebraic connectivity and graph's robustness to node and link failures","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"NGI-00-25.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067668S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4231800","isNumber":"4231801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4231800","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4231801","articleId":"4231826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4231842,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communications, Optics & Materials, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405982500"},{"name":"Villy B.

In contrast to typical rule-based systems encountered in fuzzy modeling, the underlying principle exploited here is to consider a two-phase development of fuzzy models. First, we build a standard regression model which could be treated as a preliminary construct capturing the linear part of the data and in this way forming a backbone of the entire construct. Next, all modeling discrepancies are compensated by a collection of rules that become attached to the regions of the input space where the error is localized. The incremental model is constructed by building a collection of information granules through some specialized fuzzy clustering, called context-based (conditional) fuzzy C-means that is guided by the distribution of error of the linear part of the model. The architecture of the model is discussed along with the major algorithmic phases of its development. In particular, the issue of granularity of fuzzy sets of context and induced clusters is discussed \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">vis-a-vis</i>\n the performance of the model.

In order to identify the most influential fuzzy rules induced from the SVM learning, two novel indexes for fuzzy rule ranking are proposed and named as alpha-values and omega-values of fuzzy rules in this paper. The alpha-values are defined as the Lagrangian multipliers of the L2-SVM and adopted to evaluate the output contribution of fuzzy rules, while the omega-values are developed by considering both the rule base structure and the output contribution of fuzzy rules. As a prototype-based classifier, the L2-SVM-based fuzzy classifier evades the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional space in the sense that the number of support vectors, which equals the number of induced fuzzy rules, is not related to the dimensionality. Experimental results on high-dimensional benchmark problems have shown that by using the proposed scheme the most influential fuzzy rules can be effectively induced and selected, and at the same time feature ranking results can also be obtained to construct parsimonious fuzzy classifiers with better generalization performance than the well-known algorithms in literature.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Support vector machine classification","Fuzzy systems","Kernel","Gallium nitride","Prototypes","Power system modeling","Machine learning","Lagrangian functions","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","pattern classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["L2-SVM","fuzzy classifiers","high-dimensional space","automatic model selection","fuzzy rule ranking","L2-support vector machine","feature ranking","alpha-values","Lagrangian multipliers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Feature ranking","fuzzy classifier","L2-support vector machine (L2-SVM)","prototype-based classifier","rule induction","rule ranking"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.882464","startPage":"398","endPage":"409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/4231848/04231867.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.882464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructing L2-SVM-Based Fuzzy Classifiers in High-Dimensional Space With Automatic Model Selection and Fuzzy Rule Ranking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Constructing L2-SVM-Based Fuzzy Classifiers in High-Dimensional Space With Automatic Model Selection and Fuzzy Rule Ranking","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9591391","publicationDate":"June 2007","volume":"15","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4231867/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructing L2-SVM-Based Fuzzy Classifiers in High-Dimensional Space With Automatic Model Selection and Fuzzy Rule Ranking","sourcePdf":"15tfuzz03-szhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090897S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"4231848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"4231848","articleId":"4231867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4231868,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuo Tanaka","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent Systems, University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4231848/4231868/4231868-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kazuo Tanaka (S'87\u2013M'91) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan, in 1985 and 1987, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in systems science from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 1990.","He is currently a Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Intelligent Systems at The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan.

This paper presents a descriptor system approach to fuzzy control system design using fuzzy Lyapunov functions. The design conditions are still cast in terms of LMIs but the proposed approach takes advantage of the redundancy of descriptor systems to reduce the number of LMI conditions which leads to less computational requirement. To obtain relaxed LMI conditions, new types of fuzzy controller and fuzzy Lyapunov function are proposed. A salient feature of the LMI conditions derived in this paper is to relate the feasibility of the LMIs to the switching speed of each linear subsystem (to be exact, to the lower bounds of time derivatives of membership functions). To illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach, two design examples are provided. The first example shows that the LMI conditions based on the fuzzy Lyapunov function are less conservative than those based on a common (standard) Lyapunov function. The second example illustrates the utility of the fuzzy Lyapunov function approach in comparison with a piecewise Lyapunov function approach.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.880005","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/91/4231848/04231868.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.880005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231848","startPage":"333","endPage":"341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Descriptor System Approach to Fuzzy Control System Design via Fuzzy Lyapunov Functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Descriptor System Approach to Fuzzy Control System Design via Fuzzy Lyapunov Functions","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231868/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591392","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4231868/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Descriptor System Approach to Fuzzy Control System Design via Fuzzy Lyapunov Functions","sourcePdf":"15tfuzz03-tanaka.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079676S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"4231848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"274","xplore-issue":"4231848","articleId":"4231868","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4231871,"authors":[{"name":"Huai-Ning Wu","affiliation":["School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4231848/4231871/4231871-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huai-Ning Wu was born in Anhui, China, on November 15, 1972.

A new method for the delay-dependent stability analysis and stabilization is suggested, which is less conservative than other existing ones. First, based on a fuzzy Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF), a delay-dependent stability criterion is derived for the open-loop fuzzy systems. In the derivation process, some free fuzzy weighting matrices are introduced to express the relationships among the terms of the system equation, and among the terms in the Leibniz-Newton formula. Then, a delay-dependent stabilization condition based on the so-called parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme is worked out for the closed-loop fuzzy systems. The proposed stability criterion and stabilization condition are represented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and compared with the existing ones via two examples.

The fine tuning of the if - then rule's parameters encoded in the structure is accomplished using evolutionary programming (EP). The proposed method interleaves both PIPE and EP optimizations. Starting with random structures and rules' parameters, it first tries to improve the hierarchical structure and then as soon as an improved structure is found, it further fine tunes the rules' parameters. It then goes back to improve the structure and the rules' parameters. This loop continues until a satisfactory solution (hierarchical TS-FS model) is found or a time limit is reached. The proposed hierarchical TS-FS is evaluated using some well known benchmark applications namely identification of nonlinear systems, prediction of the Mackey-Glass chaotic time-series and some classification problems.

The algorithm combines a greedy approach and an iterative improvement optimization approach. In phase I, it simultaneously scales down as many gates as possible to lower supply voltages. In phase II, a multiple way partitioning algorithm is applied to further refine the supply voltage assignment of gates to reduce the total power consumption. During both phases, the timing correctness of the circuit is maintained. Level converters (LCs) are adjusted correctly according to the local connectivity of the different supply voltage driven gates. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively convert the unused slack of gates into power savings. We use two of the ISPD2001 benchmarks and all of the ISCAS89 benchmarks as test cases. The 0.13-mum CMOS TSMC library is used. On average, the proposed algorithm improves the power consumption of the original design by 42.5% with a 10.6% overhead in the number of LCs. Our study shows that the key factor in achieving power saving is including the most comfortable supply voltage in the scaling process.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.898650","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4231873/04231876.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.898650","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gate Level Multiple Supply Voltage Assignment Algorithm for Power Optimization Under Timing Constraint","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4231876/","displayDocTitle":"Gate Level Multiple Supply Voltage Assignment Algorithm for Power Optimization Under Timing Constraint","volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9744213","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4231876/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gate Level Multiple Supply Voltage Assignment Algorithm for Power Optimization Under Timing Constraint","sourcePdf":"15tvlsi06-chi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096704S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4231873","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4231873","articleId":"4231876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4231881,"authors":[{"name":"Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos","affiliation":["Technology and Computer Architecture Laboratory, Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Giorgos","lastName":"Dimitrakopoulos","id":"37283462300"},{"name":"Christos Mavrokefalidis","affiliation":["Technology and Computer Architecture Laboratory, Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Mavrokefalidis","id":"37697987700"},{"name":"Kostas Galanopoulos","affiliation":["Technology and Computer Architecture Laboratory, Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Galanopoulos","id":"37660345400"},{"name":"Dimitris Nikolos","affiliation":["Technology and Computer Architecture Laboratory, Computer Engineering and Informatics Department, University of Patras, Patras, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitris","lastName":"Nikolos","id":"37273491600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"4231881","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":107},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4231881","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microprocessors","Sorting","CMOS technology","Cryptography","Hardware","Software algorithms","Circuits","Multimedia computing","Parallel processing","Software performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","CMOS integrated circuits","cryptography","microprocessor chips","multimedia systems","sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["static CMOS implementations","CMOS technology","energy-delay behavior","permutation instruction group","data rearrangements","cryptography","multimedia applications","subword permutations","media-enhanced microprocessors","sorter based permutation units"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cryptography","data-rearrangement instructions","multimedia processors","permutation units","sorting networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2007.898750","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4231873/04231881.pdf","startPage":"711","endPage":"715","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2007.898750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231873","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sorter Based Permutation Units for Media-Enhanced Microprocessors","abstract":"Single or multibit subword permutations are useful in many multimedia and cryptographic applications.

An increase in the allowable channel launch power of more than 2 dB is observed for NRZ signals, whereas, the increase for duobinary may be almost 6 dB.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2007.898768","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/68/4220744/04232427.pdf","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2007.898768","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4220744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Behavior of MLSE-EDC With Self-Phase Modulation Limitations and Various Dispersion Levels in 10.7-Gb/s NRZ and Duobinary Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232427","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July1,  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232427/","displayDocTitle":"Behavior of MLSE-EDC With Self-Phase Modulation Limitations and Various Dispersion Levels in 10.7-Gb/s NRZ and Duobinary Signals","volume":"19","issue":"13","publicationDate":"July1, 2007","accessionNumber":"9591324","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232427/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behavior of MLSE-EDC With Self-Phase Modulation Limitations and Various Dispersion Levels in 10.7-Gb/s NRZ and Duobinary Signals","sourcePdf":"19lpt13-downie.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069726S","chronDate":"July1,  2007","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"4220744","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4220744","articleId":"4232427","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4232438,"authors":[{"name":"Hyuk-Kee Sung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Hyuk-Kee","lastName":"Sung","id":"37418767600"},{"name":"Erwin K.

The MIMO channel performance is derived in terms of a new formulation of a channel matrix for modal group powers accounting, for the first time, for modal coupling. For fixed aggregate signaling rate and power budget, for uncoded bit streams, increasing the number of output detectors improves the bit error ratio (BER)-similarly to wireless MIMO. However, contrary to wireless MIMO, increasing the number of input ports actually yields a BER penalty, which is traceable to the quadratic nature of photodetection. We finally establish the feasibility of enhancing the aggregate bit rate using multiple inputs in the case that the individual single-input-single-output channels are band limited, e.g., given optical data sources each at 2 Gb/s, it is possible to attain a 12-Gb/s signaling rate over several hundreds of meters of MMF at 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-10</sup>\n BER, by utilizing six such inputs into the MIMO system, while incurring just a small average power penalty of approximately 2 dB/channel. The current model assumes strong intermodal coupling and neglects ISI influence over distances of up to hundreds of meters at gigabit rates, providing a first step in the optical MIMO analysis. On the other hand, similar scenario is practically met for shorter distances (up to 100 m) for the novel types of plastic optical fibers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data Parallelization by Optical MIMO Transmission Over Multimode Fiber With Intermodal Coupling","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2007.896812","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4232484/04232503.pdf","startPage":"1503","endPage":"1514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2007.896812","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232484","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232503","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232503/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Data Parallelization by Optical MIMO Transmission Over Multimode Fiber With Intermodal Coupling","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4232503/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591297","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data Parallelization by Optical MIMO Transmission Over Multimode Fiber With Intermodal Coupling","sourcePdf":"25jlt06-greenberg.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068439S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4232484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4232484","articleId":"4232503","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4232506,"authors":[{"name":"Kambiz Jamshidi","affiliation":["Optical Networks Research Laboratory, Electrical Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4232484/4232506/4232506-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kambiz Jamshidi (S'06\u2013M'07) was born in Tehran, Iran, on April 3, 1977.

The performances for the above systems are evaluated for two different transmission scenarios, namely, asynchronous and slot-level synchronous transmitters. Performance evaluation includes different sources of degradation such as multiple-access interference, noise due to optical amplification, shot noise, and thermal noise. In obtaining the performance, the mean and variance of the received signal in each of the above techniques are derived, and bit error rate is obtained using Gaussian approximation. In general, it is shown that TPA receivers are superior in performance with respect to SPA receivers when the receiver employs a much slower photodetector in comparison with the laser's transmitted pulse duration. This, indeed, is the reason behind the choice of nonlinear receivers, such as TPA, in most spectral-phase-encoded optical CDMA systems.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2007.896789","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4232484/04232506.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2007.896789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232484","startPage":"1638","endPage":"1645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of Spectral-Phase-Encoded Optical CDMA System Using Two-Photon-Absorption Receiver Structure for Asynchronous and Slot-Level Synchronous Transmitters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232506","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of Spectral-Phase-Encoded Optical CDMA System Using Two-Photon-Absorption Receiver Structure for Asynchronous and Slot-Level Synchronous Transmitters","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232506/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591300","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4232506/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of Spectral-Phase-Encoded Optical CDMA System Using Two-Photon-Absorption Receiver Structure for Asynchronous and Slot-Level Synchronous Transmitters","sourcePdf":"25jlt06-jamshidi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073346S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4232484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4232484","articleId":"4232506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4232507,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These signals need to be demultiplexed, preferably in the optical domain, to avoid loss and noise due to optical-to-electrical conversion. However, it is challenging to optically isolate signals at subgigahertz range due to the need for very narrow optical bandpass filters with high selectivity and low insertion loss and distortion. We developed such a novel subpicometer all-optical bandpass filter by creating a resonance cavity using two closely matched fiber Bragg gratings. This filter has a bandwidth of 120 MHz at -3 dB, 360 MHz at -10 dB, and 1.5 GHz at -20 dB. Experimental results show that this filter optically separates two RF signals spaced as close as 50 MHz without significant distortion. This paper analytically and experimentally investigates the scenario when this filter was used with 2.4-GHz (wireless local area network) and 900-MHz (cellular wireless) radio signals. The bit-error rate of the underlying baseband data is related to the linearity and isolation of the filter.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All-Optical Demultiplexing of WLAN and Cellular CDMA Radio Signals","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2007.896767","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4232484/04232509.pdf","startPage":"1401","endPage":"1409","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2007.896767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232484","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232509","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232509/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"All-Optical Demultiplexing of WLAN and Cellular CDMA Radio Signals","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4232509/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591303","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All-Optical Demultiplexing of WLAN and Cellular CDMA Radio Signals","sourcePdf":"25jlt06-kosek.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067946S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4232484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4232484","articleId":"4232509","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4232510,"authors":[{"name":"Athanasios Laliotis","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Imperial College London, London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4232484/4232510/4232510-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Athanasios Laliotis received the B.Sc. degree in physics from the University of Athens, Athens, Greece, in 1998, the M.S.E. degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree from Imperial College London, London, U.K., in 2005.","He was a Research Associate with the University of Paris, Paris, France.

Experimental investigations of the effects of phosphorus codoping on the amplifier spectral characteristics and fluorescence decay are also presented. We demonstrate that the shape of the erbium emission cross section, for aluminophosphosilicate amplifiers, has a minor dependence on the amount of phosphorus doping and that spectral benefits are only achieved for aluminosilicate amplifiers, albeit with low levels of erbium inversion. Laminated amplifiers, consisting of alternating layers of two compositions, are shown to display novel spectral characteristics that cannot be obtained by the use of single composition cores. Internal gain, which is demonstrated for this device, also suggests that erbium inversion can be maintained at relatively high levels. Experimental results are supported by numerical analysis, and a 20-nm bandwidth increase is observed for laminated amplifiers, with gain levels up to 1.4 dB/cm indicated, when processing conditions are optimized.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Optical amplifiers","Erbium","Optical waveguides","Optical films","Optical network units","Optical filters","Glass","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Doping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminosilicate glasses","doping","erbium","fluorescence","integrated optics","laminates","optical multilayers","phosphorus","phosphosilicate glasses","sol-gel processing","solid lasers","waveguide lasers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayered waveguides","gain bandwidth","integrated amplifiers","laminated waveguides","sol-gel amplifiers","phosphorus codoping","fluorescence decay","erbium emission cross section","aluminophosphosilicate amplifiers","aluminosilicate amplifiers","erbium inversion","Al2O3-SiO2:Er,P - System","Al2O3-P2O5-SiO2:Er,P - System"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Er-doping","optical amplifier","sol\u2013gel","thin films"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JLT.2007.895561","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4232484/04232510.pdf","startPage":"1613","endPage":"1620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2007.895561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilayered Waveguides for Increasing the Gain Bandwidth of Integrated Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multilayered Waveguides for Increasing the Gain Bandwidth of Integrated Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232510/","volume":"25","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232510/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9591304","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilayered Waveguides for Increasing the Gain Bandwidth of Integrated Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"25jlt06-laliotis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074364S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4232484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4232484","articleId":"4232510","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4232512,"authors":[{"name":"Christina Lim","affiliation":["ARC Special Research Centre for Ultra Broadband Information Networks (CUBIN), Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/50/4232484/4232512/4232512-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christina Lim (S'98\u2013M'00\u2013SM'06) received the B.E.

We present a systematic analysis and quantification of the third-order IMD generated due to optical components in the nonlinear optical front-end. Our proposed technique to improve the optical front-end linearity is by the removal of the optical components that contribute most to the third-order IMD in the RF domain. We experimentally demonstrated the proposed technique with two- and three-tone tests and showed more than 9-dB improvement in the overall carrier-to-IMD ratio. The proposed technique was also investigated via simulation analysis for a larger number of radio channels and showed an IMD suppression of >10 dB. In addition, the proposed technique is not only able to improve the carrier-to-interference of the radio signals but also to enable simultaneous baseband transmission, thereby facilitating the merging of millimeter-wave fiber-radio systems with other wired-access infrastructure. We present a detailed investigation and characterization of this technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intermodulation Distortion Improvement for Fiber\u2013Radio Applications Incorporating OSSB+C Modulation in an Optical Integrated-Access Environment","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2007.896814","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4232484/04232512.pdf","startPage":"1602","endPage":"1612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2007.896814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232484","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232512/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Intermodulation Distortion Improvement for Fiber\u2013Radio Applications Incorporating OSSB+C Modulation in an Optical Integrated-Access Environment","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4232512/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591306","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intermodulation Distortion Improvement for Fiber\u2013Radio Applications Incorporating OSSB+C Modulation in an Optical Integrated-Access Environment","sourcePdf":"25jlt06-lim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116832S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4232484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4232484","articleId":"4232512","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4232514,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Receivers with interferometric direct detection can be used to detect arbitrary modulation formats with differentially encoded phases as differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) and differentially phase-encoded star-shaped quadrature amplitude modulation (Star QAM). In this paper, two novel 16-ary modulation formats, which are the 16 DPSK and the Star 16 QAM (ASK-8 DPSK), are characterized for optical transmission for the first time. To be able to identify clear performance tendencies for high-order optical modulation, the novel formats are compared to a wide range of already investigated formats by conducting comprehensive calculations in a uniform simulation environment. The influence of different transmitter structures and decision schemes is considered, and all the systems are characterized with respect to the optical signal-to-noise ratio requirements, dispersion tolerance, and self-phase-modulation (SPM) performance for nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) and RZ pulse shapes. Moreover, an inherent problem of Star QAM transmission concerning SPM is illustrated, and compensation techniques are examined. The results give a substantial insight into the properties of high-order optical modulation formats.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2007.896810","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4232484/04232520.pdf","startPage":"1515","endPage":"1530","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2007.896810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical Systems With High-Order DPSK and Star QAM Modulation Based on Interferometric Direct Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232520/","displayDocTitle":"Optical Systems With High-Order DPSK and Star QAM Modulation Based on Interferometric Direct Detection","volume":"25","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591312","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232520/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Systems With High-Order DPSK and Star QAM Modulation Based on Interferometric Direct Detection","sourcePdf":"25jlt06-seimetz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089619S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4232484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"4232484","articleId":"4232520","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4232521,"authors":[{"name":"Tomohiro Taniguchi","affiliation":["18F-WN, NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Tomohiro Taniguchi received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in precision engineering from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 2000 and 2002, respectively.","Since 2002, he has been with NTT Laboratories, Chiba, Japan, and has been engaged in research on optical-access systems, mainly related to optical heterodyne technique and radio-on-fiber transmission.","Mr. Taniguchi is a member of the Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE), Japan."]},"firstName":"Tomohiro","lastName":"Taniguchi","id":"37273806700"},{"name":"Naoya Sakurai","affiliation":["18F-WN, NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, Chiba, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Naoya Sakurai received the B.E. degree in applied electronics engineering from the University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo, Japan, in 1981.","He was with NTT Laboratories in 1981 and was engaged in research on the high-definition television transmission systems.

This work paves the way for integrating flexible analog decoders dealing with frame lengths over thousands of bits. The algorithm benefits from a partially continuous exchange of extrinsic information to improve decoding speed and correction performance. The proposed algorithm and architecture are applied to design an analog decoder for double-binary codes. Taking full advantage of multiple slice codes, the on-chip area is shown to be reduced by ten when compared to a conventional fully parallelized analog slice turbo decoder. The reconfigurable analog core area for frames of 40 bits up to 2432 bits is 37 nm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n in a 0.25-mum BiCMOS process.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4232573/","accessionNumber":"9591251","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Iterative Analog Turbo Decoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Iterative Analog Turbo Decoding","sourcePdf":"54tcsi06-arzel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066606S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4232572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4232572","articleId":"4232573","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4232574,"authors":[{"name":"Tianping Chen","affiliation":["Laboratory of Nonlinear Mathematics Science, Institute of Mathematics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4232572/4232574/4232574-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tianping Chen is a Professor in the Department of Mathematics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

Of these applications, the class-E amplifier has been given particular attention, since it is theoretically a 100%-efficient switched circuit that has been successfully demonstrated in applications such as ballasts, converters, frequency multipliers, and communication amplifiers at frequencies as high as 10 GHz. However, with increasing power or frequency, nonlinearities become extremely important, for instance, in order to achieve actual class-E operation and even to avoid destruction of the switching device. In this paper, a new method for determining the steady-state response of nonlinear circuits containing ideal switches is proposed. While the method is more general, the description is based on the class-E amplifier because of its inherent interest. The method is based on a time-domain Gear discretization of the circuit equations. A technique for determining the initial samples of the discretized equation of each topology is developed, based on the fact that state variables are constant during switching. Finally, assuming a periodic steady-state, a single algebraic system of nonlinear equations is obtained in which the unknowns are the samples of the control variable of the nonlinearity in the whole signal period. To validate the method described, a comparison with PSpice simulations is provided. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Steady-state","Nonlinear equations","Switched circuits","Frequency conversion","Power electronics","Electronic ballasts","Switching converters","Communication switching","Nonlinear circuits","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","discrete time systems","nonlinear network analysis","switched networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSpice simulations","nonlinear equations","time-domain Gear discretization","nonlinear circuits","communication amplifiers","frequency multipliers","switched circuits","nonlinear class-E amplifiers","steady-state analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circuit analysis","class-E","discrete-time","nonlinear circuits","steady state","switched circuits"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2007.896741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4232572/04232581.pdf","startPage":"1358","endPage":"1366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2007.896741","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Discrete-Time Technique for the Steady-State Analysis of Nonlinear Class-E Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Discrete-Time Technique for the Steady-State Analysis of Nonlinear Class-E Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232581/","volume":"54","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9591256","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Discrete-Time Technique for the Steady-State Analysis of Nonlinear Class-E Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"54tcsi06-delaguilalopez.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035813S","chronDate":"June  2007","isNumber":"4232572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4232581","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":4232582,"authors":[{"name":"Jen-Lin Fan","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4232572/4232582/4232582-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jen-Lin Fan was born in Hsin-Chu, Taiwan, R.O.C.

For a switched-capacitor (SC) pipeline stage, by splitting its input sampling capacitor, a random sequence can be injected into the ADC's signal path, and then calibration data can be extracted from the ADC's digital output without interrupting its normal conversion operation. Using an input-dependent scheme to generate the calibration random sequence, no additional signal range is required to accommodate the extra calibration signal. Furthermore, using random choppers to scramble signal can ensure that all necessary calibration data can be collected within a given time regardless of input conditions, resulting in a more robust ADC. A split-channel ADC architecture is proposed to reduce the calibration time. The split-channel ADC consists of two A/D channels that receive the same analog input but employ different random sequences for calibration. The calibration time can be greatly reduced by comparing the digital outputs from both channels and then removing the embedded perturbations before extracting the calibration data. The proposed calibration techniques are analyzed by using both theoretical formulation and system-level simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4232582/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9744207","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Robust and Fast Digital Background Calibration Technique for Pipelined ADCs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust and Fast Digital Background Calibration Technique for Pipelined ADCs","sourcePdf":"54tcsi06-fan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067162S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4232572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4232572","articleId":"4232582","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4232583,"authors":[{"name":"David W.

The VLSI implementation is based on the lifting scheme for wavelet computation using the symmlet4 basis with quantized coefficients and integer fixed-point data precision to minimize hardware demands. The proposed design is driven by the need to compress neural signals recorded with high-density microelectrode arrays implanted in the cortex prior to data telemetry. Our results indicate that signal integrity is not compromised by quantization down to 5-bit filter coefficient and 10-bit data precision at intermediate stages. Furthermore, results from analog simulation and modeling show that a hardware-minimized computational core executing filter steps sequentially is advantageous over the pipeline approach commonly used in DWT implementations. The design is compared to that of a B-spline approach that minimizes the number of multipliers at the expense of increasing the number of adders. The performance demonstrates that in vivo real-time DWT computation is feasible prior to data telemetry, permitting large savings in bandwidth requirements and communication costs given the severe limitations on size, energy consumption and power dissipation of an implantable device.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4232572/04232594.pdf","startPage":"1266","endPage":"1278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Scalable Wavelet Transform VLSI Architecture for Real-Time Signal Processing in High-Density Intra-Cortical Implants","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2007.897726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2007.897726","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232594","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232594/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable Wavelet Transform VLSI Architecture for Real-Time Signal Processing in High-Density Intra-Cortical Implants","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591262","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4232594/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable Wavelet Transform VLSI Architecture for Real-Time Signal Processing in High-Density Intra-Cortical Implants","sourcePdf":"54tcsi06-oweiss.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077605S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4232572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4232572","articleId":"4232594","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4232595,"authors":[{"name":"Riyaz A.

The principal operation of both peaking networks is described qualitatively in time-domain where the inherent bandwidth superiority of SH peaking is revealed. With the help of triple resonance concept, a rigorous and insightful analysis is then given in frequency domain. Analytical equations applicable to both networks have been derived to enable the proper inductance selection and to quantify the bandwidth advantage of SH peaking. In addition, various frequency characteristics of the networks are discussed through the investigation of their triple resonant frequency locations. This is followed by detailed analysis on the important nonidealities due to transistor's gate resistance and inductors' losses. The effectiveness of theoretical analysis is demonstrated via design and simulation of SHCA and HSCA with identical number of stages, gain and power consumption. The results show good agreement between theoretical analysis and simulation where the SHCA outperforms its HS counterpart in bandwidth while other performances are practically identical. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Broadband amplifiers","Bandwidth","Analytical models","Content addressable storage","Time domain analysis","Resonance","Frequency domain analysis","Equations","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascade networks","CMOS integrated circuits","frequency-domain analysis","integrated circuit design","time-domain analysis","wideband amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transistors gate resistance","frequency domain","time-domain","triple-resonance interstage peaking","wide-band cascaded CMOS amplifiers design","performance analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bandwidth enhancement technique","CMOS amplifier","shunt peaking","wide-band amplifier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2007.897766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4232572/04232602.pdf","startPage":"1189","endPage":"1203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232572","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2007.897766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis and Design of Triple-Resonance Interstage Peaking for Wide-Band Cascaded CMOS Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232602","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis and Design of Triple-Resonance Interstage Peaking for Wide-Band Cascaded CMOS Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232602/","volume":"54","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9591269","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis and Design of Triple-Resonance Interstage Peaking for Wide-Band Cascaded CMOS Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"54tcsi06-worapishet.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032645S","chronDate":"June  2007","isNumber":"4232572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"12","articleId":"4232602","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":4232612,"authors":[{"name":"Ilaria Catapano","affiliation":["Istituto per il Rilevamento Elettromagnetico dellAmbiente, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (IREA-CNR), Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Ilaria","lastName":"Catapano","id":"37398874100"},{"name":"Lorenzo Crocco","affiliation":["Istituto per il Rilevamento Elettromagnetico dellAmbiente, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (IREA-CNR), Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Crocco","id":"37273742600"},{"name":"Michele D'Urso","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni, Universita Federico II di Napoli, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"D'Urso","id":"37273727000"},{"name":"Tommaso Isernia","affiliation":["DIMET, Universit\u00e1 Mediterranea di Reggio Calabria, Reggio Calabria, Italy"],"firstName":"Tommaso","lastName":"Isernia","id":"37272204500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"4232612","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":321},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"Starting from the concept of \"degree of non-linearity\" of the relationship amongst unknown parameters and scattered fields, we discuss how knowledge of the geometrical features of the targets favorably affects the solution of inverse scattering problems. The same concept is also exploited to optimize the contrast source-extended Born (CS-EB) model, resulting in the optimized CS-EB (O-CS-EB) inversion approach, which remarkably reduces false solutions occurrence. Then, a two-steps approach is proposed as a reliable and effective inversion strategy. The first step consists in retrieving the shape of the targets using the linear sampling method, while in the second step, the estimated shapes and the O-CS-EB are exploited to reconstruct the permittivity profile. The approach has been tested against experimental data, showing that very accurate reconstructions are achieved from monochromatic data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverse problems","Electromagnetic scattering","Image reconstruction","Shape","Permittivity","Sampling methods","Testing","Optimization methods","Solid modeling","Scattering parameters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","estimation theory","image reconstruction","inverse problems","permittivity","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["support estimation","2D inverse scattering problems","scattered fields","geometrical features","contrast source-extended Born model","linear sampling","permittivity profile"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Contrast source-extended Born (CS-EB)","electromagnetic inverse scattering problems","shape reconstruction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.898647","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4231307/04232612.pdf","startPage":"1895","endPage":"1899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.898647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Effect of Support Estimation and of a New Model in 2-D Inverse Scattering Problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232612","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Effect of Support Estimation and of a New Model in 2-D Inverse Scattering Problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232612/","volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232612/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9591209","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Effect of Support Estimation and of a New Model in 2-D Inverse Scattering Problems","sourcePdf":"55tap06-catapano-cr-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068309S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4231307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4231307","articleId":"4232612","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4232615,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Yuk Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4231307/4232615/4232615-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chi-Yuk Chiu (S'01\u2013M'05) received both the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.","He is currently a Research Associate at the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

It is found that isolations of more than -20 dB can be achieved between two parallel individual planar inverted-F antennas (PIFAs) sharing a common ground plane, with inter-antenna spacing (center to center) of 0.116 lambda\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</sub>\n and ground plane size 0.331lambda\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">o</sub>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n. At 2.31 GHz it is demonstrated that this translates into an edge to edge separation between antennas of just 10 mm. Similarly the structure can be applied to reduce mutual coupling between three or four radiating elements. In addition the mutual coupling between half wavelength patches and monopoles can also be reduced with the aid of the proposed ground plane structure. Results of parametric studies are also given in this paper. Both simulation and measurement results are used to confirm the suppression of mutual coupling between closely-packed antenna elements with our slitted ground plane.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.898618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4231307/04232615.pdf","startPage":"1732","endPage":"1738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.898618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of Mutual Coupling Between Closely-Packed Antenna Elements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232615/","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Mutual Coupling Between Closely-Packed Antenna Elements","volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591212","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232615/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Mutual Coupling Between Closely-Packed Antenna Elements","sourcePdf":"55tap06-chiu-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060693S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4231307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"386","xplore-issue":"4231307","articleId":"4232615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4232636,"authors":[{"name":"Sungtek Kahng","affiliation":["University of Incheon, Dohwa-dong, Nam-gu, Incheon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Sungtek","lastName":"Kahng","id":"37312091200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"4232636","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"The genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized to optimize the sizes and positions of slits on the printed circuit board power-bus to reduce specified impedance peaks that are cavity resonance in the structure.

This paper focuses on a mushroom-type EBG structure, although the design is applicable to various EBG profiles. The patch antenna is modeled as a half-wavelength resonator of an EBG-loaded microstrip transmission line. Through a full-wave eigenmode analysis of a microstrip line on an EBG structure, it is found that the resonant patch will not see a high-impedance surface (HIS), but rather it is coupled to the EBG structure as an open cavity resonator. Due to strong near-field coupling, the propagation characteristics including the bandgap zones are very different with or without the patch cover. The use of an EBG structure as a bulk material for antennas is seen inappropriate. The EBG surface is found to have the effect of reducing the patch resonant length and bandwidth. A prototype of a microstrip line proximity fed to a patch antenna is fabricated and tested to verify the analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.898633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4231307/04232640.pdf","startPage":"1691","endPage":"1697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.898633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation Characteristics of a Microstrip Patch Over an Electromagnetic Bandgap Surface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232640/","displayDocTitle":"Radiation Characteristics of a Microstrip Patch Over an Electromagnetic Bandgap Surface","volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591223","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232640/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation Characteristics of a Microstrip Patch Over an Electromagnetic Bandgap Surface","sourcePdf":"55tap06-liang-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063596S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4231307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4231307","articleId":"4232640","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4232643,"authors":[{"name":"Gaetano Marrocco","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Informatica, Sistemi e Produzione, Universit\u00e0 di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/4231307/4232643/4232643-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gaetano Marrocco (M'98) received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering and the Ph.D. degree in applied electromagnetics from the University of L'Aquila, Italy, in 1994 and 1998, respectively.","Since 1997, he has been a Researcher at the University of Rome \u201cTor Vergata,\u201d Rome, where he currently teaches Antenna Design and Bioelectromagnetics.

A propagation engineer desires to have a numerical propagator that calculates the radiowave path loss, without going into details and/or having a deep knowledge of the propagation phenomena, between any two points specified on a digital map of the area of interest. Since a generally applicable, all-purpose propagation prediction method has not developed yet one has to understand validity and accuracy ranges, and the limitations of available prediction models and tools; this certainly requires, to some extent, the physical insight of the propagation problem at hand. This article aims to summarize groundwave propagation modeling and numerical simulation strategies, and to review some of the virtual tools, introduced recently.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4231310/04232654.pdf","startPage":"1591","endPage":"1598","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.897256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.897256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231310","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232654","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Groundwave Modeling and Simulation Strategies and Path Loss Prediction Virtual Tools","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Electromagnetic propagation","Atmospheric modeling","Propagation losses","Radio transmitters","Receivers","Electromagnetic scattering","Atmosphere","Radio communication","Radar scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric electromagnetic wave propagation","electromagnetic wave scattering","numerical analysis","radar","radiocommunication","radiowave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["groundwave propagation modeling","numerical simulation strategies","path loss prediction","virtual tools","electromagnetic wave scattering","radio communication","radar system","digital mapping","all-purpose propagation prediction method","inhomogeneous atmosphere","nonflat terrain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analytical methods","atmospheric refractivity effects","electromagnetic wave propagation","finite-difference time- domain (FDTD)","groundwaves","Matlab","method of moments (MoM)","mixed-path propagation","non-flat terrain modeling","numerical methods","numerical simulator","parabolic equation method","ray-mode approximations","short pulse propagation","split- step PE (SSPE)","surface impedance","surface waves","transmission line matrix (TLM)","virtual tools","wave scattering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232654/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Groundwave Modeling and Simulation Strategies and Path Loss Prediction Virtual Tools","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4232654/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591246","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Groundwave Modeling and Simulation Strategies and Path Loss Prediction Virtual Tools","sourcePdf":"55tap06-sevgi-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108036S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4231310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4231310","articleId":"4232654","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4232655,"authors":[{"name":"Jamesina J.

The following topical areas are discussed: long-range two-dimensional propagation, lightning sources and radiation, global propagation, Schumann resonances, hypothesized pre-seismic lithosphere sources and radiation, detection of deep underground resource formations, and remote sensing of localized ionospheric anomalies.

Typically, the synthesis of a contoured beam footprint using a planar 2D array is difficult because of the inherently large number of degrees of freedom involved (in general, the amplitude and phase of each element must be determined). We make use of a parallel GA tool in this study to compensate for this aspect of the design problem. The algorithm essentially compares a desired pattern envelope with that of trial arrays, and quantifies the effectiveness or desirability of each test case via a fitness function. The GA uses this information to rank and select subsequent arrays over a given number of generations via the conventional stochastic operators, i.e., selection, crossover, and mutation. Each fitness evaluation of a trial pattern is done on a node of the aerospace fellowship cluster supercomputer, which increases the speed of the algorithm linearly with the number of nodes. Because of the continuous nature of the parameters for this optimization problem, a real parameter encoding scheme is employed for the GA chromosome in order to avoid the quantization errors associated with a binary representation. A benchmark 10 times 10 (100) element array is employed, and various results of optimized coverage patterns are shown herein to illustrate the effectiveness and validity of the technique.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2007.898601","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/4231307/04232657.pdf","startPage":"1745","endPage":"1753","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2007.898601","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4231307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Genetic-Algorithm Optimization of Shaped Beam Coverage Areas Using Planar 2-D Phased Arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232657/","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Genetic-Algorithm Optimization of Shaped Beam Coverage Areas Using Planar 2-D Phased Arrays","volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591231","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232657/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Genetic-Algorithm Optimization of Shaped Beam Coverage Areas Using Planar 2-D Phased Arrays","sourcePdf":"55tap06-villegas-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063981S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"4231307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"4231307","articleId":"4232657","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4232669,"authors":[{"name":"Stephanie M.

Conventional power loading algorithms for OFDM are based on forward channel state information (CSI) knowledge in the transmitter provided by a dedicated feedback link from the receiver. In this paper, we propose a feedback scheme where instead of providing the transmitter with forward-link CSI we directly send the received pilots back to the transmitter. The transmitter extracts the forward-link CSI, and compensates both the amplitude and the phase of the channel for each tone before transmitting the OFDM symbol, a process also known as pre-equalization. Although the proposed scheme is sub-optimum in terms of power loading, we show that our feedback technique converts the Rayleigh fading channel into a flat channel and also simplifies the receiver.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.19","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232678.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","startPage":"48","endPage":"51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot Feedback Equalization for Time Varying OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot Feedback Equalization for Time Varying OFDM Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232678/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9701756","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4232678/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot Feedback Equalization for Time Varying OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"M03-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062485S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4232679,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Yazdan-Panah","firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Yazdan-Panah","id":"38273219500"},{"name":"Behrang Nosrat Makouei","firstName":"Behrang Nosrat","lastName":"Makouei","id":"37692009200"},{"name":"Rodney G.

Two relaxation methods are then utilized to relax the maximum likelihood (ML) detection problem into convex quadratic programming (QP) problems. To further reduce computational complexity, the QP problems are solved by limiting the search to a 2-dimensional subspace.

However, the Franks windowing or SOCW windowing shows better BER performance when the roll-off factor approaches one.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact BER Analysis for a Receiver Windowing OFDM System over Frequency Selective Rayleigh Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.54","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232713.pdf","startPage":"188","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232713","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232713/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Exact BER Analysis for a Receiver Windowing OFDM System over Frequency Selective Rayleigh Fading Channels","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232713/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9701786","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact BER Analysis for a Receiver Windowing OFDM System over Frequency Selective Rayleigh Fading Channels","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"M11-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054541S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232713","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4232714,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Tan","id":"37271340300"},{"name":"Norman C.

The analytical expression can be used to investigate the effect of several channel parameters, including mean delay spread and maximum Doppler spread, on the system BER performance.

The detector is further integrated with two iterative equalizers that use either iterative turbo equalization or probabilistic data association to provide additional performance gains. Simulated bit-error rate performance results for various antenna configurations illustrate that the MIMO integration can provide dramatic performance gains when compared to the traditional single-antenna GSM system.

Our goal is to design a robust precoder that minimizes the total transmitted power required to satisfy the users' QoS constraints for all channels within a specified uncertainty region around the estimate of each user's channel. Unfortunately, this design problem is computationally intractable, but we will make progress by deriving three conservative design approaches that yield convex and computationally-efficient restrictions of the original design problem. The three approaches yield semidefinite program (SDP) formulations that offer different trade-offs between the degree of conservatism and the size of the SDP.

The transmitter exploits the knowledge of the transmit and receive correlation matrices, while the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be unknown. The latter assumption is especially important for the case of time-varying channels, for which the instantaneous CSI is typically unavailable at the transmitter. It is also assumed that the receiver has a precise knowledge of the instantaneous CSI. The precoder operates along with an orthogonal space-time block code (OSTBC) and aims at minimizing the Chernoff bound on the symbol error rate (SER). We show that for some particular correlation scenarios, the closed-form precoder designs can be obtained. Our simulations demonstrate the advantages of the proposed preceding techniques.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoder Design for Space-Time Coded MIMO Systems with Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.88","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232747.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.88","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232747","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Precoder Design for Space-Time Coded MIMO Systems with Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232747/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9701817","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoder Design for Space-Time Coded MIMO Systems with Correlated Rayleigh Fading Channels","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"M19-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058793S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4232748,"authors":[{"name":"Malihe Ahmadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"firstName":"Malihe","lastName":"Ahmadi","id":"37692784600"},{"name":"Aryan Saadat Mehr","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada"],"firstName":"Aryan Saadat","lastName":"Mehr","id":"37326842700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1021-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1020-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4232748","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Maximum likelihood decoding","Fading","Transmitters","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","AWGN","Channel state information","Detectors","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","differential detection","maximum likelihood estimation","probability","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-symbol differential detection","V-BLAST","sphere decoding","Rayleigh fading channels","maximum-likelihood estimator","N-1 data symbols"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232748","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.89","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","abstract":"Multiple-symbol differential detection (MSDD) has been used to detect transmitted data over Rayleigh fading channels without channel state information by jointly processing groups of N received symbols to detect N-1 data symbols.

How to obtain robust template parameters efficiently in order to guarantee reliable operation is an important issue for the design of analogue CNN circuits. This paper starts from the assumption that digital DT-CNN emulation implemented on FPGA can be used to bridge the implementation gap between CNN system description and analogue realization. In this paper, a digital emulation methodology is described in detail for quickly obtaining the robust templates for analogue CNN system performing the specific operation. And the erroneous analogue CNN chip is simulated by digital DT-CNN implementation on FPGA with network-on-chip approach. The simulation results show that 290 robust templates are generated from 14641 test templates by using this digital emulation methodology and those robust templates can guarantee the correct specific operation with truncating the internal data from full-precision 21 bits (L_max) to 7 bits (L_min).","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232773.pdf","startPage":"433","endPage":"436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.114","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Emulation of Analogue CNN System on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital Emulation of Analogue CNN System on FPGA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232773/","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4232773/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9701838","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Emulation of Analogue CNN System on FPGA","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"M25-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07803S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232773","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4232774,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz Talaska","affiliation":["Faculty of Telecommunication and Electrical Engineering, University of Technology and Life Sciences, Bydgoszcz, Poland"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Talaska","id":"37294952800"},{"name":"Rafal Dlugosz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada","Institute of Microtechnology, University of Neuch\u00e2tel, Neuchatel, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Rafal","lastName":"Dlugosz","id":"37298868900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1021-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1020-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4232774","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS technology","Euclidean distance","Circuits","Neural networks","Neurons","Frequency","Medical services","Biomedical equipment","Current measurement","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","neural nets","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Euclidean distance calculation","current mode EDC circuit","Kohonen's neural network","CMOS 0.18 mum technology","power dissipation","size 0.18 mum","power 15 muW","voltage 1.5 V","frequency 20 MHz","current 300 nA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232774","abstract":"In this paper we present analog current mode Euclidean distance calculation (EDC) block, which calculates the distance between two current vectors. The proposed circuit is an important part of the CMOS-implemented Kohonen's neural network (KNN) designed for medical applications. The input data vector is compared with the weights' vector in each neuron in proposed KNN. The neuron, whose weights are the closest to the input training vector becomes the winner and in the next step changes its weights. Proposed EDC block performs several operations such as: subtraction, squaring and summing of the current signals. The output current is the exact measure of the Euclidean distance.

The first algorithm, the maximum a posteriori probability-per survivor processing (MAP-PSP), employs an improved survivor branch decision technique based on the symbol by symbol MAP criterion, with a fixed delay. This delay allows future received symbols to be utilized in the decision making, resulting in a more reliable survivor branch selection than in the conventional PSP. The second one is based on a delayed mixture Kalman filtering (MKF) technique, where importance samples and weights take into account also future received symbols. Simulation results show that the MAP-PSP algorithm substantially outperforms the delayed MKF algorithm with a lower computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.122","startPage":"461","endPage":"465","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232781.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance/Complexity Comparison between MAP-PSP and Mixture Kalman Filtering for Joint Estimation and Detection of STTCs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232781/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance/Complexity Comparison between MAP-PSP and Mixture Kalman Filtering for Joint Estimation and Detection of STTCs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232781/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9701845","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance/Complexity Comparison between MAP-PSP and Mixture Kalman Filtering for Joint Estimation and Detection of STTCs","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"M27-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046479S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4232782,"authors":[{"name":"Sara Bavarian","affiliation":["Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Bavarian","id":"37296051800"},{"name":"James K.

The mines of interest produce potash, and they are at a depth of approximately 1000 meters, being relatively large, covering an area greater than 10 kilometers by 10 kilometers. A major application of vehicle positioning is in tracking ground penetrating radar. Ground penetrating radar is used to ascertain the current condition of the mine ceiling and evaluate its risk of delamination (i.e. collapse). A ground penetrating radar system is driven along a tunnel and measurements are logged. It is necessary to record position information along with the radar signal, and this can be an expensive task without a positioning system, since there are many kilometers of mine tunnels. Two possible problem solutions are proposed each using different absolute measurements. For the first case the distance to the mine walls is used. In the second case an existing wireless ethernet network furnishes the positioning system with distances from local access points. The system model is the same for both formulations and uses a state space representation. Both formulations also make use of inertial measurements such as acceleration. A particle filter, which is a recursive Bayesian technique using sequential Monte Carlo sampling, is used to estimate the state and, therefore, the position of the vehicle.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ground penetrating radar","Land vehicles","Road vehicles","Radar tracking","Delamination","Ethernet networks","State-space methods","Accelerometers","Acceleration","Particle filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","mining","mobile robots","Monte Carlo methods","navigation","sampling methods","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle positioning","underground mines","mine ceiling","ground penetrating radar system","wireless Ethernet network","state space representation","particle filter","recursive Bayesian technique","sequential Monte Carlo sampling","state estimation","position estimation"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.151","startPage":"586","endPage":"589","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232810.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Positioning in Underground Mines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Vehicle Positioning in Underground Mines","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9701874","publicationDate":"April 2007","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4232810/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle Positioning in Underground Mines","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"T33-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062749S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4232815,"authors":[{"name":"Mehtaz Sharmin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Mehtaz","lastName":"Sharmin","id":"37424545300"},{"name":"Chintha Tellambura","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Chintha","lastName":"Tellambura","id":"37281000600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1021-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1020-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4232815","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Evolutionary computation","Computational complexity","Bit error rate","Multiple access interference","Search methods","Bandwidth","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","computational complexity","error statistics","evolutionary computation","maximum likelihood detection","multiuser detection","search problems","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser detection","DS-CDMA system","synchronous direct sequence code-division multiple access system","evolutionary algorithm","search process","optimal bit-error rate performance","computational complexity","maximum-likelihood detector"]}],"abstract":"A hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm is presented in this paper for multiuser detection in a synchronous direct sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system, which explores the application of Evolutionary algorithm (EA).

At the receiver side of LAST-MUD, the mathematical expression of the signals passing through the space-code matched filters is similar to the received signals of the V-BLAST system. This similarity makes it possible to apply some advance detection schemes originally used in single user V-BLAST system to multiuser MIMO-CDMA system. Recently, the B-Chase and L-Chase detectors have been developed to improve V-BLAST system performance. In this paper, we investigate the use of these two Chase based schemes to MIMO-CDMA system. The simulation results show that the performance of the L-Chase detector is worse than LAST-MUD due to the error in noise estimation, while the B-Chase detector can achieve a better performance than LAST-MUD.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chase Based Multiuser Detection for MIMO-CDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.158","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232817.pdf","startPage":"613","endPage":"616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Chase Based Multiuser Detection for MIMO-CDMA Systems","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232817/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9701881","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chase Based Multiuser Detection for MIMO-CDMA Systems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"T35-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054361S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4232818,"authors":[{"name":"May Gomaa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"May","lastName":"Gomaa","id":"37702943000"},{"name":"Ali Ghrayeb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ghrayeb","id":"37278225300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1021-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1020-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4232818","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"abstract":"Merging layered space-time (LST) coding, which provides high data rate transmission, with space-time block coding (STBC) provides a tradeoff between transmit diversity and bandwidth efficiency in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This architecture is known as multilayered space time coding (MLSTC). In this paper, we propose a reduced complexity MMSE detector based on the Sorted QR decomposition, intended for MLSTC systems. The proposed decoder has reduced computational complexity in comparison to the group interference cancellation scheme. Our proposed decoder allows for the number of receive antennas to be less than the number of transmit antennas. Since we are dealing with a multiuser system, we wish all users to benefit from the same performance. We therefore use power allocation techniques to amplify users to the highest level of performance available and thus improving the performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232818.pdf","startPage":"617","endPage":"620","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.159","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity MMSE Detector for Multiuser Layered Space-Time Coded MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","MIMO","Decoding","Receiving antennas","Merging","Block codes","Bandwidth","Computer architecture","Computational complexity","Interference cancellation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","least mean squares methods","multiuser detection","receiving antennas","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE detector","multiuser layered space-time coded MIMO systems","space-time block coding","transmit diversity","multiple-input multiple-output systems","receive antennas","power allocation techniques","multilayered space time coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity MMSE Detector for Multiuser Layered Space-Time Coded MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232818/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9701882","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity MMSE Detector for Multiuser Layered Space-Time Coded MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"T35-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039105S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4232819,"authors":[{"name":"Pooyan Haghighat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Canada"],"firstName":"Pooyan","lastName":"Haghighat","id":"37692008700"},{"name":"Ali Ghrayeb","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ghrayeb","id":"37278225300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1021-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1020-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4232819","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Multiuser detection","Silicon carbide","Delay","Costs","Multiple access interference","Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","error statistics","interference suppression","matrix algebra","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid serial-parallel interference cancellation scheme","WCDMA systems","wideband code division multiple access uplink transmission","user configuration algorithm","bit-error-rate performance","adaptive matrix","bit-streaming pipelined multiuser detection","channel estimation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a hybrid interference cancellation scheme for wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) uplink transmission.

We study the optimal stationary randomized call admission control policy and the optimal fixed-set-partition policy. We analyze computational complexities associated with these policies. We discuss both 1) offline computation for optimally designing these policies and 2) online execution of these polices.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232822.pdf","startPage":"635","endPage":"638","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity Analysis of Optimal Stationary Call Admission Policy and Fixed Set Partitioning Policy for OVSF-CDMA Cellular Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Call admission control","Computational complexity","System performance","Statistics","Wideband","Cellular networks","Wireless networks","Multimedia systems","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","communication complexity","orthogonal codes","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complexity analysis","optimal stationary call admission control policy","fixed set partitioning policy","OVSF-CDMA Cellular Systems","call requests","orthogonal variable spreading factor codes","wideband CDMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Complexity Analysis of Optimal Stationary Call Admission Policy and Fixed Set Partitioning Policy for OVSF-CDMA Cellular Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232822/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9701885","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity Analysis of Optimal Stationary Call Admission Policy and Fixed Set Partitioning Policy for OVSF-CDMA Cellular Systems","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"T36-3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036063S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4232825,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Fobel","affiliation":["Computing and Information Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Fobel","id":"37660852500"},{"name":"Gary Grewal","affiliation":["Computing and Information Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Grewal","id":"37276420700"},{"name":"Andrew Morton","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Morton","id":"37401185600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1021-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1020-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4232825","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Hardware Acceleration to Reduce FPGA Placement Times","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232825.pdf","startPage":"647","endPage":"650","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.166","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Acceleration","Field programmable gate arrays","Iterative algorithms","Routing","Switches","Algorithm design and analysis","Integrated circuit interconnections","Logic arrays","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","iterative methods","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA placement time","field programmable gate array","hardware-accelerated iterative-improvement algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232825","abstract":"Placement is one of the most time-consuming processes in automatically synthesizing and configuring circuits for field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).

However, in the case of inter-harmonics the FFT produces large errors in estimating these RMS values.

In order to minimize the spectral leakage associated with WPT the paper proposes an algorithm that is capable of choosing the most suitable wavelet family and hence mother wavelet. This reduces the error associated with wavelet analysis.

We show via simulations that the asymptotic bias and the MSE are significantly reduced when widely linear MV estimation is utilized.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.194","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232853.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","startPage":"757","endPage":"760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Widely Linear Minimum Variance Channel Estimation for MC-CDMA Systems Using Real Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Widely Linear Minimum Variance Channel Estimation for MC-CDMA Systems Using Real Modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232853/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9701916","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4232853/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Widely Linear Minimum Variance Channel Estimation for MC-CDMA Systems Using Real Modulation","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"T43-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038487S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4232854,"authors":[{"name":"James Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"James","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37666737100"},{"name":"Shahzad Bashir","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Shahzad","lastName":"Bashir","id":"37700998500"},{"name":"David G.

Cluster identification is thus an obvious and essential first step in the channel modeling process. However, despite the tremendous effort that has been applied to ultra wideband (UWB) channel modeling by groups such as IEEE 802.15.3a and 802.15.4a in recent years, clusters are still usually identified through time-consuming manual techniques that rely on subjective assessment by the analyst. This presents a significant limitation to development of channel models applicable to new environments. Our algorithm for automated identification of clusters in UWB CIRs seeks to overcome these limitations by making cluster identification less subjective and less time consuming. The starting point for the algorithm is expression of the UWB power delay profile (PDP) on a semi-logarithmic scale so that exponential decay profiles will be displayed as straight lines with constant slopes. After the most significant MPCs have been identified by searching for local maxima within the PDP, an iterative procedure is used to determine the combination of straight lines that best fit these MPCs and thereby not exceed a threshold for RMS error. The number of clusters that are required is defined by number of straight lines while the slopes of the lines define the cluster decay rate. By assuming that incrementing the number of clusters used to represent a CIR will always involve subdividing an existing cluster, we reduce the number of combinations dramatically (and make the algorithm tractable). Cluster identification trials conducted using UWB CIRs generated using a simulation code developed by the IEEE 802.15.4a channel modeling committee have confirmed the validity of our approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232854.pdf","startPage":"761","endPage":"764","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232854","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Identification of Clusters in UWB Channel Impulse Responses","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Ultra wideband technology","Manuals","Iterative algorithms","Radioactive decay","Laboratories","Research and development","Councils","Delay effects","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra wideband communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UWB channel impulse responses","cluster identification","channel modeling process","IEEE 802.15.3a","IEEE 802.15.4a"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Automated Identification of Clusters in UWB Channel Impulse Responses","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232854/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9701917","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Identification of Clusters in UWB Channel Impulse Responses","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"T43-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044954S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4232865,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A multi-branch polynomial model is derived at each average power level. The models' accuracy in predicting the PA's output spectrum under average input power mismatch is evaluated. Then, the model's parameters variation versus the average input power is considered. It is shown that there is no straightforward analytical function that might take into account for the parameters variation with respect to the average input power level.

To partially recover the performance loss associated with symbol-by-symbol noncoherent detection, we consider the application of multiple-symbol detection (MSD), in which block-wise decisions are made using an observation window of many bit intervals. Significantly, we develop a fast decoding algorithm for optimal MSD, which avoids the complexity of an exhaustive search over all candidate sequences.

During the last decade, several satellite experiments discovered new phenomena in the ionosphere and magnetosphere that had preceded earthquakes. In this research, we suggest a novel early warning system for earthquakes based on wireless sensor network (WSN). A WSN based on single antenna wireless sensor nodes are cooperating to establish a multiple-antenna WSN that is called virtual MIMO-WSN. Virtual MIMO-WSN has adjustable and tuning capabilities to monitor different frequencies based on the number of the cooperative wireless sensor nodes. An electromagnetic map could be generated by activating a virtual MIMO-WSN in specific direction (North-South, East-West, North-West, North-East, South-West, South-East) by switching (ON/OFF) certain sensor nodes based on their location. Cost effectiveness, system scalability, ease of deployment, adjustable frequency tuning, and reliable ELF/VLF direction finding are key design factors in virtual MIMO-WSN, overcoming the existing techniques for ELF/VLF monitoring systems. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed virtual MIMO-WSN in adjustable frequency system tuning, and reliable ELF/VLF direction finding.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Earthquake Warning System Based on Virtual MIMO-Wireless Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.238","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232897.pdf","startPage":"932","endPage":"935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232897/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Earthquake Warning System Based on Virtual MIMO-Wireless Sensor Networks","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232897/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9701960","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Earthquake Warning System Based on Virtual MIMO-Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"T52-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066037S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4232925,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrez Souden","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Mehrez","lastName":"Souden","id":"37294213100"},{"name":"Sofiene Affes","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Sofiene","lastName":"Affes","id":"37265164500"},{"name":"Jacob Benesty","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e0bec, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Benesty","id":"37274630700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1021-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1020-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4232925","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensor arrays","Taylor series","Covariance matrix","Scattering parameters","Parameter estimation","Jacobian matrices","Computational modeling","Base stations","Algorithm design and analysis","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","direction-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed-form estimators","angle of arrival","angular spread","locally scattered source","uniform linear array","Taylor series expansions","covariance matrix"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232925","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232925.pdf","startPage":"1042","endPage":"1045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Closed-Form Estimators for the Angle of Arrival and the Angular Spread of a Locally Scattered Source","abstract":"We estimate the angular spread (AS) and the nominal angle of arrival (AoA) of a locally scattered source using a uniform linear array (ULA) of sensors.

In wireless MIMO communication systems which utilize antenna array at both transmit and receive sides, the redundancy of multipath signals can be exploited to extract more parameters such as angle-of-arrival, angle-of-departure and delay-of-arrival using advanced array signal processing techniques. In this paper, based on estimated multipath signal parameters in wireless MIMO communication systems, we propose a novel machine learning approach to determine the position of mobile targets using only one base station. This approach adopted the nearest neighbor regressor as the learning machine to estimation the highly nonlinear relationship between the multipath signal parameters and the position of mobile target. The simulation results have demonstrated the viability of the proposed methodology. This solution breaks the bottleneck of conventional mobile positioning systems which have to require multilateration of at least three base stations.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.272","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232931.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","startPage":"1066","endPage":"1069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Location in MIMO Communication Systems by Using Learning Machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Location in MIMO Communication Systems by Using Learning Machine","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232931/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9701994","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4232931/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Location in MIMO Communication Systems by Using Learning Machine","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"T59-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059148S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4232946,"authors":[{"name":"Huiju Cheng","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada"],"firstName":"Huiju","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37696205500"},{"name":"Howard M.

In the hardware design of cryptographic algorithms, concurrent error detection (CED) techniques have been proposed not only to protect the encryption and decryption process from random faults but also from the intentionally injected faults by some attackers. In our design, we also investigate a multiple parity code based error detection scheme. In our CED scheme, all the components are protected and all single-bit faults and most multiple faults will be detected. We study the implementation of the compact architecture for an ASIC and an FPGA.

We then show the a priori dependence of CLEAN, and propose a modified multi-template approach to overcome these issues while retaining its high-resolution capability.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.302","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232961.pdf","startPage":"1183","endPage":"1186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Resolution, Multi-Template Deconvolution Algorithm for Time-Domain UWB Channel Characterization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232961/","displayDocTitle":"A High-Resolution, Multi-Template Deconvolution Algorithm for Time-Domain UWB Channel Characterization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9702022","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232961/","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Resolution, Multi-Template Deconvolution Algorithm for Time-Domain UWB Channel Characterization","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"W67-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047287S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4232974,"authors":[{"name":"Suzanne Rigler","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Suzanne","lastName":"Rigler","id":"37692011800"},{"name":"William Bishop","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Bishop","id":"37270479800"},{"name":"Andrew Kennings","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Kennings","id":"37299881800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1021-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1020-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4232974","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":2726},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data compression","Hardware","Data communication","Data storage systems","Field programmable gate arrays","Application specific integrated circuits","Measurement","Resource management","Prototypes","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","data compression","field programmable gate arrays","finite state machines","hardware description languages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based lossless data compression","Huffman-LZ77 algorithms","data communication systems","data storage systems","patent-free compression program","Huffman encoders","VHDL","state machines","ASIC technologies","Altera DE2 board","hardware design","GZIP encoder"]}],"abstract":"Lossless data compression algorithms are widely used by data communication systems and data storage systems to reduce the amount of data transferred and stored.

In this day and age, Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are often engaged to implement digital communication systems instead of ASICs due to the speed, performance, reliability and flexibility. Digital communication systems such as MODEM (modulation-demodulation) and M-PSK require the application of carrier synchronization in phase and frequency. Our work attains the successful FPGA implementation and emulation of a digital carrier synchronizer (DCS), which is a phase-locked loop (PLL), realized using digital circuits. The key role of this DCS depends largely on the numerically controlled oscillator (NCO). There are numerous configurations to realize NCOs that are employed in the architectural model of DCS. This paper evaluates the performance of three different NCOs realization in DCS for modem (modulator-demodulator) application using FPGA based design solutions. The configurations adopted are look up table (LUT), CORDIC and Xilinx ROM based NCO. There are advantages and trade-offs associated with each configuration. From our investigation it can be stated that the configuration of DCS involving Xilinx ROM based NCO performs better and are more suited for modem's DCS.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.317","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232976.pdf","startPage":"1243","endPage":"1246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.317","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation and Performance Evaluation of a Digital Carrier Synchronizer Using Different Numerically Controlled Oscillators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232976","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232976/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA Implementation and Performance Evaluation of a Digital Carrier Synchronizer Using Different Numerically Controlled Oscillators","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9702037","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232976/","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA Implementation and Performance Evaluation of a Digital Carrier Synchronizer Using Different Numerically Controlled Oscillators","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"W70-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066938S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232976","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4232986,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Capacitor banks are commonly installed in various parts of the electric grid to maintain voltage levels within proper limits. In general, feeders in distribution systems include the majority of shunt capacitors installations to boost up voltage levels. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to optimally solve the problem of determining the location and size of shunt capacitors in distribution systems. Traditionally, the problem is usually solved in two steps; first by determining the location of the \"needed\" bus and then selecting the proper size. The proposed method solves the problems of finding the optimal capacitor size and location simultaneously. Throughout the optimization process, both the capacitor injected reactive power and its location are being treated as discrete variables. The objective function considered in this paper is to minimize the total feeder losses. The proposed algorithm was tested on a standard test system. Results signify the robustness of the proposed algorithm in solving this difficult integer programming problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232986/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9702047","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4232986/","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Optimal Capacitor Placement and Sizing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for Optimal Capacitor Placement and Sizing","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"W72-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046821S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232986","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4232987,"authors":[{"name":"M.

So far, two standards have been proposed to the IEEE 802.15.3a task group (TG3a) as a high-speed physical technology for next-generation wireless personal area networks (WPAN). These technologies are multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) UWB and direct-sequence (DS) UWB; two incompatible standards which, due to the withdrawal of the standardization process, will have to coexist in the near future. In this paper, we present a performance analysis of MB-OFDM UWB communication in the presence of binary phase shift keying time-hopping (BPSK-TH) UWB and BPSK-DS UWB interfering transmissions. In the bit error rate (BER) analysis, it is considered that there are multiple UWB interferers affecting the MB-OFDM signal. A Gaussian approximation is considered for the multiple UWB interferers under consideration, and the BER performance is evaluated for a multiband OFDM UWB system and the WLAN 802.11a singleband OFDM-based standard. Numerical results and comparisons are provided for different OFDM and UWB coexisting systems.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.337","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04232996.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","startPage":"1337","endPage":"1340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Analysis of MB-OFDM in the Presence of Multiple UWB Interferers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4232996","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance Analysis of MB-OFDM in the Presence of Multiple UWB Interferers","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4232996/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9702059","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4232996/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Analysis of MB-OFDM in the Presence of Multiple UWB Interferers","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"W75-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054354S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4232996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4233002,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Sheng Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Xin Sheng","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38253092400"},{"name":"Bruce Cockburn","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Bruce","lastName":"Cockburn","id":"37272651800"},{"name":"Stephen Bates","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Bates","id":"37295809200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1021-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1020-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4233002","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":60},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Convolutional codes","Microprocessors","Iterative decoding","Throughput","Hardware","Computer architecture","Memory architecture","Application specific integrated circuits","Time to market"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","decoding","microprocessor chips","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low density parity check convolutional code encoder","XInC MIMD multithreaded microprocessor","LDPC-CC","parallel encoder","decoder algorithms","memory-based decoder architecture","hardware utilization"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative Evaluation of Low Density Parity Check Convolutional Code Encoder and Decoder Algorithms for the XInC MIMD Multithreaded Microprocessor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4233002","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.343","startPage":"1361","endPage":"1365","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04233002.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce low density parity check convolutional code (LDPC-CC) parallel encoder and decoder algorithms for the XInC MIMD multi-threaded microprocessor.

Conventional GPS receivers can acquire the GPS codephase relatively easily when in direct line of sight with the satellites. However, acquisition becomes difficult with highly attenuated signals found inside buildings. Recent government regulations aim to improve 911 service for wireless telephones by supplying dispatchers with caller location, however, this requires the development of new technologies. With extensive signal averaging, GPS signals can provide positioning within large buildings. We assume 5dB/floor of signal attenuation so the GPS signal would be -183 dBWor less at the bottom of a 5-story building. We assume 2 MHz system bandwidth and surrounding walls at room temperature of 290 K (17degC) so the Boltzmann noise is -141 dBW. More than 50 dB SNR improvement is provided by an accumulating segmented matched filter that is robust to polarity reversals caused by Doppler frequency offset and by GPS data transitions. Through simulation, performance comparisons are made to a conventional matched filter (CMF) operating without polarity reversals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4233040/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4233040/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9702107","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of Weak Indoor GPS Signals with Doppler Using a Segmented Matched Filter and Accumulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of Weak Indoor GPS Signals with Doppler Using a Segmented Matched Filter and Accumulation","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"W86-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050465S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4233040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4233043,"authors":[{"name":"Nizar Messaoudi","affiliation":["IRadio Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Nizar","lastName":"Messaoudi","id":"37697706500"},{"name":"Oualid Hammi","affiliation":["IRadio Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Oualid","lastName":"Hammi","id":"37294250700"},{"name":"Jerome Sirois","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Jerome","lastName":"Sirois","id":"37396090300"},{"name":"Slim Boumaiza","affiliation":["IRadio Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada"],"firstName":"Slim","lastName":"Boumaiza","id":"37283433900"},{"name":"Fadhel M.

The two considered architectures are a single branch class AB power amplifier, and a multi-branch architecture using the Doherty dynamic load modulation technique. Two LDMOS based power amplifiers operating around 1.95 GHz are used. The magnitude of the load reflection coefficient is varied from 0 to 0.2 in steps of 0.05. For each of these values, the phase of the load reflection coefficient is swept over 360\u00b0 in steps of 45\u00b0. The amplifiers' linearity and power added efficiency variations with the load reflection coefficients are evaluated. It is found that the Doherty amplifier is less sensitive to load mismatch than a single branch class AB amplifier in terms of its efficiency performance. However, the linearity performance of the single branch class AB amplifier is less sensitive to the load mismatch than that of the Doherty amplifier.","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.384","startPage":"1543","endPage":"1546","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04233043.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Comparative Study of Power Amplifiers' Sensitivity to Load Mismatch: Single Branch vs. Doherty Architectures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Comparative Study of Power Amplifiers' Sensitivity to Load Mismatch: Single Branch vs. Doherty Architectures","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4233043/","accessionNumber":"9702110","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4233043/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Comparative Study of Power Amplifiers' Sensitivity to Load Mismatch: Single Branch vs. Doherty Architectures","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"W86-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077549S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4233043","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4233062,"authors":[{"name":"K.

DVC primarily has a modified complexity balance between the encoder and decoder, in contrast to conventional video codecs. In video communications over wireless channels, the noise and multipath fading effects have a significant effect on the perceptual video quality experienced at the decoder. However, it is noted that in all the research literature on DVC, an error-free ideal communication channel is assumed between the encoder and decoder. In this paper, we take into account the effects of noise and fading in a wireless channel on the performance of a DVC codec with necessary modifications to the decoding algorithm while proposing a higher order (4x4) MIMO based diversity scheme to take advantage of the multipath propagation effects to improve the performance. Simulation results show that the proposed DVC system outperform the state of the art H.264 video codec at low SNR levels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO Wireless Channel for Video Communications using Distributed Video Coding","publicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2007.403","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Canadian Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4232658/4232659/04233062.pdf","startPage":"1610","endPage":"1613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2007.403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4232659","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4233062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4233062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"MIMO Wireless Channel for Video Communications using Distributed Video Coding","conferenceDate":"22-26 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4233062/","dateOfInsertion":"30 July 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9702127","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO Wireless Channel for Video Communications using Distributed Video Coding","confLoc":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"W91-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073234S","chronDate":"22-26 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4232658","isNumber":"4232659","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4232658","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4232659","articleId":"4233062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4233063,"authors":[{"name":"Munir Arshad","affiliation":["Poly-Grames Research Center, D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9nie \u00c9lectrique, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Munir","lastName":"Arshad","id":"37075485700"},{"name":"Jean-Francois Frigon","affiliation":["Poly-Grames Research Center, D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9nie \u00c9lectrique, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Jean-Francois","lastName":"Frigon","id":"37299059100"},{"name":"Yanyang Zhao","affiliation":["Poly-Grames Research Center, D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9nie \u00c9lectrique, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Yanyang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37557068300"},{"name":"Renato Bosisio","affiliation":["Poly-Grames Research Center, D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9nie \u00c9lectrique, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Bosisio","id":"37270742300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1021-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1020-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"4233063","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receivers","RF signals","Radio frequency","Wireless communication","Fading","Baseband","Filters","Ultra wideband technology","Phase detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","radio receivers","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["six-port receiver","OFDM signals","single carrier communications","impulse ultrawideband radio","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multicarrier modulation techniques","high speed wireless communication systems","IEEE 802.11"]}],"abstract":"A significant amount of work has been carried out on the application of six-port receivers for single carrier communications and for the impulse ultra-wideband radio, however a small interest has been shown on the research of its use for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems.

The various optimization processes of a 2-D DCT transform, including adding different processor instruction sets onto the base processor to speedup software execution, are described. The results show a 26.76 times speed increase by adding a 4-way SIMD (single instruction multiple data) instruction with moderate hardware cost for a simple 2-D DCT implementation. The optimized 4-way SIMD processor is implemented on the FPGA board to verify the design, and shows a further significant speedup for on-board calculation compared to instruction-set simulation results.

In an effort to maintain and protect their community of believers, therefore, the Amish require that every technology they use not only conforms to, but reinforces their tradition, culture, and religion. They achieve these goals through two primary techniques. First they choose technologies that they believe will best promote the values they hold most dear - values like humility, equality, and simplicity. Thus they have rejected the speed, glamour and personal expression of automobiles in favor of modest, slow. and community-building horse- drawn buggies. Second, they deliberately choose tools that are different from those used by the outside world. This differentiation helps them maintain their unique identity, bonds their community, and ensures that they will continue to be able to accept technology on their own terms. The Amish view technologies as value-laden tools and use these tools to reinforce their values and build their community. While many scholars of technology have argued that this is the case, the Amish employ the idea in order to build the world they want to live in.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4233104/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"11 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2007","publicationDate":"Summer 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4233104/","dateOfInsertion":"11 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9728498","volume":"26","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Amish Technology: Reinforcing values and building community","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amish Technology: Reinforcing values and building community","sourcePdf":"262007-Jameson-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054968S","chronDate":"Summer  2007","xplore-pub-id":"44","isNumber":"4231754","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"44","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4231754","articleId":"4233104","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4233798,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Xiao","affiliation":["Real Time Power and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Missouri, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37286671300"},{"name":"Ganesh K.

New naval power systems employ higher voltage DC distribution and use solid state power converters that actively (and instantaneously) limit the available fault current. When conventional circuit breakers are used in these systems, they have a relatively long clearing time, causing the voltage to collapse for a significant time. The application of fast-acting solid state circuit breakers, based on IGBTs and IGCTs will eliminate such voltage dips and result in a superior power system. Solid state circuit breakers also offer advantages when used in traditional ship power systems by limiting fault currents to levels far below those dictated by the supplying generators. This leads to lower magnetic and thermal stresses on distribution components, lower energy delivered to faults, faster fault isolation and minimal voltage disturbance.","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Electric Ship Technologies Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Electric Ship Technologies Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233784/4233785/04233822.pdf","startPage":"201","endPage":"208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuit Breaker Technologies for Advanced Ship Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/ESTS.2007.372086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4233785","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTS.2007.372086","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4233822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4233822/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Circuit Breaker Technologies for Advanced Ship Power Systems","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9693142","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4233822/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuit Breaker Technologies for Advanced Ship Power Systems","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"ESTS-00-37.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030667S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4233784","isNumber":"4233785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4233784","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4233785","articleId":"4233822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4233825,"authors":[{"name":"Mesut E.

Two types of induction machine internal faults are investigated, rotor broken bar, and stator shorted turns faults. Early detection and diagnosis of these faults are desirable for condition assessment, maintenance schedule and improved operational efficiency of induction motors. The terminal behavior of the induction motor was obtained by coupling the induction motor transient FE model and external electric circuit. Such a model would allow efficient representation of the induction machine with internal faults. A discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was then used to extract the different harmonic components of the stator currents. The key advantages of the DWT are its ability to provide a local representation of the nonstationary current signals for normal and faulty operating conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Electric Ship Technologies Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233784/4233785/04233830.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"253","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Electric Ship Technologies Symposium","doi":"10.1109/ESTS.2007.372094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTS.2007.372094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4233785","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4233830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and characterization of induction motor internal faults using finite element and discrete wavelet transforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Induction motors","Finite element methods","Circuit faults","Induction machines","Stators","Voltage","Rotors","Electrical fault detection","Fault diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","discrete wavelet transforms","fault location","finite element analysis","induction motors","maintenance engineering","rotors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor internal faults","finite element model","discrete wavelet transforms","three phase induction motors","sinusoidal supply voltages","rotor broken bar","stator shorted turns faults","faults diagnosis","faults detection","condition assessment","maintenance schedule","external electric circuit","DWT","harmonic components","terminal behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Induction machines","FE","Internal faults","discrete wavelet transforms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4233830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and characterization of induction motor internal faults using finite element and discrete wavelet transforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4233830/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9693150","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and characterization of induction motor internal faults using finite element and discrete wavelet transforms","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"ESTS-00-45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07878S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4233784","isNumber":"4233785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4233784","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4233785","articleId":"4233830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4233837,"authors":[{"name":"Hymiar Hamilton","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Mississippi State University, MS, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233784/4233785/4233837/4233837-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hymiar Hamilton graduated from Mississippi State University with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering in 2004.

One of the new proposed distribution systems on the all-electric ship (E-ship) is designed using a DC distribution method (zones) in which the use of transformers and possible frequency issues/manipulations can be eliminated with the use of power electronics. These power electronic devices can greatly simplify the system by providing more available space, possible cost reduction, and variable control. One key feature is to make sure that the DC buses/systems and converters/rectifiers are protected from faults/arcing, transients, and other malicious events that can cause unwanted interference, shutdown, and possible damage or destruction. DC faults/arcing can have a detrimental impact on the ship performance. DC protection should permit high speed and high sensitivity detection of faults enhancing reliability in the supply of electric power. DC fault protection geared towards a lower voltage scenario/system has not yet been studied and analyzed rigorously. The research goal has been to develop a method in which the system can detect a DC fault and arcing phenomena and return to normal operating conditions once the fault is removed. The method also ensures that transient load changes will not be detected as faults tripping a false alarm. The use of power electronics, logic, and DC fault detection methods will be employed to solve how to protect the system and maintain stability.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Electric Ship Technologies Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233784/4233785/04233837.pdf","startPage":"294","endPage":"300","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Electric Ship Technologies Symposium","doi":"10.1109/ESTS.2007.372101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTS.2007.372101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4233785","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4233837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DC Protection on the Electric Ship","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine vehicles","Power system protection","Power electronics","Electrical fault detection","Fault detection","Transformers","Frequency","Costs","Electric variables control","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arcs (electric)","electric vehicles","fault diagnosis","power convertors","power distribution protection","power distribution reliability","power transformers","rectifying circuits","ships"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC protection","distribution systems","all-electric ship","DC distribution method","transformers","power electronics","cost reduction","variable control","converters-rectifiers","DC faults-arcing","sensitivity detection","electric power supply reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["12-Pulse Converter","Arcing","DC Fault","Harmonics","LVDC","Stability","Transformers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4233837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"DC Protection on the Electric Ship","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4233837/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","accessionNumber":"9693157","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC Protection on the Electric Ship","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"ESTS-00-52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095691S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4233784","isNumber":"4233785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4233784","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4233785","articleId":"4233837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4233840,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This paper uses a high fidelity modeling and simulation approach to investigate the impact of real and reactive power, pulse ramp rate, pulse duration and frequency of occurrence of the pulsed power load. For this purpose, a notional shipboard power system, modeled in a real-time digital simulator, is used. Most pulsed loads on shipboard systems are not fed directly from the prime power system but via an energy storage system. This energy storage system in turn is interfaced with the shipboard prime power system typically through an electronic front-end charging circuit.

RMS variations in system power were successfully reduced and several avenues for controller development were suggested by the results.","doi":"10.1109/ESTS.2007.372126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTS.2007.372126","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Electric Ship Technologies Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233784/4233785/04233862.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Electric Ship Technologies Symposium","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4233785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-in-the-Loop Experiments on the Use of Propulsion Motors to Reduce Pulse-Load System Disturbances","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 May 2007","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-in-the-Loop Experiments on the Use of Propulsion Motors to Reduce Pulse-Load System Disturbances","conferenceDate":"21-23 May 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4233862/","accessionNumber":"9693182","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4233862/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-in-the-Loop Experiments on the Use of Propulsion Motors to Reduce Pulse-Load System Disturbances","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"ESTS-00-77.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094845S","chronDate":"21-23 May 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4233784","isNumber":"4233785","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4233784","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4233785","articleId":"4233862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4233879,"authors":[{"name":"Hisao Ishibuchi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems, Osaka Prefecture University, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisao","lastName":"Ishibuchi","id":"37276592200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0703-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4233879","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4233879","abstract":"The main advantage of fuzzy rule-based systems over other non-linear models such as neural networks is their high interpretability. Fuzzy rules can be usually interpreted in a linguistic manner because they are described by linguistic values such as small and large. Fuzzy rule-based systems have high accuracy as well as high interpretability. A large number of tuning methods have been proposed to improve their accuracy. Most of those tuning methods are based on learning algorithms of neural networks and/or evolutionary optimization techniques. Accuracy improvement of fuzzy rule-based systems, however, is usually achieved at the cost of interpretability. This is because the accuracy improvement often increases the complexity of fuzzy rule-based systems. Thus one important issue in the design of fuzzy rule-based systems is to find a good tradeoff between the accuracy and the complexity. The importance of finding a good accuracy-complexity tradeoff has been pointed out in some studies in the late 1990s. Recently evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms were used to search for various fuzzy rule-based systems with different accuracy-complexity tradeoffs. Users are supposed to choose a final model based on their preference from the obtained fuzzy rule-based systems. Some users may prefer a simple one with high interpretability. Other users may prefer a complicated one with high accuracy. In this paper, we explain evolutionary multiobjective approaches to the design of accurate and interpretable fuzzy rule-based systems. We also suggest some future research directions related to the evolutionary multiobjective design of fuzzy rule-based systems.","doi":"10.1109/FOCI.2007.372141","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computational Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233874/4233875/04233879.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computational Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCI.2007.372141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4233875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary Multiobjective Design of Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy systems","Knowledge based systems","Training data","Fuzzy neural networks","Neural networks","Computational intelligence","System testing","Design optimization","Computer science","Intelligent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","fuzzy systems","knowledge based systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary multiobjective design","fuzzy rule-based systems","linguistic values","learning algorithms","neural networks","evolutionary optimization","evolutionary multiobjective optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4233879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary Multiobjective Design of Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4233879/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"1-5 April 2007","accessionNumber":"9529546","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary Multiobjective Design of Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"FOCI-00-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111595S","chronDate":"1-5 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4233874","isNumber":"4233875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4233874","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4233875","articleId":"4233879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4233880,"authors":[{"name":"Hans-Georg Beyer","affiliation":["Vorarlberg University of Applied Sciences, Dornbirn, Austria"],"firstName":"Hans-Georg","lastName":"Beyer","id":"37549762100"},{"name":"Bernhard Sendhoff","affiliation":["Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH, Offenbach, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Sendhoff","id":"37276617200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0703-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4233880","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Evolutionary computation","Convergence","Genetic algorithms","Noise robustness","Noise level","Computational intelligence","Algorithm design and analysis","Topology","Design optimization","Bifurcation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary algorithms","genetic algorithms","noisy optimization problems","functions with noise induced multimodality","global optimizer","resampling strategies"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4233880","doi":"10.1109/FOCI.2007.372142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCI.2007.372142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4233875","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computational Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computational Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233874/4233875/04233880.pdf","startPage":"17","endPage":"24","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary Algorithms in the Presence of Noise: To Sample or Not to Sample","abstract":"In this paper, we empirically analyze the convergence behavior of evolutionary algorithms (evolution strategies - ES and genetic algorithms A) for two noisy optimization problems which belong to the class of functions with noise induced multi-modality (FNIMs).

Due to increase in computational power available for researchers, many impressive simulations have been carried out and some other ones are yet to come. These developments in CI have occurred simultaneously with some very interesting theoretical and empirical results in random graph theory - the introduction of small-world (Watts and Strogatz, 1998) and scale-free (Barabasi and Albert, 1999), (Albert and Barabasi, 2002) models, and investigation of their properties. Based on results already published by other authors (Davey et al., 2004), (Kwok et al., 2006) we believe that the edge of these two dynamically growing disciplines might be an interesting field for research. In this paper we introduce a simplified model of spike flow network which in some details resembles a recurrent neural network with stochastic dynamics. We argue that within this setup a scale-free network structure emerges as a natural consequence of model structuring principles and we provide numerical evidence supporting this claim. Further in the paper we investigate a number of interesting properties of this network and discuss some consequences of this result","doi":"10.1109/FOCI.2007.371496","pdfPath":"/iel5/4233874/4233875/04233930.pdf","startPage":"357","endPage":"362","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computational Intelligence","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computational Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FOCI.2007.371496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4233875","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Emergence of Scale-free Spike Flow Graphs in Recurrent Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4233930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Emergence of Scale-free Spike Flow Graphs in Recurrent Neural Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9507008","publicationDate":"April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4233930/","conferenceDate":"1-5 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emergence of Scale-free Spike Flow Graphs in Recurrent Neural Networks","confLoc":"Honolulu, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"FOCI-00-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079907S","chronDate":"1-5 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4233874","isNumber":"4233875","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4233874","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4233875","articleId":"4233930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4233931,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The conventional strategy is always to conduct an internal training cycle for the specified object at each time step based on relative information in two consecutive moments. Whereas, in our work, the mechanism of eligibility traces is adopted for the learning of the cost function or its derivatives. The new learning depends on the current error combined with traces of past events. For the classical single cart-pole balancing problem, we implement our idea with one typical adaptive critic design, i.e. action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming.

The proposed speech scrambling system depends on the parallel structure of using two different types of wavelets with the same decomposition levels. In this system, Db1 wavelet along with Haar wavelet, Db2 wavelet along with Sym2 wavelet and Db4 wavelet along with Sym4 wavelet for the same level are implemented. The performance evaluation process of the proposed system was taken into consideration via the using of noise power levels (5, 15 and 25 dB) in the simulated communication channel. The system performance was tested using the subjective test, by plying back the original, scrambled, and descrambled signal to a number of listeners in order to estimate the intelligibility of the played signals, and objective test, using the (linear prediction coding, cepstral distance and segmental signal to noise ratio). The results of this work is promising , and they can be considered as a backbone for a future programs, since for the first time the concept of parallel structure for transformation was introduced in analog speech scrambling techniques based on the transform domain philosophy. This approach provides more security for the resulted scrambled speech signal in comparison with the conventional scrambling approach using only a single orthogonal transformation like FFT, DCT, or Walsh Hadmard transform (WHT), and the DWT in classical structure.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 National Radio Science Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234083/4234084/04234111.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","publicationTitle":"2007 National Radio Science Conference","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2007.371364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRSC.2007.371364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4234084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4234111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Proposed Analog Speech Scrambler Based on Parallel Structure of Wavelet Transforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Wavelet transforms","System testing","Noise level","Communication channels","System performance","Cepstral analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Spine","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","speech processing","telecommunication security","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","analog speech scrambler","parallel structure","wavelet transforms","analog speech signals","Db1 wavelet","Haar wavelet","Db2 wavelet","Sym2 wavelet","Db4 wavelet","Sym4 wavelet","noise power levels","objective test","FFT","DCT","Walsh Hadmard transform","DWT"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["analog speech scrambling","wavelet transformation","subjective test","objective test"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4234111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"A Proposed Analog Speech Scrambler Based on Parallel Structure of Wavelet Transforms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4234111/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9622605","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"13-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Proposed Analog Speech Scrambler Based on Parallel Structure of Wavelet Transforms","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"NRSC-00-27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074806S","chronDate":"13-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4234083","isNumber":"4234084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4234083","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4234084","articleId":"4234111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Adademy of Science, EgyptIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4234113,"authors":[{"name":"Usama Sayed Mohammad","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt"],"firstName":"Usama Sayed","lastName":"Mohammad","id":"37688605800"},{"name":"M.

It is shown that iteratively minimizing the cost function such as the off-diagonal of the cross power spectral (CPS) matrices of the signals at the output of the mixing system is sufficient to identify the separating system at each frequency bin up to a scale and permutation ambiguity. The minimization of the cost function is performed using gradient-based optimization method. Then the inverse of the mixing system is estimated and used to separate the mixed sources. The performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using a mixing of audio signals, BPSK signals, and image signals. The algorithm demonstrates good separation performance and enhanced output audio quality with fast convergence speed relative to the traditional methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency Domain Approach for Blind Signal Separation of Convolutive Mixed Signals","publicationTitle":"2007 National Radio Science Conference","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2007.371366","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 National Radio Science Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234083/4234084/04234113.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRSC.2007.371366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4234084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4234113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4234113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Frequency Domain Approach for Blind Signal Separation of Convolutive Mixed Signals","conferenceDate":"13-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4234113/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9622607","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency Domain Approach for Blind Signal Separation of Convolutive Mixed Signals","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"NRSC-00-29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050889S","chronDate":"13-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4234083","isNumber":"4234084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4234083","xplore-issue":"4234084","articleId":"4234113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Adademy of Science, Egypt","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4234114,"authors":[{"name":"Sharaf El-Din El-Nahas","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"Sharaf El-Din","lastName":"El-Nahas","id":"38271559100"},{"name":"Ammar Mottie Al Hosainy","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport, Alexandria, Egypt"],"firstName":"Ammar Mottie","lastName":"Al Hosainy","id":"38276874400"},{"name":"Magdy M.

This is done using the well-known moment generating function (MGF) analysis approach and in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function.

MC-CDMA with its frequency diversity is an attractive modulation scheme for multi-user high data rate wireless communication system. However on OFDM and MC- CDMA sub-channel decomposition cannot be achieved without adding guard band or cyclic prefix, where a copy of the end part of the data symbol block is transmitted. Due to the relationship between circular and linear convolutions in discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the residual inter symbol interference (ISI) is eliminated by dropping the guard interval part in the receiver. This method needs transmitting extra guard interval signals that introduces overhead and thus leads to spectral inefficiency and performance degradation. An efficient scheme which not only counters the degrading effects of ISI but also conserves the bandwidth is the application of discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) based MC-CDMA. in this paper we replace Fourier based complex exponential carriers of MC-CDMA with an orthonormal wavelets packets, such as daubechies, haar, biorthogonal, discrete meyer and coiflets to compare the performance of MC-CDMA based discrete fourier transform (DFT) and MC-CDMA based discrete wavelet packet transform(DWPT).","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 National Radio Science Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234083/4234084/04234132.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 National Radio Science Conference","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2007.371385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRSC.2007.371385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4234084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4234132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet Packet Modulation for Multi-carrier CDMA Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet packets","Multiaccess communication","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Discrete Fourier transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","OFDM modulation","Intersymbol interference","Degradation","Frequency diversity","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","discrete Fourier transforms","discrete wavelet transforms","diversity reception","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthonormal wavelets packets","discrete wavelet packet transform","guard interval signals","residual inter symbol interference","DFT","discrete Fourier transform","sub-channel decomposition","high data rate wireless communication system","frequency diversity","OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multipath propagation effects","interference rejection capability","MC-CDMA","multi-carrier CDMA communications","wavelet packet modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT)","Intersymbol Interference (ISI)","Multi-carrier (MC-CDMA)","Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4234132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet Packet Modulation for Multi-carrier CDMA Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4234132/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9622625","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"13-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet Packet Modulation for Multi-carrier CDMA Communications","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"NRSC-00-48.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058883S","chronDate":"13-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4234083","isNumber":"4234084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4234083","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4234084","articleId":"4234132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Adademy of Science, EgyptIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4234136,"authors":[{"name":"Hassan M.

The algorithm finds a suitable power vector, i.e. the power levels that are determined in the base station and told to the mobile units so that if the mobile units adjust their transmitting levels to these power levels, they will fulfill the objectives of the power control problem. The proposed algorithm is based on a similar idea to the one presented in the paper by Moustafa et al (2000) and called 'genetic algorithm for mobiles equilibrium' (GAME). So, a detailed discussion of GAME is given then the proposed algorithm is presented. The application of the algorithm to the problem is investigated via testing the algorithm on a hypothetical CDMA network model. To illustrate its effectiveness, the proposed algorithm is then compared to the application of genetic algorithms (GA) to the same problem. Finally, a detailed example is studied considering a cell of 20 users that are allowed to update their positions and fading conditions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 National Radio Science Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234083/4234084/04234140.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2007 National Radio Science Conference","doi":"10.1109/NRSC.2007.371393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NRSC.2007.371393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4234084","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4234140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Control in CDMA System using Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Multiaccess communication","Particle swarm optimization","Interference","Base stations","Fading","Frequency division multiaccess","Power engineering and energy","Genetic algorithms","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","genetic algorithms","particle swarm optimisation","power control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power control","CDMA system","particle swarm optimization","power vector","genetic algorithm for mobiles equilibrium"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4234140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 March 2007","displayDocTitle":"Power Control in CDMA System using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4234140/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2007","accessionNumber":"9622596","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"13-15 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Control in CDMA System using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Cairo, Egypt","sourcePdf":"NRSC-00-56.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08461S","chronDate":"13-15 March 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4234083","isNumber":"4234084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4234083","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4234084","articleId":"4234140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Adademy of Science, EgyptIEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4234145,"authors":[{"name":"Ziad A.

The results show that currently available re- configurable computing technology can easily achieve significantly higher floating-point performance than high-end CPUs, running state-of-the-art routines for large matrices operations. For common reconfigurable systems, where the FPGAs are directly coupled to the on-board memory, the achievable performance scales directly with the number of realizable simultaneous memory accesses. A new dedicated reconfigurable architecture is proposed and analysed and the results show a performance improvement of 2x over the previous implementation, using only half of the memory and half of the floating-point units. Benchmarking against Matlab, which features high performance matrix inversion routines, shows that a 100 MHz FPGA can easily surpass the performance of 3,2 GHz Intel Pentium IV processors. This is possible having only 5 double-port memory banks or 9 single-port memory banks connected to the FPGA.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory Optimized Architecture for Efficient Gauss-Jordan Matrix Inversion","publicationTitle":"2007 3rd Southern Conference on Programmable Logic","doi":"10.1109/SPL.2007.371720","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 3rd Southern Conference on Programmable Logic","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234305/4234306/04234317.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"38","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPL.2007.371720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4234306","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4234317","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4234317/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-26 Feb. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Memory Optimized Architecture for Efficient Gauss-Jordan Matrix Inversion","conferenceDate":"28-26 Feb. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4234317/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9602776","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory Optimized Architecture for Efficient Gauss-Jordan Matrix Inversion","confLoc":"Mar del Plata, Argentina","sourcePdf":"SPL-00-11.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051834S","chronDate":"28-26 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4234305","isNumber":"4234306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4234305","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4234306","articleId":"4234317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4234322,"authors":[{"name":"Catherine L.

Compared with VPR's high-quality results, our method can reduce critical path delay by up to 31.74% (avg. 10%) without disturbing placement or sacrificing area. The CPU time used by the rewiring engine is only 5% of the total time consumed by VPR's placement and routing. All the benchmark circuits can be placed and routed within 3 minutes, which is much faster than the SPFD approach.

Among the fingerprint identification techniques, minutiae-based algorithms are the most mature. However, these methods are computationally expensive, particularly for comparison with large databases. This work is devoted to study the performance gains that can be achieved with the use of FPGAs. To this purpose, two minutia-based fingerprint matching algorithms have been selected and implemented in a FPGA in order to compare the requirements and performance of software and hardware implementations. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing fingerprint matching algorithms in current FPGA devices achieving speed-ups of one or two orders of magnitude.

Efforts on partitioning between muP and the FPGA are a manual and laborious effort, as a formal methodology for automatic hardware-software partitioning has not been established. Related fields such as heterogeneous computing (HC) and embedded computing (EC) have an extensive body of work for scheduling for heterogeneous processors. Unlike the HC scheduling algorithms, the EC algorithms take into account the differences in computational capabilities of each processing element. In this work, we adapt EC scheduling algorithms for RC systems, and show how simply adapting the algorithms alone is not sufficient to take advantage of the reconfigurable hardware. We introduce new heuristic algorithms based on EC scheduling algorithms and show that they provide up to an order of magnitude improvement in scheduling and execution times.","doi":"10.1109/SPL.2007.371729","publicationTitle":"2007 3rd Southern Conference on Programmable Logic","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 3rd Southern Conference on Programmable Logic","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234305/4234306/04234326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPL.2007.371729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4234306","startPage":"87","endPage":"92","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending Embedded Computing Scheduling Algorithms for Reconfigurable Computing Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4234326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Extending Embedded Computing Scheduling Algorithms for Reconfigurable Computing Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-26 Feb. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4234326/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-26 Feb. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9603074","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4234326/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending Embedded Computing Scheduling Algorithms for Reconfigurable Computing Systems","confLoc":"Mar del Plata, Argentina","sourcePdf":"SPL-00-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095709S","chronDate":"28-26 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4234305","isNumber":"4234306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4234305","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4234306","articleId":"4234326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4234330,"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Huerta","affiliation":["Escuela Superior de Ciencias Experimentales y Tecnolog\u00eda, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Huerta","id":"37572359500"},{"name":"Javier Castillo","affiliation":["Escuela Superior de Ciencias Experimentales y Tecnolog\u00eda, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Castillo","id":"37580274000"},{"name":"Jose Ignacio Martinez","affiliation":["Escuela Superior de Ciencias Experimentales y Tecnolog\u00eda, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose Ignacio","lastName":"Martinez","id":"37577576600"},{"name":"Cesar Pedraza","affiliation":["Escuela Superior de Ciencias Experimentales y Tecnolog\u00eda, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Cesar","lastName":"Pedraza","id":"37662099500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0606-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4234330","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Multiprocessing systems","Random access memory","System buses","Application software","System-on-a-chip","Buildings","Writing","Software performance","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering computing","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","multiprocessing systems","software libraries","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate array","software library","soft-core processor","intellectual property core","symmetric multiprocessor system","FPGA technology"]}],"abstract":"Advances in FPGA technologies allow designing highly complex systems using on-chip FPGA resources and intellectual property (IP) cores.

The state-of-the-art approach, proposed by (S.-H. Yang et al., 2005), uses a parallel algorithm to achieve high speed operation. Based on it, an area and speed efficient VLSI architecture was designed. However, as the size of the input image increases, the area cost increases as well. This paper proposes an optimization for the method from (S.-H. Yang et al., 2005), achieving considerable area cost reduction, mainly when large images are considered. The area economy is accomplished by processing the input image in partitions of columns. This way, the higher the number of columns of the input image, the greater will be the area cost reduction.","doi":"10.1109/SPL.2007.371740","publicationTitle":"2007 3rd Southern Conference on Programmable Logic","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 3rd Southern Conference on Programmable Logic","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234305/4234306/04234337.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPL.2007.371740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4234306","startPage":"155","endPage":"160","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Area Cost Optimized Fast Parallel Label Assignment VLSI Architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4234337","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Area Cost Optimized Fast Parallel Label Assignment VLSI Architecture","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-26 Feb. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4234337/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-26 Feb. 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9602782","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4234337/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Area Cost Optimized Fast Parallel Label Assignment VLSI Architecture","confLoc":"Mar del Plata, Argentina","sourcePdf":"SPL-00-31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057399S","chronDate":"28-26 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4234305","isNumber":"4234306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4234305","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4234306","articleId":"4234337","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4234338,"authors":[{"name":"Thaisa Silva","affiliation":["Group of Architectures and Integrated Circuits, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Thaisa","lastName":"Silva","id":"37408460800"},{"name":"Joao Vortmann","affiliation":["Group of Architectures and Integrated Circuits, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Joao","lastName":"Vortmann","id":"37688363500"},{"name":"Luciano Agostini","affiliation":["Group of Architectures and Integrated Circuits, Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Agostini","id":"37300469400"},{"name":"Sergio Bampi","affiliation":["Microelectronics Group, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Bampi","id":"37265059600"},{"name":"Altamiro Susin","affiliation":["Microelectronics Group, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil"],"firstName":"Altamiro","lastName":"Susin","id":"37277769300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0606-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4234338","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Based Design of CAVLC and Exp-Golomb Coders for H.264/AVC Baseline Entropy Coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4234338","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Automatic voltage control","Entropy coding","Code standards","Video compression","Codecs","Hardware","Microelectronics","Throughput","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","logic design","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA based design","Exp-Golomb coders","H.264/AVC baseline entropy coding","hardware architecture","H.264/AVC video compression standard","baseline entropy coder","CAVLC coder","architectural design","VHDL","Altera Stratix-II FPGA"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the design of a hardware architecture for the entropy coder of H.264/AVC video compression standard, considering the baseline profile.

One of the problems in realizing dynamically reconfigurable systems is the allocation of dynamically reconfigurable modules. In this scenario, when a new module has to be reconfigured in the system, there is the need to find a suitable free place where it can be configured. In this work a genetic algorithm has been developed to solve the problem of dynamically reconfigurable modules allocation. The search task has been modeled with a genetic algorithm in which each chromosome represents a configuration status of the programmable devices and both crossover and mutation processes try to change the previously found location for the new module in order to achieve a better fitness, that stands for the goodness of the final solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-26 Feb. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4234342/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9603078","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4234342/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"28-26 Feb. 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm Based Solution for Dynamically Reconfigurable Modules Allocation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm Based Solution for Dynamically Reconfigurable Modules Allocation","confLoc":"Mar del Plata, Argentina","sourcePdf":"SPL-00-36.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047382S","chronDate":"28-26 Feb. 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4234305","isNumber":"4234306","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4234305","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4234306","articleId":"4234342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4234345,"authors":[{"name":"Monica Liberatori","affiliation":["Electronics Department, UNMDP, Mar del Plata, Argentina"],"firstName":"Monica","lastName":"Liberatori","id":"37688363900"},{"name":"Fernando Otero","affiliation":["Electronics Department, UNMDP, Mar del Plata, Argentina"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Otero","id":"38181423500"},{"name":"J.

In an urban setting, the spectral information can be used to discriminate between the numerous different land cover types, both natural (vegetation) and human generated (roads and buildings), while the spatial information can be used to clearly delineate their boundaries. Standard image fusion methods, such as methods involving IHS or PCA, are often successful at injecting spatial detail; however, they tend to distort the colour information. The potential benefits of wavelet-based image fusion methods have recently been explored in a variety of fields and for a variety of purposes, in particular for fusing panchromatic and multi spectral imagery. In this paper, the results from a number of wavelet-based image fusion schemes are compared in terms of their similarities and differences, and their advantages and limitations. It was found that, while even the simplest wavelet-based fusion scheme tends to produce better results than standard fusion schemes such as IHS and PCA, particularly in terms of minimizing colour distortion, decimated and un decimated algorithms often disturb the linear continuity of spatial features. The results from wavelet-based methods can be improved by applying more sophisticated schemes or more advanced models for injecting detail information; however, these schemes are more computationally complex and often require the user to determine appropriate values for certain parameters, such as thresholds. More comprehensive testing is required in order to fully assess under what conditions each approach is most appropriate.","doi":"10.1109/URS.2007.371781","publicationTitle":"2007 Urban Remote Sensing Joint Event","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Urban Remote Sensing Joint Event","pdfPath":"/iel5/4234358/4234359/04234380.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URS.2007.371781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4234359","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of Wavelet Transforms in Image Fusion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4234380","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Applications of Wavelet Transforms in Image Fusion","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4234380/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-13 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9702664","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4234380/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applications of Wavelet Transforms in Image Fusion","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"URS-00-21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067377S","chronDate":"11-13 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4234358","isNumber":"4234359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4234358","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4234359","articleId":"4234380","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4237137,"authors":[{"name":"Yigal Bejerano","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/4237134/4237137/4237137-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yigal Bejerano (M'06) received the B.Sc. degree (summa cum laude) in computer engineering in 1991, the M.Sc. degree in computer science in 1995, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering in 2000, from the Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.","He is currently a Member of the Technical Staff at Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies, Murray Hill, NJ.

We argue that the load imbalance and consequent unfair bandwidth allocation can be greatly reduced by intelligent association control. In this paper, we present an efficient solution to determine the user-AP associations for max-min fair bandwidth allocation. We show the strong correlation between fairness and load balancing, which enables us to use load balancing techniques for obtaining optimal max-min fair bandwidth allocation. As this problem is NP-hard, we devise algorithms that achieve constant-factor approximation. In our algorithms, we first compute a fractional association solution, in which users can be associated with multiple APs simultaneously. This solution guarantees the fairest bandwidth allocation in terms of max-min fairness. Then, by utilizing a rounding method, we obtain the integral solution from the fractional solution. We also consider time fairness and present a polynomial-time algorithm for optimal integral solution. We further extend our schemes for the on-line case where users may join and leave dynamically. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve close to optimal load balancing (i.e., max-min fairness) and they outperform commonly used heuristics.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2007.893680","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4237134/04237137.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2007.893680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237134","startPage":"560","endPage":"573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fairness and Load Balancing in Wireless LANs Using Association Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fairness and Load Balancing in Wireless LANs Using Association Control","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237137/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591439","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4237137/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fairness and Load Balancing in Wireless LANs Using Association Control","sourcePdf":"15tnet03-bejerano.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.216731S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4237134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"200","xplore-issue":"4237134","articleId":"4237137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4237146,"authors":[{"name":"Anurag Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/4237134/4237146/4237146-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Anurag Kumar (F'06) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, and the Ph.D. degree from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.","He was then with Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ, for over six years.

It is shown how the saturated network analysis can be used to obtain TCP transfer throughputs in some cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237146/","volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4237146/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591444","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"New Insights From a Fixed-Point Analysis of Single Cell IEEE 802.11 WLANs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Insights From a Fixed-Point Analysis of Single Cell IEEE 802.11 WLANs","sourcePdf":"15tnet03-kumar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088409S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4237134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"198","xplore-issue":"4237134","articleId":"4237146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4237149,"authors":[{"name":"Mortada Mehyar","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/4237134/4237149/4237149-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mortada Mehyar received the B.S. degree in mathematics from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., and the M.S. degree in applied physics from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena.

The algorithms are completely distributed and do not require any global coordination. In addition, they can be proven to converge under very general asynchronous timing assumptions.

Hence to select the best band for sending data, nodes first need to measure the channel in different bands which takes time away from sending actual data. We analyze the gains from opportunistic band selection by deriving an optimal skipping rule, which balances the throughput gain from finding a good quality band with the overhead of measuring multiple bands. We show that opportunistic band skipping is most beneficial in low signal to noise scenarios, which are typically the cases when the node throughput in single-band (no opportunism) system is the minimum. To study the impact of opportunism on network throughput, we devise a CSMA/CA protocol, multi-band opportunistic auto rate (MOAR), which implements the proposed skipping rule on a per node pair basis. The proposed protocol exploits both time and frequency diversity, and is shown to result in typical throughput gains of 20% or more over a protocol which only exploits time diversity, opportunistic auto rate (OAR).","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2007.893230","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4237134/04237154.pdf","startPage":"533","endPage":"545","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2007.893230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Spectral Usage: Bounds and a Multi-Band CSMA/CA Protocol","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237154","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Spectral Usage: Bounds and a Multi-Band CSMA/CA Protocol","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237154/","publicationDate":"June 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9591449","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237154/","volume":"15","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Spectral Usage: Bounds and a Multi-Band CSMA/CA Protocol","sourcePdf":"15tnet03-sabharwal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110964S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4237134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"4237134","articleId":"4237154","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4237156,"authors":[{"name":"Karthikeyan Sundaresan","affiliation":["Centergy One, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/4237134/4237156/4237156-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Karthikeyan Sundaresan received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication from Anna University, Chennai, India, in 2001, and the M.S. degree from the same institution in 2003.

The superior capabilities of smart antennas, however, can be leveraged only through appropriately designed higher layer network protocols, including at the medium access control (MAC) layer. Although several related works have considered such tailored protocols, they do so in the context of specific antenna technologies. In this paper, we explore the possibility for a unified approach to medium access control in ad hoc networks with smart antennas. We first present a unified representation of the PHY layer capabilities of the different types of smart antennas, and their relevance to MAC layer design. We then define a unified MAC problem formulation, and derive unified MAC algorithms (both centralized and distributed) from the formulation. Finally, using the algorithms developed, we investigate the relative performance trade-offs of the different technologies under varying network conditions. We also analyze theoretically the performance bounds of the different smart antenna technologies when the available gains are exploited for rate increase and communication range increase.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2007.893157","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4237134/04237156.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2007.893157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237134","startPage":"546","endPage":"559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified MAC Layer Framework for Ad-Hoc Networks With Smart Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237156","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Unified MAC Layer Framework for Ad-Hoc Networks With Smart Antennas","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237156/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591451","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4237156/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified MAC Layer Framework for Ad-Hoc Networks With Smart Antennas","sourcePdf":"15tnet03-sundaresan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065083S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4237134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4237134","articleId":"4237156","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4237165,"authors":[{"name":"Weiting Chen","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/4237161/4237165/4237165-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Weiting Chen received the M.S. degree in biomedical engineering in 2004, from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","Her research interests include nonlinear time series analysis, biomedical signal processing, and pattern recognition."]},"firstName":"Weiting","lastName":"Chen","id":"37537264100"},{"name":"Zhizhong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/4237161/4237165/4237165-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Zhizhong Wang received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China, in 1982 and 1984, respectively.","From 1985 to 1993, he was an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, where he was promoted to Professor in 1993.

Similar to the two existing related measures ApEn and SampEn, FuzzyEn is the negative natural logarithm of the conditional probability that two vectors similar for m points remain similar for the next m+1 points. Importing the concept of fuzzy sets, vectors' similarity is fuzzily defined in FuzzyEn on the basis of exponential function and their shapes. Besides possessing the good properties of SampEn superior to ApEn, FuzzyEn also succeeds in giving the entropy definition in the case of small parameters. Its performance on characterizing surface EMG signals, as well as independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random numbers and periodical sinusoidal signals, shows that FuzzyEn can more efficiently measure the regularity of time series.

The clinical tremor response to thalamic DBS for essential tremor is dependent on the stimulation frequency and amplitude, and for high frequencies (ges90 Hz), increasing amplitude suppressed tremor, whereas for low frequencies (<60 Hz), increasing amplitude aggravated tremor. We studied the effects of stimulation frequency and amplitude on the output of a population of intrinsically active model neurons to test the hypothesis that regularization of neuronal firing patterns is responsible for the clinical effectiveness of DBS. The firing patterns of model thalamocortical neurons were dependent on stimulation frequency and amplitude in a manner similar to the clinical tremor response. Above a critical frequency, increasing amplitude reduced the coefficient of variation (CV) of the neuronal firing pattern, whereas for low frequencies, increasing the amplitude increased the CV of neuronal activity. The correlation between the changes in tremor and the changes in the C V of neuronal firing supports the hypothesis that regularization of neuronal firing pattern during DBS is one of the mechanisms underlying the suppression of tremor.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2007.897004","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/7333/4237161/04237174.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"197","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2007.897004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude- and Frequency-Dependent Changes in Neuronal Regularity Parallel Changes in Tremor With Thalamic Deep Brain Stimulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude- and Frequency-Dependent Changes in Neuronal Regularity Parallel Changes in Tremor With Thalamic Deep Brain Stimulation","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4237174/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9744218","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","pubMedId":"17601188","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237174/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude- and Frequency-Dependent Changes in Neuronal Regularity Parallel Changes in Tremor With Thalamic Deep Brain Stimulation","sourcePdf":"15tnsre02-kuncel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073952S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"4237161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4237161","articleId":"4237174","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4237186,"authors":[{"name":"Fauzia Ahmad","affiliation":["Radar Imaging Laboratories, Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Fauzia Ahmad (S'97\u2013M'97\u2013SM'06) received the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, in 1996 and 1997, respectively.","From 1998 to 2000, she was an Assistant Professor with the College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan.

This paper presents novel classification algorithms for recognizing object activity using object motion trajectory. In the proposed classification system, trajectories are segmented at points of change in curvature, and the subtrajectories are represented by their principal component analysis (PCA) coefficients. We first present a framework to robustly estimate the multivariate probability density function based on PCA coefficients of the subtrajectories using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We show that GMM-based modeling alone cannot capture the temporal relations and ordering between underlying entities. To address this issue, we use hidden Markov models (HMMs) with a data-driven design in terms of number of states and topology (e.g., left-right versus ergodic). Experiments using a database of over 5700 complex trajectories (obtained from UCI-KDD data archives and Columbia University Multimedia Group) subdivided into 85 different classes demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HMM-based scheme using PCA coefficients of subtrajectories in comparison with other techniques in the literature.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Object Trajectory-Based Activity Classification and Recognition Using Hidden Markov Models","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.898960","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4237185/04237188.pdf","startPage":"1912","endPage":"1919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.898960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237188","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Object Trajectory-Based Activity Classification and Recognition Using Hidden Markov Models","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4237188/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9596681","pubMedId":"17605388","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Object Trajectory-Based Activity Classification and Recognition Using Hidden Markov Models","sourcePdf":"16tip07-bashir.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097148S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4237185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"184","xplore-issue":"4237185","articleId":"4237188","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4237190,"authors":[{"name":"Xiujuan Chai","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4237185/4237190/4237190-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiujuan Chai received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2000 and 2002, respectively, where she is currently purusing the Ph.D. degree.","Her research interests include pattern recognition, image processing, face recognition, and biometrics."]},"firstName":"Xiujuan","lastName":"Chai","id":"37391850400"},{"name":"Shiguang Shan","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology and the Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4237185/4237190/4237190-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Shiguang Shan (M'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China, in 2004.","He is currently an Associate Researcher and serves as the Vice Director of the Digital Media Center of the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), CAS.

One of the possible solutions is generating virtual frontal view from any given nonfrontal view to obtain a virtual gallery/probe face. Following this idea, this paper proposes a simple, but efficient, novel locally linear regression (LLR) method, which generates the virtual frontal view from a given nonfrontal face image. We first justify the basic assumption of the paper that there exists an approximate linear mapping between a nonfrontal face image and its frontal counterpart. Then, by formulating the estimation of the linear mapping as a prediction problem, we present the regression-based solution, i.e., globally linear regression. To improve the prediction accuracy in the case of coarse alignment, LLR is further proposed. In LLR, we first perform dense sampling in the nonfrontal face image to obtain many overlapped local patches. Then, the linear regression technique is applied to each small patch for the prediction of its virtual frontal patch. Through the combination of all these patches, the virtual frontal view is generated.

The mutual information is a classical similarity measure which can be used for image registration or change detection.

Image registration and change detection techniques based on bivariate gamma distributions are finally investigated. Simulation results conducted on synthetic and real data are very encouraging.

Hierarchical bidirectional prediction requires buffering frames in the encoder input buffer, thereby contributing to encoder input delay. Long-term frame prediction with pulsed quality requires buffering at the encoder output, increasing the output buffer delay. Both hierarchical B-pictures and pulsed-quality coders involve uneven bit-rate allocation. Both the encoder and decoder buffering requirements depend on the rate allocation. We derive an efficient rate allocation for hierarchical B-pictures using the power spectral density of a wide-sense stationary process. In addition, we discuss important aspects of hierarchical predictive coding, such as the effect of the temporal prediction distance and delay tradeoffs for prediction branch truncation. Finally, we investigate experimentally the tradeoff between delay and compression efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4237185/04237202.pdf","startPage":"1726","endPage":"1740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2007.896681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2007.896681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237185","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compression Efficiency and Delay Tradeoffs for Hierarchical B-Pictures and Pulsed-Quality Frames","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Pulse compression methods","Image coding","Decoding","Filtering","Video compression","Predictive coding","Automatic voltage control","Multimedia communication","TV broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion compensation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video compression","motion compensation accuracy","motion-compensated temporal filtering","prediction branch truncation","temporal prediction distance","hierarchical predictive coding","power spectral density","uneven bit-rate allocation","encoder input delay","encoder input buffer","buffering frames","hierarchical bidirectional prediction","real-time video applications","pulsed-quality frames","hierarchical B-pictures","delay tradeoffs","compression efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bidirectional prediction","end-to-end delay","H.264/AVC","hierarchical B-pictures","motion-compensated temporal filtering (MCTF)","motion compensation accuracy","video compression"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Communication Networks","Data Compression","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Time Factors","Video Recording"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237202/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Compression Efficiency and Delay Tradeoffs for Hierarchical B-Pictures and Pulsed-Quality Frames","volume":"16","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4237202/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9598882","pubMedId":"17605372","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compression Efficiency and Delay Tradeoffs for Hierarchical B-Pictures and Pulsed-Quality Frames","sourcePdf":"16tip07-leontaris.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081213S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4237185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4237185","articleId":"4237202","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4237231,"authors":[{"name":"Lerong Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4237229/4237231/4237231-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lerong Cheng received the B.S. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Zhongshan University, Guangzhou, China, in 2001, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Portland State University, Portland, OR, in 2003.

When evaluating the FPGA architecture, the authors focus on the basic building block of the FPGA, which they refer to as PLB. In order to illustrate the flexibility of their evaluation framework, several unrelated PLB architectures are evaluated in an automated fashion.

In order to meet the tight time-to-market constraints and to effectively handle the design complexity, it is essential to provide a computer-aided design tool support for automating this task. In this paper, we address the issue of ldquoapplication-specific design of optimal crossbar architecturerdquo satisfying the performance requirements of the application and optimal binding of the cores onto the crossbar resources. We present a simulation-based design approach that is based on the analysis of the actual traffic trace of the application, considering local variations in traffic rates, temporal overlap among traffic streams, and criticality of traffic streams. Our approach is physical design aware, where the wiring complexity of the crossbar architecture is also considered during the design process. This leads to detecting timing violations on the wires early in the design cycle and to having accurate estimates of the power consumption on the wires. We apply our methodology onto several MPSoC designs, and the synthesized crossbar platforms are validated for performance by cycle-accurate SystemC simulation of the designs. The crossbar matrix power consumption values are based on the synthesis of the register transfer level models of the designs, obtained using industry standard tools. The experimental case studies show large reduction in communication architecture power consumption (45.3% on average) and total wirelength (38% on average) for the MPSoC designs when compared with traditional design approaches. The synthesized crossbar designs also lead to large reduction in transaction latencies (up to 7 ) when compared with the existing design approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237239/","volume":"26","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4237239/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9591276","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Application-Specific Design Methodology for On-Chip Crossbar Generation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Application-Specific Design Methodology for On-Chip Crossbar Generation","sourcePdf":"26tcad07-murali.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.193596S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4237229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4237229","articleId":"4237239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4237244,"authors":[{"name":"Rutuparna Tamhankar","affiliation":["Semiconductor, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4237229/4237244/4237244-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rutuparna Tamhankar (M'06) received the Bachelor of Electronics Engineering degree from the University of Pune, Pune, India, in 1999, the Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from the West Virginia University, Morgantown, in 2001, and the Engineer's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2005.

A communication-centric design paradigm, networks on chip (NoCs), has been proposed recently to address the communication issues of SoCs. As the geometries of devices approach the physical limits of operation, NoCs will be susceptible to various noise sources such as crosstalk, coupling noise, process variations, etc. Designing systems under such uncertain conditions become a challenge, as it is harder to predict the timing behavior of the system. The use of conservative design methodologies that consider all possible delay variations due to the noise sources, targeting safe system operation under all conditions will result in poor system performance. An aggressive design approach that provides resilience against such timing errors is required for maximizing system performance. In this paper, we present T-error, which is a timing-error-tolerant aggressive design method to design the individual components of the NoC (such as switches, links, and network interfaces), so that the communication subsystem can be clocked at a much higher frequency than a traditional conservative design (up to 1.5x increase in frequency). The NoC is designed to tolerate timing errors that arise from overclocking without substantially affecting the latency for communication. We also present a way to dynamically configure the NoC between the overclocked mode and the normal mode, where the frequency of operation is lower than or equal to the traditional design's frequency, so that the error recovery penalty is completely hidden under normal operation. Experiments on several benchmark applications show large performance improvement (up to 33% reduction in average packet latency) for the proposed system when compared to traditional systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4237229/04237244.pdf","startPage":"1297","endPage":"1310","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2007.891371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2007.891371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing-Error-Tolerant Network-on-Chip Design Methodology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Network-on-a-chip","Design methodology","Delay","Crosstalk","Frequency","System performance","Timing","Wire","System-on-a-chip","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit interconnections","logic design","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","noise sources","NoC","communication-centric design paradigm","SoC","systems-on-chip","system performance","communication architecture","wire delay","timing-error-tolerant aggressive design method","network-on-chip design","error recovery penalty","overclocking","communication subsystem","timing errors","resilience","process variations","coupling noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aggressive design","networks on chip (NoCs)","systems on chip (SoCs)","timing errors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237244/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Timing-Error-Tolerant Network-on-Chip Design Methodology","volume":"26","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4237244/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","accessionNumber":"9591280","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing-Error-Tolerant Network-on-Chip Design Methodology","sourcePdf":"26tcad07-tamhankar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131673S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4237229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4237229","articleId":"4237244","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4237247,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4237229/4237247/4237247-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rui Zhang received the B.S. degree (with honors) in automatic control from University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China, in 2000, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, in 2006.","Currently, she is a Software Engineer with Mentor Graphics Corporation.

Many emerging nanoscale technologies, such as quantum cellular automata (QCA), single electron tunneling (SET), and tunneling phase logic (TPL), are capable of implementing majority or minority logic very efficiently. The main purpose of this paper is to lay the foundation for research on the development of synthesis methodologies and tools to generate optimized majority/minority networks for these emergent technologies. Functionally correct QCA-, SET-, and TPL-based majority/ minority gates have been successfully demonstrated. However, there exists no comprehensive methodology or design automation tool for general multilevel majority/minority network synthesis. We have built the first such tool, majority logic synthesizer, on top of an existing Boolean logic synthesis tool. Experiments with 40 Microelectronics Center of North Carolina benchmarks were performed. They indicate that up to 68.0% reduction in gate count is possible when utilizing majority/minority logic, with the average reduction being 21.9%, compared to traditional logic synthesis, in which two-input and/or gates in the circuit are converted to majority/minority gates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237247/","volume":"26","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4237247/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9591283","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Majority and Minority Network Synthesis With Application to QCA-, SET-, and TPL-Based Nanotechnologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Majority and Minority Network Synthesis With Application to QCA-, SET-, and TPL-Based Nanotechnologies","sourcePdf":"26tcad07-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091512S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4237229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4237229","articleId":"4237247","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4237248,"authors":[{"name":"Lili Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/4237229/4237248/4237248-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lili Zhou (S'03) received the B.S.E.E. and M.S.E.E. degrees from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.

In CASCADE, a system is first partitioned and synthesized using standard 2D design tools to a set of supercells with the same height and varying widths. With this, the 3D design is reduced to 3D supercell placement and 3D-via assignment. A congestion-driven simulated-annealing method is used to find a 3D placement of supercells to minimize the total wire length, the longest wire length, and the number of 3D vias and routing density. To efficiently estimate the routing density of a 3D grid space within the optimization loop, a simple probabilistic congestion model with an incremental congestion computation has been developed. Once the supercell placement is fixed, the problem of assigning 3D vias to accomplish minimal 2D routing densities and uniform 3D-via distribution is solved by an efficient min-cost-max-flow method. The proposed methods have been implemented and tested on a set of ISPD98 circuit benchmarks. Experimental results have shown that the proposed congestion-driven 3D supercell placement and flow-based 3D-via-assignment tools have yielded satisfactory placement with small-area, low-congestion, short-wire-length, few, and uniformly distributed 3D vias. Furthermore, an excellent correlation between routing-density estimation by our model and the actual routing performed by a commercial router has been observed. We have applied the proposed 3D design methodology, tools, and flows to tape out an over 4-million-gate low-density parity-check decoder in a three-tier 0.18- fully depleted silicon-on-insulator 3D CMOS process manufactured by MIT Lincoln Laboratory. The postlayout simulation of this DRC-clean layout design showed an about ten times improvement on the power-delay-area product compared to a 2D implementation in the same process.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2006.888266","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4237229/04237248.pdf","startPage":"1270","endPage":"1282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2006.888266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237229","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CASCADE: A Standard Supercell Design Methodology With Congestion-Driven Placement for Three-Dimensional Interconnect-Heavy Very Large-Scale Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"CASCADE: A Standard Supercell Design Methodology With Congestion-Driven Placement for Three-Dimensional Interconnect-Heavy Very Large-Scale Integrated Circuits","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4237248/","accessionNumber":"9591284","volume":"26","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CASCADE: A Standard Supercell Design Methodology With Congestion-Driven Placement for Three-Dimensional Interconnect-Heavy Very Large-Scale Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"26tcad07-zhou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080404S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4237229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4237229","articleId":"4237248","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4237292,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Bhaya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/4237288/4237292/4237292-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amit Bhaya received the B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, in 1976 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, in 1984 and 1986, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","He is a Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department of the Graduate School of Engineering, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (COPPE/UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

It is based on a radial-basis function neural network with Gaussian activations. In order to improve its tracking capabilities, the radial-basis functions location is partially learnt sweep-by-sweep; the training algorithm is effective, though consistent with real-time applications. This new detection method has been tested on simulated data so as to set the network parameters. Moreover, it has been applied to real recordings obtained from a new neuromonitoring technique which is based on the simultaneous observation of the SEP and of the evoked H-reflex elicited by the same electric stimulus. The SEPs have been extracted using the neural network and the results have then been compared to those obtained by ARX filtering and correlated with the spinal cord integrity information obtained by the H-reflex. The proposed algorithm has been proved to be particularly effective and suitable for single-sweep detection. It is able to track both sudden and smooth signal changes of both amplitude and latency and the needed computational time is moderate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237344/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9598869","pubMedId":"17605361","volume":"54","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4237344/","publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluation and Application of a RBF Neural Network for Online Single-Sweep Extraction of SEPs During Scoliosis Surgery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation and Application of a RBF Neural Network for Online Single-Sweep Extraction of SEPs During Scoliosis Surgery","sourcePdf":"54tbme07-merzagora.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121511S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4237327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4237327","articleId":"4237344","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4237349,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Quan Shen","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4237327/4237349/4237349-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai-Quan Shen received the B.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China.

Mean spike amplitude, mean firing rate, median interspike interval (ISI), mean burst rate, and correlation index were analyzed and compared to morphological features. Synchronized bursting was highly correlated with neuronal clustering and process fasciculation. Spike amplitude was negatively correlated with thin branching which was most evident in neurons grown on PEI. These data indicate that factors, which influence adherence of neurons to surfaces, can profoundly impact both neuronal network morphology and electrophysiological activity in vitro.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2006.889195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2006.889195","startPage":"1309","endPage":"1320","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4237327/04237350.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237327","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuronal Network Morphology and Electrophysiologyof Hippocampal Neurons Cultured on Surface-Treated Multielectrode Arrays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2007","displayDocTitle":"Neuronal Network Morphology and Electrophysiologyof Hippocampal Neurons Cultured on Surface-Treated Multielectrode Arrays","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","volume":"54","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237350/","accessionNumber":"9596670","pubMedId":"17605362","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237350/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuronal Network Morphology and Electrophysiologyof Hippocampal Neurons Cultured on Surface-Treated Multielectrode Arrays","sourcePdf":"54tbme07-soussou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104448S","chronDate":"July  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4237327","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4237327","articleId":"4237350","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4237356,"authors":[{"name":"Andrea Agnes","affiliation":["Department of Electrics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Agnes","id":"37688101500"},{"name":"Alessandro Cabrini","affiliation":["Department of Electrics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Cabrini","id":"37272735500"},{"name":"Franco Maloberti","affiliation":["Department of Electrics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Maloberti","id":"37269864600"},{"name":"Giuseppe Martini","affiliation":["Department of Electrics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Martini","id":"37364588200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"4237356","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1697},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise cancellation","Choppers","Semiconductor device noise","Low-frequency noise","Broadband amplifiers","Clocks","Frequency","Circuit noise","Noise reduction","Analog circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["1/f noise","choppers (circuits)","circuit noise","circuit simulation","circuit stability","instrumentation amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifier noise","instrument amplifiers","analog circuits","modified chopping control","chopping frequency","chopper stabilized technique","1/f noise cancellation","amplifier offset cancellation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplifier noise","analog circuits","noise","instrument amplifiers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237356","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2007.891758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2007.891758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237355","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4237355/04237356.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cancellation of Amplifier Offset and - Noise: An Improved Chopper Stabilized Technique","abstract":"In this brief, a theoretical analysis on the limits of conventional chopper stabilization technique is presented and a solution conceived to improve the amplifier performance is proposed.

Whereas several code-specific decoders have been proposed in the literature, the implementation of a high performance yet flexible LDPC decoder still is a challenging topic. This work presents a novel formulation of the decoding algorithm that strongly simplifies internal communication requirements and enables the development of decoders supporting generally defined LDPC codes.

The feedthrough logic (FTL) allows for a partial evaluation in a computational block before its input signals are valid, and does a quick final evaluation as soon as the inputs arrive. The FTL is well suited to arithmetic circuits where the critical path is made of a large cascade of inverting gates. Furthermore, FTL based circuits perform better in high fanout and high switching frequencies due to both lower delay and dynamic power consumption. Experimental results, for practical circuits, demonstrate that low-power FTL provides for smaller propagation time delay (4.1 times), lower energy consumption (35.6%), and similar combined delay, power consumption and active area product (0.7% worst), while providing lower sensitivity to power supply, temperature, capacitive load and process variations than the standard CMOS technologies.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express

The MOS transistor operation in the moderate inversion region becomes especially important in multichannel readout systems where limited power dissipation is required. The ENC of a CSA followed by a fast shaper is usually dominated by the voltage noise of the input MOS transistor. We carried out noise minimization for such a CSA, searching for an optimum input transistor width. The analyses were made using a simplified EKV model and were compared to HSPICE simulations using a BSIM3v3 model. We considered several CMOS technology generations with minimum transistor gate length ranging from 0.13 mum to 0.8 mum. We studied the sensitivity of ENC to the input transistor width, and propose a simple formula to estimate the optimum transistor width, which is valid in a wide current density range.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4237412/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591601","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"54","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Noise Optimization of Charge Amplifiers With MOS Input Transistors Operating in Moderate Inversion Region for Short Peaking Times","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Optimization of Charge Amplifiers With MOS Input Transistors Operating in Moderate Inversion Region for Short Peaking Times","sourcePdf":"54tns03-grybos-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069905S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4237381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"4237381","articleId":"4237412","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4237442,"authors":[{"name":"Lawrence M.

A fleet of interdiction vehicles are available to chase, and attempt to interdict, vehicles that set off a sensor alarm. In our model, the government chooses the thickness (in terms of number of sensors) of the radiation wall, the neutron threshold in the sensors, and the number of interdiction vehicles to minimize the expected damage inflicted by a terrorist, subject to a budget constraint on sensors and interdiction vehicles. The terrorist observes the wall thickness and at each node he updates his likelihood of passing through a sensor without triggering an alarm and decides whether to proceed through the sensor or stop and detonate the bomb. Our results suggest that for an annual cost ranging from several million dollars to several tens of millions of dollars, depending upon the city's roadway topology, a single layer of sensors placed tens of miles from the city center and 10-20 dedicated interdiction vehicles could mitigate the damage from an unshielded or lightly-shielded plutonium weapon, but not from a uranium weapon or a radiological dispersal device.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237442/","volume":"54","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4237442/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591616","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"The Last Line of Defense: Designing Radiation Detection-Interdiction Systems to Protect Cities From a Nuclear Terrorist Attack","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Last Line of Defense: Designing Radiation Detection-Interdiction Systems to Protect Cities From a Nuclear Terrorist Attack","sourcePdf":"54tns03-wein-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068415S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4237381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4237381","articleId":"4237442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4237459,"authors":[{"name":"Khairi Ashour Hamdi","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Khairi Ashour","lastName":"Hamdi","id":"37297892800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"4237459","dbTime":"36 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":650},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Fading","Random variables","Wireless communication","Distributed computing","Polynomials","Integral equations","Performance analysis","Probability density function","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference (signal)","Nakagami channels","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arbitrary random variables","unified analytical method","interference analysis","Nakagami fading"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cochannel interference","fading channels"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a unified analytical method for computing the average E[g(x/(Sigma\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k=1</sub>\n \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</sup>\n y\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</sub>\n + b))] of some arbitrary function g(.) when x is a gamma random variable and independent of the arbitrary random variables y\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n, y\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n, ..., y\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</sub>\n.

We consider an asynchronous multirate convolutional coded DS-CDMA system that communicates over quasi-static flat Rayleigh fading channels. The proposed receiver is derived within the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) framework in connection with the noise-splitting approach. The used theoretical framework guarantees convergence of the receiver, as opposed to many other iterative receiver structures. Furthermore, the noise-splitting approach provides a set of noise-weighting coefficients that can be optimized under weak constraints. The inputs to the single-user decoders are linear combinations of two kinds of soft values with weights determined by the noise-weighting coefficients. These two kinds of soft values can be interpreted as a priori information and extrinsic information, respectively, if the channels are known. In the case of unknown channels, they are asymptotically a priori and asymptotically extrinsic, i.e., they become a priori and extrinsic when the length of the observed frame tends to infinity. In most cases, the optimum coefficients lead to extrinsic or asymptotically extrinsic values fed to the input of the single-user decoders. Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed receiver is resistant to channel estimation errors and supports high system loads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation, Partial Successive Interference Cancellation, and Data Decoding for DS-CDMA Based on the SAGE Algorithm","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.898855","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4237446/04237463.pdf","startPage":"1231","endPage":"1241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.898855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237463/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","displayDocTitle":"Joint Channel Estimation, Partial Successive Interference Cancellation, and Data Decoding for DS-CDMA Based on the SAGE Algorithm","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4237463/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591573","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Channel Estimation, Partial Successive Interference Cancellation, and Data Decoding for DS-CDMA Based on the SAGE Algorithm","sourcePdf":"55tcomm06-kocian.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074537S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4237446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4237446","articleId":"4237463","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4237464,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaobei Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Xiaobei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37423197700"},{"name":"Chao Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Lu","id":"37280494400"},{"name":"Tee Hiang Cheng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Tee Hiang","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37306573700"},{"name":"Soo Ngee Koh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Soo Ngee","lastName":"Koh","id":"37283913800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"4237464","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"A simplified parallel step-by-step decoding algorithm is proposed for decoding Reed-Solomon (RS) codes.

For high-rate and short-range transmission, direct sequence based ultra-wideband (DS-UWB) systems are a strong contender for consumer market applications. Due to the large transmission bandwidth, the UWB channel is characterized by a long root-mean-square delay spread and the RAKE receiver cannot always overcome the resulting intersymbol interference. We therefore study equalization for DS-UWB systems. This paper is comprised of two parts. In this first part, we consider DS-UWB with binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation, which is the mandatory transmission mode for DS-UWB systems promoted by the UWB Forum industry alliance. We derive matched filter bounds for optimum equalization taking into account practical constraints like receiver filtering, sampling, and the number of RAKE fingers when RAKE preprocessing is applied at the receiver. Our results show that chip-rate sampling is sufficient for close-to-optimum performance. For analysis of suboptimum equalization strategies we further study the distribution of the zeros of the channel transfer function including RAKE combining. Our findings suggest that linear equalization is well suited for the lower data rate modes of DS-UWB systems, whereas nonlinear equalization is preferable for high-data rate modes. Moreover, we devise equalization schemes with widely linear processing, which improve performance while not increasing equalizer complexity. Simulation and numerical results confirm the significance of our analysis and equalizer designs and show that low-complexity (widely) linear and nonlinear equalizers perform close to the pertinent matched filter bound limit.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.898836","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4237446/04237472.pdf","startPage":"1164","endPage":"1173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.898836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equalization for DS-UWB Systems\u2014Part I: BPSK Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237472/","displayDocTitle":"Equalization for DS-UWB Systems\u2014Part I: BPSK Modulation","volume":"55","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591579","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237472/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equalization for DS-UWB Systems\u2014Part I: BPSK Modulation","sourcePdf":"55tcomm06-parihar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066863S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4237446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4237446","articleId":"4237472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4237473,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Young Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA","School of Information Technology, Kangwon University, Chuncheon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4237446/4237473/4237473-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seung Young Park (S'97-M'03) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 1997, 1999, and 2002, respectively.","From April 2003 to December 2005, he was with Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Kiheung, Korea, where he was a Senior Engineer, working on several projects in the field of next-generation wireless mobile communications.

This gain can be exploited by scheduling the users with the best current channel conditions. However, this kind of scheduling requires that the base station (or access point) knows some kind of channel quality indicator (CQI) information for every user in the system. When the wireless link lacks channel reciprocity, each user must feed back this CQI information to the base station. The required feedback load makes exploiting multiuser diversity extremely difficult when the number of users becomes large. To alleviate this problem, this paper considers a contention-based CQI feedback where only users whose channel gains are larger than a threshold are allowed to transmit their CQI information through a spread-spectrum based contention channel. Considering the capture effect in this contention channel, it is shown that i) the multiuser diversity gain can be exploited regardless of the number of transmit antennas at the base station and ii) the total system throughput exponentially approaches that of the full feedback scheme as the spreading code length of the contention channel linearly increases. In addition, it is also shown that multiuser diversity can be maintained with the feedback delay of time-variant channels. We also consider the issue of differentiated rate scheduling, in which the base station gives different rates to different subsets of mobiles. In this scenario, mobiles feed back their CQI with some access probability, and we show this technique causes only a negligible throughput loss compared to the case without supporting differentiated rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4237446/04237473.pdf","startPage":"1174","endPage":"1190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.898839","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.898839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237446","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Scheduling for Multiple-Antenna Wireless Networks Using Contention-Based Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Feedback","Base stations","Throughput","Multiuser detection","Diversity methods","Femtocell networks","Spread spectrum communication","Antenna feeds","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","mobile radio","scheduling","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling","multiple antenna wireless networks","contention based feedback","multiuser diversity gain","current channel conditions","channel quality indicator","wireless link","feedback load"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel quality indicator","contention channel","CQI","feedback","multiuser diversity","opportunistic communication","random access","spread spectrum"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"On Scheduling for Multiple-Antenna Wireless Networks Using Contention-Based Feedback","volume":"55","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4237473/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591580","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Scheduling for Multiple-Antenna Wireless Networks Using Contention-Based Feedback","sourcePdf":"55tcomm06-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078292S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4237446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4237446","articleId":"4237473","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4237477,"authors":[{"name":"Yuh-Ren Tsai","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/4237446/4237477/4237477-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuh-Ren Tsai (M'01) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1994.","From 1994 to 2001, he was a Researcher in Telecommunication Laboratories of Chunghwa Telecom Co., Ltd., Taiwan.

In order to achieve higher rates or to support multiple access capabilities, direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) techniques have been introduced to UWB systems, and multiple pulses corresponding to a certain pseudo-noise (PN) code are transmitted to represent a symbol. In addition, the concept of M-ary code shift keying (M-CSK) was introduced into DSSS systems to achieve higher rates. In this work, we propose an M-CSK modulation technique based on the large set of Kasami sequences since it possesses good code properties, including a large code set size and low cross correlations. The modulation and demodulation schemes are developed, and the system performance in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and UWB channels exposed to multiple user interference is investigated thoroughly. It was found that the Kasami M-CSK modulation is superior to other M-CSK modulation schemes in the bandwidth efficiency, and therefore a higher data rate can be achieved.

The goal is to provide a family of RC codes to achieve high throughput in hybrid automatic repeat request (ARQ) scheme for high-speed data packet wireless systems. As a subclass of low-density parity-check codes, IRA codes have an extremely simple encoder and a low-complexity decoder while providing capacity approaching performance. We focus on a hybrid design method which employs both puncturing and extending. We propose a simple puncturing method based on minimizing the maximal recoverable step of the punctured nodes. We also propose a new extending scheme for IRA codes by introducing the degree-1 parity bits for the lower rate codes and obtaining the optimal proportions of extended nodes through density evolution analysis. The throughput performance of the designed RC-IRA codes in hybrid ARQ is evaluated for both AWGN and block fading channels. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed RC codes offer good error correction performance over a wide rate range and provide high throughput, especially in the high and low signal-to-noise ratio regions.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2007.898834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2007.898834","startPage":"1153","endPage":"1163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/4237446/04237479.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237446","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Rate-Compatible Irregular Repeat Accumulate Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Design of Rate-Compatible Irregular Repeat Accumulate Codes","volume":"55","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9591585","publicationDate":"June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4237479/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Rate-Compatible Irregular Repeat Accumulate Codes","sourcePdf":"55tcomm06-yue.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06779S","chronDate":"June  2007","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"4237446","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4237446","articleId":"4237479","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4237496,"authors":[{"name":"Rei-Fu Huang","affiliation":["MediaTek, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan","National Tsing Hua University"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/54/4237480/4237496/4237496-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rei-Fu Huang is a senior engineer at Media Tek in Hsinchu City, Taiwan.

The yield of such a large chip is usually too low to be profitable. Therefore, yield enhancement is an important issue in SoC product development. Memory cores usually occupy a large proportion of the area of a typical SoC, and they normally have higher circuit density, so they tend to dominate SoC yield. This article presents cost and benefit models to evaluate the economic effectiveness of typical memory BISR implementations.

However, much of industry validation hinges on the latter skills. Validation is something that does not get noticed when done well, but everyone notices when something goes wrong - such as the infamous Pentium floating-point division bug. Major semiconductor companies experience postsilicon validation turning into a very expensive, time-consuming proposition, yet very few college graduates are formally trained in the area. Validation is the activity of ensuring a product satisfies its reference specifications, runs with relevant software and hardware, and meets user expectations. Here, I discuss some of the key challenges to successful validation and show why a radical transformation is necessary if validation is to be effective in the near future.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/54/4237480/04237500.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Design & Test of Computers","doi":"10.1109/MDT.2007.54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDT.2007.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237480","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the cusp of a validation wall","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit testing","Computer bugs","Debugging","Logic","Silicon","Observability","Computer architecture","Energy management","Fasteners","Turning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","formal verification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["postsilicon validation","product specifications","reference specifications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["validation wall","logic","low DPM","virtual platform","modular validation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"On the cusp of a validation wall","volume":"24","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4237500/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 2007","accessionNumber":"9687086","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the cusp of a validation wall","sourcePdf":"d2193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051066S","chronDate":"March-April  2007","xplore-pub-id":"54","isNumber":"4237480","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"54","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4237480","articleId":"4237500","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4237512,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Our investigations show that the error caused by the difference between down converters, has a significant effect on the beamformer performance. It is shown that the RF-IF chain phase and amplitude errors have a more significant effect on the beamformer performance than the other errors. Because of the higher sensitivity of the phase of the received signal, phase error has the most significant effect.","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2006.372190","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4237510/4237511/04237512.pdf","startPage":"596","endPage":"600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2006.372190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of the Undesired RF-IF Chain Effects on the LS-CMA based Beamformer in CDMA Mobile Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237512","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237512/","displayDocTitle":"Impact of the Undesired RF-IF Chain Effects on the LS-CMA based Beamformer in CDMA Mobile Communications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9771734","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237512/","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of the Undesired RF-IF Chain Effects on the LS-CMA based Beamformer in CDMA Mobile Communications","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067112S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4237537,"authors":[{"name":"Manoj Tripathy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Manoj","lastName":"Tripathy","id":"37301125900"},{"name":"R.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique is used for selecting optimal value of PNN parameter. An algorithm has been developed around the theme of the conventional differential protection of transformer. It makes use of ratio of voltage to frequency and amplitude of differential current for the determination of operating conditions of the transformer. For the evaluation of the algorithm, relaying signals for various operating conditions of a transformer, including internal and external faults and inrush conditions, were simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC. The results amply demonstrate the capability of the proposed algorithm in terms of accuracy and speed. The algorithm has been implemented in MATLAB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237537/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9771774","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237537/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization Based Probabilistic Neural Network for Power Transformer Protection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization Based Probabilistic Neural Network for Power Transformer Protection","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077003S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4237539,"authors":[{"name":"Prerana Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Computer Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India"],"firstName":"Prerana","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37691871900"},{"name":"D.

However, OFDM is more prone to time selective fading as compared to single carrier systems. Rapid time variations destroy the subcarrier orthogonality and introduce inter-carrier interference (ICI). Besides this, obtaining reliable channel estimates for receiver equalization is a non-trivial task in rapidly fading systems. In our work, we have addressed the problem of channel estimation and ICI suppression by viewing the system as a state space model. Kalman filter is employed to estimate the channel; this is followed by a time domain ICI mitigation filter which maximizes the SINR (signal to interference plus noise ratio). This method is seen to provide significant SINR gain with low training overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kalman Filter based Channel Estimation and ICI Suppression for High Mobility OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2006.372217","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4237510/4237511/04237539.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2006.372217","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237539/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Kalman Filter based Channel Estimation and ICI Suppression for High Mobility OFDM Systems","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237539/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9771777","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kalman Filter based Channel Estimation and ICI Suppression for High Mobility OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07003S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4237545,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The control scheme uses only one current sensor for each motor to measure the DC bus feedback current instead of two current sensors for three phase currents of each motor. Three position hall sensors are used for each motor to perform the six-step commutation technique instead of expensive decoder. Each motor speed is estimated and calculated based on hall sensors signals instead of tachometer.

For spreading sequence, some portion of the long m-sequence generated from the primitive polynomial is used. This sequence doesn't hold good in terms of properties and performance. To employ better spreading sequences, the gold sequences generated from the preferred pairs are also applied for the performance evaluation and comparison.

The proposed two step process uses a direct computation Hopfield neural network to generate economic dispatch (ED). Then using dynamic programming (DP) the generator schedule is produced. The method employs a linear input-output model for neurons. Formulations for solving the UC problems are explored. Through the application of these formulations, direct computation instead of iterations for solving the problems becomes possible. However, it has been found that the UC problem cannot be tackled accurately within the framework of the conventional Hopfield network. Not like the usual Hopfield methods which select the weighting factors of the energy function by trials, the proposed method determines the corresponding factor using formulation calculation. Hence, it is relatively easy to apply the proposed method. The effectiveness of the developed method is identified through its application to 10 and 20 unit systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237575/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9771841","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237575/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A New Dynamic Programming Based Hopfield Neural Network to Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Dynamic Programming Based Hopfield Neural Network to Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-64.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084997S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237575","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4237590,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The idea of proposed scheme is based on the third decomposition of the measured signals (three line currents) at each relay location using the db4 mother wavelet. Thereafter, third level approximation coefficients (CA3) are reconstructed and used for deriving operating and restraining quantities. Based on extensive simulations it has been found that the operating quantity is the absolute value of the difference of third level reconstructed signal (A3) for each phase. The restraining quantity is one third of the absolute value of the summation of third level reconstructed signal for each phase. The wavelet transform is used to capture important features of the decomposed signal that are sensitive to high resistance fault and provides proper discrimination between external and internal faults. The proposed scheme has been tested under different fault and system conditions. A series of test using PSCAD/EMTDC output data in a 400 kV tapped transmission lines have proved the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet Transform Based Differential Protection Scheme for Tapped Transmission Line","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2006.372269","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4237510/4237511/04237591.pdf","startPage":"1004","endPage":"1008","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2006.372269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237591","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237591/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet Transform Based Differential Protection Scheme for Tapped Transmission Line","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237591/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9771866","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet Transform Based Differential Protection Scheme for Tapped Transmission Line","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-80.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054541S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4237604,"authors":[{"name":"V.

The fault diagnosis is done by identifying the parameters of the system from the measurement of state variables of the system. The input excitation for the system is unit step and the artificial neural network which identifies the parameters of the system is trained using Widrow-Hoff training rule. The system is identified in discrete domain by using the state variables of the system at to consecutive sampling instants in a recursive procedure. The faults are introduced arbitrarily and the neural network identifies the parameter continuously from the measurement of state variables. The proposed method is feasible for on line fault diagnosis through digital implementation.

This paper presents a comparison study of fuzzy logic and fast output sampling based power system stabilizer (PSS) for stability enhancement, speed deviation (Deltaomega) and acceleration (Deltaomega) of the rotor of synchronous generator of single machine power system were taken as the input to the fuzzy logic controller. These variables take significant effects on damping on damping of the generator shaft mechanical oscillations. The stabilizing signals were computed using the fuzzy membership functions depending on these variables. The simulations were tested under cetriod de-fuzzyfication methods. In fast output sampling technique, the nonlinear model of single-machine system is linearized at different operating points and a linear state space model is obtained. For this model, a common state feedback gain is obtained using LMI technique. A robust fast output sampling feedback gain which realizes output injection gain is obtained using LMI approach. This method does not require states of the system for feedback and is easily implementable. This robust fast output sampling control is applied to non-linear model of a single machine system at different operating (equilibrium) points. These simulation results are quite encouraging and satisfactory.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2006.372298","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4237510/4237511/04237620.pdf","startPage":"1031","endPage":"1036","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2006.372298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Robust Fuzzy Logic and Fast output sampling feedback based Power System Stabilizer for SMIB","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Robust Fuzzy Logic and Fast output sampling feedback based Power System Stabilizer for SMIB","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4237620/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9771921","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237620/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Robust Fuzzy Logic and Fast output sampling feedback based Power System Stabilizer for SMIB","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063991S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4237624,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Abbasian","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Abbasian","id":"37546033800"},{"name":"J.

The paper describes the main idea of the CSANN method and three possible structures of the CSANN network designed for three classes of production cases. CSANN itself finds and optimizes feasible solutions of the production schedules considering the sequence and resource constraints. CSANN network works together with three heuristics algorithms: the first one eliminates dead lock situations, the second one eliminates empty periods of time without any operation on any machine, the third one obtains a new set of the initial value needed for iterations. The structure of CSANN has been adopted for a class of production cases. The first structure has been designed for the solving serial flow production case without groups of technologically changeable machines and has been originated from literature. The second structure has been created by authors and it is able to solve serial production cases with groups of technologically changeable machines. The third structure also has been built by authors and is able to solve parallel production cases without groups of technologically changeable machines. The paper presents results of computer experiments proceeded for second and third class of production cases. The results of experiment achieved for the serial flow production case with groups of technologically changeable machines are compared with results achieved by other method - genetic algorithm AGHAR. Authors point in the paper that it seems to be possible to develop the CSANN further so the optimization of more complicated processes will be possible.

This approach helps in voltage sag compensation through reactive power control using series part of unified power quality conditioner, generally termed as UPQC-Q. Thus utility sag compensation can effectively be done without utilizing any active power from source or from inverter side. Moreover, this quadrature voltage injection during voltage sag compensation also helps to improve the source side power factor, which results in reduced shunt active power filter (APF) loading. The voltage harmonic compensation based on d-q transformation simultaneously with voltage sag compensation is also presented. The simulation results based on MATLAB / SIMULINK are discussed to validate the theory presented in the paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Control Approach for Unified Power Quality Conditioner Q without Active Power Injection for Voltage Sag Compensation","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2006.372356","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4237510/4237511/04237678.pdf","startPage":"779","endPage":"784","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2006.372356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237678","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237678/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Control Approach for Unified Power Quality Conditioner Q without Active Power Injection for Voltage Sag Compensation","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237678/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9772100","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Control Approach for Unified Power Quality Conditioner Q without Active Power Injection for Voltage Sag Compensation","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051258S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4237708,"authors":[{"name":"Hemant A.

Important advantages of this ecologically friendly technology are that there is no systematical requirement for maintenance as well as the possibility to adjust bearing parameters to various operating conditions. The most significant drawback of AMB-technology is that even a single failure within one sub-assembly may cause a break down of the bearing load capacity. The risk of an unintentional machine standstill combined with the resulting costs is one major reason that the broad industrial acceptance of active magnetic bearings is quite low at the time. To increase AMB reliability at reduced costs a new AMB concept has been developed by the authors. It comprises a highly integrated DSP controller and a reliable switching amplifier (RSA) along with a spatial and galvanic isolation between the digital controller and the signal conditioning circuitry from the power units. To investigate the increase in reliability using the RSA instead of standard industrial switching amplifier an analysis of the RSA as well as a comparison with industrial switching amplifier concepts is presented in this paper. Considered are the failure rates of the individual components and sub-circuits, the circuit topologies as well as different maintenance strategies. It is shown that the mean time to failure (MTTF) of the RSA is up to a factor of 21 higher compared with conventional industrial switching amplifier concepts.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic analysis","Magnetic switching","Magnetic levitation","Integrated circuit reliability","Maintenance","Costs","Lubricants","Friction","Digital signal processing","Switching circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["magnetic bearings","reliability","structural engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability analysis","active magnetic bearings","reliable switching amplifier","circuit topologies","mean time to failure"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2006.372440","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4237510/4237511/04237762.pdf","startPage":"1460","endPage":"1465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2006.372440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reliability Analysis of Switching Amplifier Concepts for Active Magnetic Bearings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Reliability Analysis of Switching Amplifier Concepts for Active Magnetic Bearings","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237762/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237762/","accessionNumber":"9771958","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reliability Analysis of Switching Amplifier Concepts for Active Magnetic Bearings","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04821S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4237769,"authors":[{"name":"Pradeep K.

The design of filters largely depends on the a-priori knowledge about the type of noise. Due to this, standard filters are application and image specific. Widely used filtering algorithms reduce noisy artifacts by smoothing. However, this operation normally results in smoothing of the edges as well. On the other hand, sharpening filters enhance the high frequency details making the image non-smooth. An integrated general approach to design a finite impulse response filter based on principal component neural network (PCNN) is proposed in this study for image filtering, optimized in the sense of visual inspection and error metric. This algorithm exploits the inter-pixel correlation by iteratively updating the filter coefficients using PCNN. This algorithm performs optimal smoothing of the noisy image by preserving high and low frequency features. Evaluation results show that the proposed filter is robust under various noise distributions. Further, the number of unknown parameters is very few and most of these parameters are adaptively obtained from the processed image.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237769/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9771979","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237769/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design of a FIR Filter for Image Restoration using Principal Component Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a FIR Filter for Image Restoration using Principal Component Neural Networks","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060947S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237769","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4237786,"authors":[{"name":"Niusha Shafiabady","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Azad University Science and Research center, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Niusha","lastName":"Shafiabady","id":"37595509500"},{"name":"M.

This paper discusses various renewal energy sources available in the environment that can be tapped to supply energy for these wireless sensors. This paper has special interest on piezoelectric generator because it is simple and easy to harvest mechanical force energy from human beings as compared to other energy sources. An energy harvesting circuit design for piezoelectric pushbutton-generator is proposed and implemented efficiently for wireless radio frequency (RF) transmitter. This self-powered wireless transmitter is capable of transmitting a 12-bit digital word information using the mechanical force energy harvested from depressing the pushbutton which is attached to the energy harvesting circuit. The experimental results show that when the piezoelectric pushbutton is depressed, 67.61 muJ of electrical energy is scavenged and it is sufficient to transmit 2 complete 12-bit digital word information via the RF unit. The RF unit consumes 26.4 muJ of energy for 1 word transmission.","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2006.372517","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4237510/4237511/04237839.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2006.372517","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","startPage":"1711","endPage":"1716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Harvesting using Piezoelectric Igniter for Self-Powered Radio Frequency (RF) Wireless Sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Energy Harvesting using Piezoelectric Igniter for Self-Powered Radio Frequency (RF) Wireless Sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237839/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237839/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9772111","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Harvesting using Piezoelectric Igniter for Self-Powered Radio Frequency (RF) Wireless Sensors","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056056S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4237849,"authors":[{"name":"Debasish Patnaik","affiliation":["Electrical & Electronics Department, BIT Mesra Ranchi"],"firstName":"Debasish","lastName":"Patnaik","id":"37691292100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0725-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0726-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4237849","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":326},"abstract":"Use of Computer Tomography(CT) , Magnetic Resonance (MR), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) techniques in biomedical imaging has revolutionized the process of medical diagnosis in recent years.

On the basis of review of research papers published earlier in the area of image fusion, this paper presents a method of image fusion based on Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT) and Self Organizing Feature Mapping(SOFM) neural network. The proposed method is a feature level fusion method.2-dimensional DWT is used to decompose the images into various details at different levels to extract useful features and SOFM neural network is used to recognize complementary features. These features are then integrated using a criteria based on activity level. Final fused image is constructed from fused feature set. The proposed method of fusion has been applied to MR, SPECT and CT scan images, and results obtained are presented in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4237510/4237511/04237849.pdf","startPage":"1189","endPage":"1194","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2006.372527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2006.372527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237511","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biomedical Image Fusion Using Wavelet Transforms and SOFM Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","Wavelet transforms","Neural networks","Image fusion","Medical diagnosis","Computed tomography","Discrete wavelet transforms","Biomedical computing","Optical computing","Magnetic resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","discrete wavelet transforms","feature extraction","image fusion","medical image processing","self-organising feature maps","single photon emission computed tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical image fusion","self organizing feature mapping neural network","computer tomography technique","magnetic resonance technique","single photon emission computed tomography technique","biomedical imaging","medical diagnosis","discrete wavelet transform","feature level fusion method","feature extraction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Biomedical Image Fusion Using Wavelet Transforms and SOFM Neural Network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237849/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9772124","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biomedical Image Fusion Using Wavelet Transforms and SOFM Neural Network","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042935S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237849","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4237886,"authors":[{"name":"Suresh S.

This paper investigates and designs an optimal classifier using a radial basis function (RBF) NN. Authors compare the performance of two NN configurations, namely a well-known MLP NN model and the proposed RBF NN model on the radar dataset collected from the published studies. It is shown that the proposed RBF NN, consistently, has 100% accuracy on \"bad\" instances and 99.1935% accuracy on \"good\" instances. The results show that the proposed RBF NN classifier clearly outperforms the MLP NN one in various performance measures such as MSE, NMSE, correlation coefficients, area under the ROC curve and classification accuracy on the testing datasets even after attempting different data partitions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Ionosphere","Databases","Testing","Backpropagation algorithms","Radar measurements","Radar antennas","Phased arrays","Multilayer perceptrons","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptrons","pattern classification","radar computing","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RBF neural network","optimal classifier","radar returns classification","multilayer perceptron","radial basis function","data partitions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification","Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network","backpropagation algorithm","Radial Basis Function Neural Network","Receiver Operating Characteristics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2006.372564","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4237510/4237511/04237886.pdf","startPage":"2043","endPage":"2048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2006.372564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RBF Neural Network based Model as an Optimal Classifier for the Classification of Radar Returns from the Ionosphere","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"RBF Neural Network based Model as an Optimal Classifier for the Classification of Radar Returns from the Ionosphere","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237886/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237886/","accessionNumber":"9772165","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RBF Neural Network based Model as an Optimal Classifier for the Classification of Radar Returns from the Ionosphere","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-375.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055772S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-19"},{"_id":4237894,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A cost effective Hall-effect current sensor, which does not interfere with the process, has been used for acquiring motor current signature during drilling under different cutting conditions. A more advanced signal processing technique, wavelet packet transform has been implemented on the acquired current signature to extract features which are more sensitive to drill wear and less sensitive to the process conditions.

In this paper, four strategies for induction motor speed control are proposed. Those four strategies are based on PSO and called maximum efficiency strategy, minimum stator current strategy, maximum power factor strategy, and maximum weighted cost strategy. The proposed technique is based on the principle that the flux level in a machine can be adjusted to give the minimum amount of losses and minimum operating cost for a given value of speed and load torque. The main advantages of the proposed technique are; its simple structure and its straightforward maximization of induction motor efficiency and its operating cost for a given load torque. As will be demonstrated, PSO is so efficient in finding the optimum operating machine's flux level. The optimum flux level is a function of the machine load and speed requirements. Simulation results show that a considerable energy and cost savings is achieved in comparison with the conventional method of operation under the condition of constant voltage to frequency ratio and field oriented control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237917/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9771742","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237917/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal Operation of Induction Motors Using Artificial Neural Network Based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Operation of Induction Motors Using Artificial Neural Network Based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-406.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052877S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4237959,"authors":[{"name":"Kailiang Wu","affiliation":["Department of information Science and Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Kailiang","lastName":"Wu","id":"37694566900"},{"name":"Bin Dai","affiliation":["Department of information Science and Engineering, University of Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Dai","id":"37688788000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0725-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0726-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4237959","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4237959","abstract":"Golden week is a collection of national holidays within seven days.

The former is implemented by software using Nios II embedded processor due to the need of the complicated control algorithm and low sampling frequency control (motion trajectory & position control: less than 1kHz). The latter is implemented by hardware using PLD (programmable logic device) in FPGA due to the need of high sampling frequency control (current loop: 16kHz, PWM circuit: 4~8MHz) but simple computation. Furthermore, to improve the control accuracy of the table positioning, a full closed-loop control, which the signal of linear encoder is feed-backed for position control, is considered.

Pilot based techniques have normally been employed for channel estimation. However, for time varying channels, pilot symbols need to be transmitted periodically to overcome the effect of time selective fading. Expectation-maximization (EM) based technique may be used in such situations avoiding the need for periodic retransmission of pilot symbols. In order to reduce the complexity of EM algorithm, we propose an EM-MMSE based iterative procedure to estimate the time-varying channel.

Whenever an image is converted from one form to another, such as, digitizing, scanning, transmitting, storing, etc., some form of degradation occurs at the output. Hence, the output image has to undergo a process called image enhancement which consists of a collection of techniques that seek to improve the visual appearance of an image. In this paper, a classical spatial filter, neural network (NN), cellular neural network (CNN) and fuzzy filters are presented for the noise reduction of images that are corrupted with additive noise. A three layer neural network is trained for few test images and is used to filter the corrupted colour images. A single layer CNN is developed to reduce the noise in the colour image and compared with that of the classical spatial filter. A new fuzzy filter technique is studied with respect to noisy gray scale images. All the techniques produce convincing results when applied to additive (Gaussian) noisy images. Experimental results are obtained based on the mathematical models of expert systems and compared by numerical measures and visual inspection. It is envisaged to train CNN using gradient descent back-propagation algorithm for better results and extend fuzzy filter technique to reduce noise in colour images.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237993/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9772044","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237993/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Image Enhancement Techniques: Classical Spatial Filter, Neural Network, Cellular Neural Network, and Fuzzy Filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Image Enhancement Techniques: Classical Spatial Filter, Neural Network, Cellular Neural Network, and Fuzzy Filter","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050307S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4237996,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An efficient control scheme is required to ensure the best use of TCSC. Conventional control strategies are based on approximate linearized model with fixed structures and parameters. But in fact, the nature of a power system not only is highly nonlinear but also exhibits some kind of uncertainty. In this paper, a robust feedback linearization controller is designed for this purpose. First, a suitable diffeomorphism transformation is used to linearize the nominal model. Then, a recursive method is used to complete the adaptive control law. The obtained controller can stabilize the uncertain system if the value of the uncertain parameter belongs to a presupposed closed region. Two different faults have been applied in the system. A symmetrical three-phase short-circuit fault which occurs at the generator bus and at the midpoint of the transmission line as well as a sudden load removing fault are applied. By using computer simulation of different operating conditions and disturbances, the effectiveness of the proposed robust nonlinear controller is established. The designed controller is applicable as it doesn't need any complicated computation while providing good performance in different operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2006.372674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2006.372674","startPage":"2587","endPage":"2592","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4237510/4237511/04237996.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4237511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Robust Feedback Linearization Controller Design for Thyristor Control Series Capacitor to Damp Electromechanical Oscillations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Feedback Linearization Controller Design for Thyristor Control Series Capacitor to Damp Electromechanical Oscillations","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4237996/","accessionNumber":"9772058","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4237996/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Feedback Linearization Controller Design for Thyristor Control Series Capacitor to Damp Electromechanical Oscillations","confLoc":"Mumbai, India","sourcePdf":"ICIT-00-485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071901S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4237510","isNumber":"4237511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4237510","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4237511","articleId":"4237996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4238003,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The simulation results indicate that the proposed genetic algorithm performs better than the Wong's (1999) subcarrier, bit, and power allocation algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4238956/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9693403","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4238956/","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Genetic Algorithm Approach for Adaptive Subcarrier, Bit, and Power Allocation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic Algorithm Approach for Adaptive Subcarrier, Bit, and Power Allocation","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"ICNSC-00-6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073139S","chronDate":"15-17 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4238949","isNumber":"4238950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4238949","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4238950","articleId":"4238956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4238980,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroshi Inaba","affiliation":["Department of Information Sciences, Tokyo Denki University, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Inaba","id":"37292993600"},{"name":"Tomoki Takahashi","affiliation":["Information Sciences Department, Tokyo Denki University, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomoki","lastName":"Takahashi","id":"37693840500"},{"name":"Keylan Alimhan","affiliation":["Department of Information Sciences, Tokyo Denki University, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Keylan","lastName":"Alimhan","id":"37300703800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1075-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1076-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4238980","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":16},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4238980","abstract":"This paper studies the problem of understanding noisy and structurally deformed two-dimensional images by means of abstractly defined neural works. First, in the framework of systems theory a neural network defined over a Hilbert space is introduced such that any given vectors in the Hilbert space are assigned to locally asymptotically stable fixed points of the network. Then, introducing structural deformation into images a modified neural network is constructed to remove such structural deformation as well as noise. Finally, the modified neural network is used for implementing associative memory of two-dimensional images corrupted by structural deformation as well as noise, and some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the result.","doi":"10.1109/ICNSC.2007.372767","startPage":"145","endPage":"150","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and

of Elliptic-Curve Cryptography on Mobile Healthcare Devices","abstract":"Over the past few years, much research attention has been afforded to the application of remote patient monitoring using embedded mobile devices. However, relatively little research has been done to investigate the security aspects of such scenarios. The present work describes the implementation of a cryptographic algorithm based on elliptic curves on an embedded mobile device useful for healthcare purposes. A personal digital assistant (PDA) has been chosen to be the hardware platform for the implementation as it is particularly suitable for remote patient monitoring applications. The motivation for this paper was to formulate a secure protocol which comprises of signature, encryption and authentication (SEA) as a combined ingredient of secure remote patient monitoring application using mobile devices. This needed to be easy to use and computationally efficient in order to be acceptable to both clinicians and patients and the results indicate a positive outcome.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4238997/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 April 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4238997/","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","accessionNumber":"9693435","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of Elliptic-Curve Cryptography on Mobile Healthcare Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of Elliptic-Curve Cryptography on Mobile Healthcare Devices","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"ICNSC-00-47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041653S","chronDate":"15-17 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4238949","isNumber":"4238950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4238949","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4238950","articleId":"4238997","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4239010,"authors":[{"name":"Azzam I.

Furthermore, an accumulative cluster centers scheme is proposed to properly increase the amount of the data involved into the clustering process. Simulation results show that the fuzzy possibilistic c-means blind channel equalization with accumulative cluster centers outperforms the fuzzy possibilistic c-means blind channel equalization without accumulative cluster centers under the time-varying channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4238949/4238950/04239093.pdf","startPage":"787","endPage":"791","publicationTitle":"2007 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control","doi":"10.1109/ICNSC.2007.372880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNSC.2007.372880","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4238950","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4239093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPCM-Assisted Blind Channel Equalization of M-QAM Signals for Time-Varying Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind equalizers","Time-varying channels","Clustering algorithms","Finite impulse response filter","Intersymbol interference","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Decision feedback equalizers","Channel estimation","Nonlinear filters","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind equalisers","dispersive channels","fuzzy set theory","intersymbol interference","partial response channels","probability","quadrature amplitude modulation","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["M-QAM signals","time-varying channels","intersymbol interference","partial response modems","dispersive channels","fuzzy possibilistic c-means-assisted blind channel equalization scheme","quadrature amplitude modulation","accumulative cluster center scheme","clustering process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blind channel equalization","fuzzy c-mans (FCM) algorithm","fuzzy possibilistic c-means (FPCM) algorithm","inter-symbol interference (ISI)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"FPCM-Assisted Blind Channel Equalization of M-QAM Signals for Time-Varying Channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4239093/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9705787","dateOfInsertion":"25 June 2007","conferenceDate":"15-17 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPCM-Assisted Blind Channel Equalization of M-QAM Signals for Time-Varying Channels","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"ICNSC-00-143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05055S","chronDate":"15-17 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4238949","isNumber":"4238950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4238949","xplore-issue":"4238950","articleId":"4239093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4239104,"authors":[{"name":"Kang Qi","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Kang","lastName":"Qi","id":"37698975800"},{"name":"Wang Lei","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Lei","id":"37336594900"},{"name":"Xiao Hui","affiliation":["College of Electronics and Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Hui","id":"38245263100"},{"name":"Wu Qidi","affiliation":["Ministry of Education of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wu","lastName":"Qidi","id":"37272993200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-1075-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-1076-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4239104","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"abstract":"This paper presents a series of evaluation indexes for intelligent particle swarm optimization based on the basal evaluation index system in the field of intelligent optimization.

This paper proposes such a model for a PEMFC fuel cell system running on gaseous hydrogen and a non-pressurised air supply. The model is composed of a steady-state fuel cell stack model that links the operating conditions (e.g. air flow rate, hydrogen pressure, electrical current, etc.) to the fuel cell stack's electrical voltage. This is complemented by a dynamic, steady state model for the auxiliary systems responsible for maintaining the above operating conditions as a function of the user's interaction. Combining the two models yields an overall, dynamic fuel cell system model that can be used as a basis for implementing advanced control strategies.","doi":"10.1109/PCCON.2007.373005","startPage":"441","endPage":"447","publicationTitle":"2007 Power Conversion Conference - Nagoya","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCON.2007.373005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4239118","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Power Conversion Conference - Nagoya","pdfPath":"/iel5/4239117/4239118/04239195.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Analytical, Control-Oriented State Space Model for a PEM Fuel Cell System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239195/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Analytical, Control-Oriented State Space Model for a PEM Fuel Cell System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4239195/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9702413","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"2-5 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 April 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Analytical, Control-Oriented State Space Model for a PEM Fuel Cell System","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"PCCON-00-77.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05997S","chronDate":"2-5 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4239117","isNumber":"4239118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4239117","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4239118","articleId":"4239195","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4239198,"authors":[{"name":"Jih-Sheng Lai","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Jih-Sheng","lastName":"Lai","id":"37274695000"},{"name":"Sung-Yeul Park","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Sung-Yeul","lastName":"Park","id":"37280896900"},{"name":"Seungryul Moon","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Seungryul","lastName":"Moon","id":"37288034300"},{"name":"Chien Liang Chen","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Chien Liang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293077100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0843-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0844-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4239198","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":595},"abstract":"This paper presents a high-efficiency power conditioning system design that employs a soft-switched dc-dc converter and a soft-switched dc-ac inverter for a low-voltage 26-V, 5-kW solid oxide fuel cell. The dc-dc converter converts fuel cell voltage to a 400-V dc bus voltage using a 3-phase 6-leg phase-shift modulated converter to achieve higher than 96% peak efficiency with zero-voltage zero-current switching. The dc-ac inverter then produces 120/240V ac using a CoolMOS based soft-switching inverter to achieve 98% peak efficiency. The inverter output is universal for both standalone and grid-tie modes operation. The standalone load comes out of two sets of LC filter with a neutral line for equal voltage splits. For grid-tie mode, a circuit breaker needs to turn on, and an additional inductor is included for grid current ripple reduction. Test results indicated that peak efficiency of 94% is achieved for the two-stage power conversion PCS. In addition to high efficiency design, this paper also introduces advanced controls including fuel cell current ripple reduction using a current loop in the dc-dc converter and ac output current steady-state error reduction using an admittance compensation technique in the dc-ac inverter.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power conditioning","Solids","Fuel cells","Inverters","DC-DC power converters","Switching converters","Zero voltage switching","Phase modulation","Zero current switching","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-AC power convertors","DC-DC power convertors","invertors","solid oxide fuel cells","switching convertors","zero current switching","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft-switched power conditioning system","solid oxide fuel cells","dc-dc converter","dc-ac inverter","phase-shift modulated converter","zero-voltage switching","zero-current switching","CoolMOS","grid-tie mode","standalone load","LC filter","neutral line","circuit breaker","grid current ripple reduction","steady-state error reduction","admittance compensation","power 5 kW","voltage 26 V","voltage 400 V","voltage 120 V to 240 V"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Solid oxide fuel cell","power conditioning system","V6 converter","soft switching inverter"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PCCON.2007.373008","publicationTitle":"2007 Power Conversion Conference - Nagoya","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Power Conversion Conference - Nagoya","pdfPath":"/iel5/4239117/4239118/04239198.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4239118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCON.2007.373008","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Efficiency 5-kW Soft-Switched Power Conditioning System for Low-Voltage Solid Oxide Fuel Cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4239198","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A High-Efficiency 5-kW Soft-Switched Power Conditioning System for Low-Voltage Solid Oxide Fuel Cells","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239198/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4239198/","accessionNumber":"9702416","conferenceDate":"2-5 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Efficiency 5-kW Soft-Switched Power Conditioning System for Low-Voltage Solid Oxide Fuel Cells","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"PCCON-00-80.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056082S","chronDate":"2-5 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4239117","isNumber":"4239118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4239117","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4239118","articleId":"4239198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4239205,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Directly coupling thermal and circuit simulators increases the simulation time by orders of magnitude, therefore making such an approach impractical. A well-known solution to this problem is to extract thermal equivalent circuits from 3D-field simulations and to insert them directly into the circuit simulator. In this paper we discuss the poor scaling performance of this state-of-the-art approach. There is an enormous increase in simulation time if there are more than just a few chips thermally modeled. We propose a general procedure at the circuit simulator solver level to increase the calculation speed of such a coupled simulation significantly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239210/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4239210/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9702426","conferenceDate":"2-5 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","displayDocTitle":"Computationally Efficient Integration of Complex Thernal Multi-Chip Power Module Models into Circuit Simulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally Efficient Integration of Complex Thernal Multi-Chip Power Module Models into Circuit Simulators","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"PCCON-00-92.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056763S","chronDate":"2-5 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4239117","isNumber":"4239118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4239117","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4239118","articleId":"4239210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4239219,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In the paper a novel switched reluctance bearingless motor (SRBM) with principles of traditional switched reluctance motors is proposed and its performance characteristics are analysed. Its main difference from other bearingless motors is its owning same single layer of winding structure of a common switched reluctance motor (SRM) and that multi-winding driving is implemented to generate the levitation force and torque. Considering coupling inductance and a developed magnetic flux equation expressing the flux distribution between stator and rotor poles, simulation model and dSPACE experimental model with disturbance force because of displacement have been created to investigate its performance characteristics.

It was reported that the deadbeat control method with FPGA based hardware controller had the very good transient response for various loads, but these reports were mainly focused on a few KW class PWM inverter system, so the high carrier frequency were adopted. But in MW class PWM inverter system, the carrier frequency is limited up to 2 kHz range, because of the performance of the switching devices and the trade off against the efficiency of the inverter. In this condition, the controllability of the PWM inverter is not so much expected. In the proposed method, to ensure the tracking accuracy of the output voltage to the reference voltage, more than two sampled data is used while one carrier interval. The control characteristics of the proposed variable sampling deadbeat control is verified through simulations and experiments.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Pulse width modulation inverters","Frequency","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Control systems","Voltage","Feedback control","Transient response","Controllability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital control","feedback","field programmable gate arrays","PWM invertors","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable sampling quasi multirate deadbeat control method","single phase PWM inverter","real time digital feedback control","FPGA"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PCCON.2007.373059","publicationTitle":"2007 Power Conversion Conference - Nagoya","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Power Conversion Conference - Nagoya","pdfPath":"/iel5/4239117/4239118/04239249.pdf","startPage":"804","endPage":"809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4239118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCON.2007.373059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable Sampling Quasi Multirate Deadbeat Control Method for Single Phase PWM Inverter in Low Carrier Frequency","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4239249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Variable Sampling Quasi Multirate Deadbeat Control Method for Single Phase PWM Inverter in Low Carrier Frequency","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239249/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4239249/","accessionNumber":"9702466","conferenceDate":"2-5 April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 April 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable Sampling Quasi Multirate Deadbeat Control Method for Single Phase PWM Inverter in Low Carrier Frequency","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"PCCON-00-131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069908S","chronDate":"2-5 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4239117","isNumber":"4239118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4239117","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4239118","articleId":"4239249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":4239250,"authors":[{"name":"Hironori Abe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hironori","lastName":"Abe","id":"37687194800"},{"name":"Hiroshi Fujimoto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Fujimoto","id":"37289580800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0843-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0844-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4239250","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Pulse width modulation inverters","Error correction","Engineering profession","Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation","Feedback loop","Output feedback","Active filters","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multirate perfect tracking control","single-phase inverter","inter sampling","arbitrary waveform","single-rate deadbeat control","nonlinear rectifier load"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["inter sampling","single-phase inverter","multirate control","deadbeat control","arbitrary waveform"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4239250","abstract":"In this paper, multirate perfect tracking control is proposed for a single-phase inverter.

This trend mainly has a major impact on the power electronics part of these systems. Up to now, full-bridge converters have been used in order to independently control the phases of the active magnetic bearing and the drive system. With the use of an interleaved half-bridge topology the number of required power semiconductors is reduced by 25%. In this paper, novel modulation techniques are presented and comparatively evaluated in order to achieve a similar dynamic performance of the pump system as with the conventional full-bridge topology. The effects of a phase shift and of higher harmonics in the duty cycles are analyzed in detail. The proposed concepts are then implemented on a DSP board and their feasibility is shown on a highly compact 1.5 kW prototype of a converter which is realized with two integrated three-phase power modules. Furthermore, it is shown that the higher harmonics injection does not have an impact on the average speed of the impeller and thus on the constant output flow of the pump.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modulation Concepts for the Control of a Two-Phase Bearingless Slice Motor Utilizing Three-Phase Power Modules","publicationTitle":"2007 Power Conversion Conference - Nagoya","doi":"10.1109/PCCON.2007.373061","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Power Conversion Conference - Nagoya","pdfPath":"/iel5/4239117/4239118/04239251.pdf","startPage":"816","endPage":"823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCON.2007.373061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4239118","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4239251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239251/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Modulation Concepts for the Control of a Two-Phase Bearingless Slice Motor Utilizing Three-Phase Power Modules","conferenceDate":"2-5 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4239251/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9702468","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modulation Concepts for the Control of a Two-Phase Bearingless Slice Motor Utilizing Three-Phase Power Modules","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"PCCON-00-133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086044S","chronDate":"2-5 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4239117","isNumber":"4239118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4239117","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4239118","articleId":"4239251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4239294,"authors":[{"name":"Antti Piippo","affiliation":["Power Electronics Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"Piippo","id":"37266803500"},{"name":"Janne Salomaki","affiliation":["Power Electronics Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Salomaki","id":"37294093600"},{"name":"Jorma Luomi","affiliation":["Power Electronics Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Jorma","lastName":"Luomi","id":"37272562400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0843-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0844-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4239294","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":386},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filters","Voltage","Pulse width modulation inverters","Magnetic separation","AC motors","Reluctance motors","Current measurement","Synchronous motors","Machine vector control","Sensorless control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","machine control","observers","permanent magnet motors","power filters","synchronous motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal injection","sensorless PMSM drives","inverter output LC filter","hybrid observer","sensorless control","permanent magnet synchronous motor","full-order observer","high-frequency signal injection method","inverter phase currents"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverter output filter","permanent magnet motors","sensorless control","signal injection"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4239294","doi":"10.1109/PCCON.2007.373104","publicationTitle":"2007 Power Conversion Conference - Nagoya","abstract":"The paper proposes a hybrid observer for sensorless control of permanent magnet synchronous motor drives equipped with an inverter output LC filter.

Solving the equations of the optimization procedure described in this paper can be performed numerically without much effort, but manufacturing the resulting optimum heat sink is often extremely difficult and expensive, and therefore impractical. Based on the optimization theory, the sensitivity of the thermal resistance of the heat sink to changes in the geometric design parameters is discussed. Diagrams show the expected increase in thermal resistance if the manufacturing process constrains the fin thickness to certain values. Based on this, one can design a sub-optimum heat sink that gives the minimum thermal resistance for a certain manufacturing procedure. Furthermore, it is shown how much additional manufacturing effort would be necessary to further improve the performance of the heat sink. The proposed procedure is verified experimentally.","doi":"10.1109/PCCON.2007.373116","publicationTitle":"2007 Power Conversion Conference - Nagoya","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Power Conversion Conference - Nagoya","pdfPath":"/iel5/4239117/4239118/04239306.pdf","startPage":"1189","endPage":"1194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCON.2007.373116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4239118","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4239306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-Optimum Design of a Forced Air Cooled Heat Sink for Simple Manufacturing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sub-Optimum Design of a Forced Air Cooled Heat Sink for Simple Manufacturing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 April 2007","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4239306/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9702519","conferenceDate":"2-5 April 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-Optimum Design of a Forced Air Cooled Heat Sink for Simple Manufacturing","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"PCCON-00-188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032677S","chronDate":"2-5 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4239117","isNumber":"4239118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4239117","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4239118","articleId":"4239306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4239309,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Conventional modifications to the doubly fed induction generation (DFIG) architecture for providing ride-through result in limited control of the turbine shaft and grid current during fault events. A DFIG architecture in which the grid side converter is connected in series as opposed to parallel with the grid connection has shown improved low voltage ride through but poor power processing capabilities. In this paper a unified DFIG wind turbine architecture which employs a parallel grid side rectifier and series grid side converter is presented.

To take advantage of this, the solid state transfer switch (STS) is adopted to protect the sensitive load against the voltage sag. However, the fast transfer process may cause in-rush current on the load-side transformer due to the resulting DC offset in its magnetic flux as the load-transfer is completed. The in-rush current can reach 8~30 p.u. and it may trigger the over-current protections on the power feeder. This paper develops a flux estimation scheme and a thyristor gating logic based on the impulse commutation bridge STS (ICBSTS) to minimize the DC offset on the magnetic flux. By sensing the line voltages of both feeders, the flux estimator can predict the peak transient flux linkage at the moment of load-transfer and evaluate a suitable timing for the transfer to minimize the inrush current. Laboratory test results are presented to validate the performance of the proposed system.","doi":"10.1109/PCCON.2007.373191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PCCON.2007.373191","publicationTitle":"2007 Power Conversion Conference - Nagoya","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 Power Conversion Conference - Nagoya","pdfPath":"/iel5/4239117/4239118/04239381.pdf","startPage":"1698","endPage":"1705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4239118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239381/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"An In-rush Current Suppression Technique for the Solid-State Transfer Switch System","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 April 2007","accessionNumber":"9708154","htmlLink":"/document/4239381/","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An In-rush Current Suppression Technique for the Solid-State Transfer Switch System","confLoc":"Nagoya, Japan","sourcePdf":"PCCON-00-263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083872S","chronDate":"2-5 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4239117","isNumber":"4239118","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4239117","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4239118","articleId":"4239381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4239392,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Hung Lin","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Hung","lastName":"Lin","id":"37633059700"},{"name":"Ho-Che Yu","affiliation":["RD Center, Springsoft Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ho-Che","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085497745"},{"name":"Tian-Hau Tsai","affiliation":["RD Center, Springsoft Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tian-Hau","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37087035032"},{"name":"Shyh-Chang Lin","affiliation":["RD Center, Springsoft Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyh-Chang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37556180600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0582-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0583-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4239392","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":773},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Databases","Pattern matching","Design automation","Circuit analysis","Constraint optimization","Design engineering","Analog circuits","Lakes","Large-scale systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue circuits","network routing","network synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matching-based placement","routing system","analog design","custom layout design automation","device-level matching-placement","extracts matching devices","pattern database","constraint-driven shape-based router"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4239392","abstract":"Matching placement and routing is very important in layout design of high performance analog circuits. This paper presents a matching-based placement and routing system for custom layout design automation especially for analog or mixed-signal designs. The system explores various device-level matching-placement and matching-routing patterns to generate the most compact and high-quality layouts. Inputting a circuit netlist, the system automatically analyzes the circuit and extracts matching devices to form several matching device groups. Then, it selects the best matching placement and routing pattern for each device or device group to optimize and to meet the overall placement objectives and constraints. All patterns are user-configurable, stored in the pattern database, and portable from design to design. After the layout of each device and device group is generated and placed, the constraint-driven shape-based router is invoked to complete the layout. The overall system can easily generate high-quality layouts and greatly reduce the layout design time.","doi":"10.1109/VDAT.2007.373200","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (VLSI-DAT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VDAT.2007.373200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4239383","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (VLSI-DAT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4239382/4239383/04239392.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Matching-based Placement and Routing System for Analog Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239392/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Matching-based Placement and Routing System for Analog Design","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4239392/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9693494","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Matching-based Placement and Routing System for Analog Design","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"VDAT-00-9.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052918S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4239382","isNumber":"4239383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4239382","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4239383","articleId":"4239392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4239394,"authors":[{"name":"Shyh-Shyuan Sheu","affiliation":["ITRI, Electronics and Opto-electronics Research Laboratories, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyh-Shyuan","lastName":"Sheu","id":"37410797200"},{"name":"Lieh-Chiu Lin","affiliation":["ITRI, Electronics and Opto-electronics Research Laboratories, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Lieh-Chiu","lastName":"Lin","id":"37696268900"},{"name":"Wen-Han Wang","affiliation":["ITRI, Electronics and Opto-electronics Research Laboratories, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wen-Han","lastName":"Wang","id":"37696474500"},{"name":"Pei-Chia Chiang","affiliation":["ITRI, Electronics and Opto-electronics Research Laboratories, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Chia","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37397204200"},{"name":"Keng-Li Su","affiliation":["ITRI, Electronics and Opto-electronics Research Laboratories, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Keng-Li","lastName":"Su","id":"37289576600"},{"name":"Ming-Jer Kao","affiliation":["ITRI, Electronics and Opto-electronics Research Laboratories, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Jer","lastName":"Kao","id":"37285787200"},{"name":"Ming-Jinn Tsai","affiliation":["ITRI, Electronics and Opto-electronics Research Laboratories, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Jinn","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37275600300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0582-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0583-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4239394","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":181},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"4-Mb SPI Flash Compatible Phase-Change Memory","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (VLSI-DAT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4239382/4239383/04239394.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (VLSI-DAT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VDAT.2007.373202","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4239383","doi":"10.1109/VDAT.2007.373202","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change memory","Phase change materials","Clocks","Flash memory","Circuits","MOS devices","CMOS process","Space vector pulse width modulation","Voltage-controlled oscillators","Ring oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash memories","peripheral interfaces","phase change materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flash compatible SPI memory","serial interface phase-change memory","peripheral circuit","sector erase time","bulk erase time","storage capacity 4 Mbit"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4239394","abstract":"A 4-Mb with SPI serial interface phase-change memory which is completely compatible with the traditional SPI flash memory is implemented in this study.

In RTL design, we use pre-computation, differential encoding, hardware sharing, time-multiplexing R/W of memory, low power arithmetic architecture so that each block can reduce power from 3% to 26%. In system level, the proposed DPM (dynamic power manager) is a power control unit for our system. When the system enters the offset tracking mode, the DPM controls the power states of system blocks between the GI (guard interval) period and symbol period. The power reduction ratio ranges from 3%~20% (it depends on the Gl mode). Moreover, a predicted phase scheme is proposed to provide the initial phase offset for the start of symbol period during offset tracking mode. The overall reduction for synchronization loop is about 50% in both hardware area and power.","doi":"10.1109/VDAT.2007.373245","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (VLSI-DAT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (VLSI-DAT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4239382/4239383/04239437.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VDAT.2007.373245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4239383","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low Power and Power Aware Design for DVB-T/H Baseband Inner Receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4239437","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low Power and Power Aware Design for DVB-T/H Baseband Inner Receiver","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239437/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2007","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9693539","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4239437/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low Power and Power Aware Design for DVB-T/H Baseband Inner Receiver","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"VDAT-00-54.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07531S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4239382","isNumber":"4239383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4239382","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4239383","articleId":"4239437","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4239438,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan-Jyue Chen","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yuan-Jyue","lastName":"Chen","id":"37635417800"},{"name":"Kai-Yuan Jheng","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kai-Yuan","lastName":"Jheng","id":"37267308000"},{"name":"An-Yeu Wu","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"An-Yeu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37271932500"},{"name":"Hen-Wai Tsao","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Hen-Wai","lastName":"Tsao","id":"37277278800"},{"name":"Bosen Tzeng","affiliation":["MediaTek, Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Bosen","lastName":"Tzeng","id":"37283093600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0582-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0583-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4239438","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":28,"totalDownloads":419},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Linearity","Power combiners","High power amplifiers","Linearization techniques","Multiaccess communication","Power amplifiers","Degradation","Baseband","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","linearisation techniques","power combiners","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless transmitters","power linearization method","power efficiency","nonlinear components","linear amplifier","LINC system design","efficiency 44.5 percent to 80.8 percent"]}],"abstract":"Linear amplifier with nonlinear components (LINC) is a power linearization method which offers both high linearity and high power amplifier (PA) efficiency in wireless transmitters. While LINC increases the power efficiency of PAs, this linearization technique requires an extra power combiner which results in low power efficiency of whole system. To improve this drawback, we propose a multi-level LINC (ML-LINC) method to not only increase power combiner efficiency but also maintain high linearity of wireless transmitters. We also derive the optimal value of each scaling level to maximize the power combiner efficiency.

Also, 12% sensing speed could be enhanced when Pseudo SRAM is operated in normal mode (simulated with TSMC 100 nm technology model).","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (VLSI-DAT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (VLSI-DAT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4239382/4239383/04239443.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Gating Technique for Embedded Pseudo SRAM","doi":"10.1109/VDAT.2007.373251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4239383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VDAT.2007.373251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4239443","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Power Gating Technique for Embedded Pseudo SRAM","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9693552","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4239443/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Gating Technique for Embedded Pseudo SRAM","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"VDAT-00-60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040663S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4239382","isNumber":"4239383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4239382","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4239383","articleId":"4239443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4239449,"authors":[{"name":"Lingfeng Li","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Production and Systems, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Lingfeng","lastName":"Li","id":"37293046200"},{"name":"Yang Song","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Production and Systems, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Song","id":"37293363900"},{"name":"Takeshi Ikenaga","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Production and Systems, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Ikenaga","id":"37281527900"},{"name":"Satoshi Goto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Production and Systems, Waseda University, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Goto","id":"37279993400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0582-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0583-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4239449","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":302},"abstract":"This paper presents a hardware architecture for Context-Based Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding (CABAC) codec in H.264/AVC main profile.

Power management technique is then required to bring down the power consumption. One of the most effective methods is to reduce the power supply voltage in the standby mode or in the power down active mode. In this paper, a simple on-chip voltage down converter is proposed. By designing an internal reference voltage that is proportional to the device threshold voltage, the SRAM cell circuit states can be preserved within a broad range of power supply and temperature. For the 1V-to-0.6V dc-dc conversion, this on-chip VDC only consumes 156 muW standby power and is within 2 mV output voltage variation for load current varying from 1 mu A to 10 mA. By comparing with other power management techniques, the on-chip VDC method is excellent in the static power saving, overall design simplicity and small layout area.","doi":"10.1109/VDAT.2007.372757","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (VLSI-DAT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (VLSI-DAT)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4239382/4239383/04239451.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VDAT.2007.372757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4239383","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4239451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Chip VDC Circuit for SRAM Power Management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239451/","displayDocTitle":"On-Chip VDC Circuit for SRAM Power Management","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4239451/","publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"18 June 2007","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2007","accessionNumber":"9693553","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Chip VDC Circuit for SRAM Power Management","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"VDAT-00-68.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055808S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4239382","isNumber":"4239383","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4239382","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4239383","articleId":"4239451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4239452,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The investigation of thermal effect and electrical properties on LTSI confirm that this newly low-cost interconnect technology could be a good candidate for both wafer stacking application and 3D SiP module.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239493/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","accessionNumber":"9694428","htmlLink":"/document/4239493/","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"3D Chip-to-Chip Stacking with Through Silicon Interconnects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D Chip-to-Chip Stacking with Through Silicon Interconnects","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"VLSI-TSA-00-35.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040103S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4239457","isNumber":"4239458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4239457","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4239458","articleId":"4239493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4239502,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The basic physics of program and erase methods sets the foundation for low power and high reliability margins for both endurance and data retention. Second generation SuperFlash with smaller memory cell size maintains this fundamental advantage for SoC scaling. Using self-aligned word lines and source lines avoids the alignment factor of scaling.

Besides, a four-state sense amplifier is proposed to reduce the read access time to less than 25 ns for two accessing data in one cycle. With adequate I/O stages, the 1T2UMTJ toggle MRAM architecture has a double word length or alternatively has a high read/write bandwidth. The two-bit data can be read from or written into a selected memory cell of 1T2UMTJ toggle MRAM within one clock cycle, therefore, demonstrating the promising property of high bandwidth processing capability.","doi":"10.1109/VTSA.2007.378949","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on VLSI Technology, Systems and Applications (VLSI-TSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on VLSI Technology, Systems and Applications (VLSI-TSA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4239457/4239458/04239517.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTSA.2007.378949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4239458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel 1T2UMTJ toggle MRAM with high read/write bandwidth interface","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239517/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"A novel 1T2UMTJ toggle MRAM with high read/write bandwidth interface","dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4239517/","accessionNumber":"9705882","publicationDate":"April 2007","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel 1T2UMTJ toggle MRAM with high read/write bandwidth interface","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"VLSI-TSA-00-59.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038944S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4239457","isNumber":"4239458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4239457","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4239458","articleId":"4239517","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4239534,"authors":[{"name":"Keunwoo Kim","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

The core concept is to further weaken the strength of NL through device design and technology/process means beyond that achievable by the conventional device sizing or circuit scheme, thus achieving Read SNM comparable to the standby SNM. These methods improve/maximize the SNM of asymmetrical SRAM cell without degrading read/write performance, leakage/dynamic power, and area/density. They are also more scalable for low voltage operations. Write margin and performance can be noticeably improved by further device optimization.","doi":"10.1109/VTSA.2007.378966","publicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on VLSI Technology, Systems and Applications (VLSI-TSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 International Symposium on VLSI Technology, Systems and Applications (VLSI-TSA)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4239457/4239458/04239534.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VTSA.2007.378966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4239458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymmetrical SRAM Cells with Enhanced Read and Write Margins","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4239534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 April 2007","displayDocTitle":"Asymmetrical SRAM Cells with Enhanced Read and Write Margins","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2007","accessionNumber":"9705895","htmlLink":"/document/4239534/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 July 2007","conferenceDate":"23-25 April 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymmetrical SRAM Cells with Enhanced Read and Write Margins","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"VLSI-TSA-00-76.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039045S","chronDate":"23-25 April 2007","xplore-pub-id":"4239457","isNumber":"4239458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4239457","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4239458","articleId":"4239534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"}]
